series.\"},{\"currTime\":207,\"text\":\"You'll freak out.\"},{\"currTime\":208,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":209,\"text\":\"And she's been texting me updates as she's watching it, like, can't believe it.\"},{\"currTime\":212,\"text\":\"Just all emojis.\"},{\"currTime\":213,\"text\":\"So basically, yeah, go watch it, but this, this chick's husband fucking killed her because\"},{\"currTime\":218,\"text\":\"she found out that he was having like a child molester or something, right?\"},{\"currTime\":222,\"text\":\"No, no, no.\"},{\"currTime\":223,\"text\":\"He was having a fair, he was like paying for male prostitutes.\"},{\"currTime\":228,\"text\":\"And she found out like right before he murdered her.\"},{\"currTime\":230,\"text\":\"I mean, that the owl

works.\"},{\"currTime\":249,\"text\":\"It's so crazy.\"},{\"currTime\":250,\"text\":\"But, but I understand there, you know, there's people making argument that like he got railroaded\"},{\"currTime\":254,\"text\":\"because of the male prostitute thing and painted a picture of him that wasn't real or whatever.\"},{\"currTime\":261,\"text\":\"But I, that's still bullshit

Southern people aren't\"},{\"currTime\":271,\"text\":\"the tolerant, the Southern and I'll be intolerant by saying all Southern people are intolerant.\"},{\"currTime\":277,\"text\":\"But it's absolutely true across the board.\"},{\"currTime\":280,\"text\":\"There you go.\"},{\"currTime\":281,\"text\":\"That's what we're about big, big facts and truths.\"},{\"currTime\":284,\"text\":\"So

wife.\"},{\"currTime\":299,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":300,\"text\":\"Spoiler is that an owl did it.\"},{\"currTime\":302,\"text\":\"That's exactly right.\"},{\"currTime\":304,\"text\":\"Good point.\"},{\"currTime\":305,\"text\":\"So we're going to, so this is, are we, we're calling this my favorite murder?\"},{\"currTime\":308,\"text\":\"Are we recording?\"},{\"currTime\":309,\"text\":\"So do you want to start with this?\"},{\"currTime\":312,\"text\":\"Is this what we're, should we start my favorite murder and it's going to be real fucked up\"},{\"currTime\":317,\"text\":\"and Dustin brought up a great point that we might be inviting a murderer into our lives\"},{\"currTime\":320,\"text\":\"by doing this.\"},{\"currTime\":321,\"text\":\"I mean, but here's the thing and this is why I'm so fascinated by this topic in general.\"},{\"currTime\":325,\"text\":\"We might already know a murderer.\"},{\"currTime\":326,\"text\":\"Oh my God, like probably.\"},{\"currTime\":329,\"text\":\"Probably and in that way where they're just in a very cat-like removed Dexter way, just\"},{\"currTime\":335,\"text\":\"observing all this for the kind of, oh, they think they're, they think they're cute.\"},{\"currTime\":338,\"text\":\"Isn't that cute?\"},{\"currTime\":339,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":340,\"text\":\"Isn't that cute than quaint?\"},{\"currTime\":341,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":342,\"text\":\"So I guess the disclaimers really don't kill us because we can't do this podcast anymore\"},{\"currTime\":345,\"text\":\"if you can.\"},{\"currTime\":346,\"text\":\"I mean, and another part of that disclaimer could be partly like we kind of are fans,\"},{\"currTime\":350,\"text\":\"a lot of murdering people, like we're your friends, we're, we, what it is, is I, I think\"},{\"currTime\":356,\"text\":\"what you're doing is wrong.\"},{\"currTime\":357,\"text\":\"I wish you'd stop it.\"},{\"currTime\":358,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":359,\"text\":\"But you probably knew too.\"},{\"currTime\":360,\"text\":\"You do too.\"},{\"currTime\":361,\"text\":\"We know we've seen the specials where you talk about wanting to stop and not being able\"},{\"currTime\":364,\"text\":\"to stop.\"},{\"currTime\":365,\"text\":\"Definitely.\"},{\"currTime\":366,\"text\":\"But at the same time, like the level of planning, I mean, I got here 15 minutes late and this\"},{\"currTime\":371,\"text\":\"is something I want to do.\"},{\"currTime\":374,\"text\":\"Like their, their, their shit is together, those serial killers.\"},{\"currTime\":377,\"text\":\"So the thought of like for me, it's like you got away with it for like the thought of getting\"},{\"currTime\":382,\"text\":\"away with something like that is insane.\"},{\"currTime\":385,\"text\":\"And the fact that like the rest of your life are you, you're either worrying constantly\"},{\"currTime\":389,\"text\":\"that you're going to get caught or you're a sociopath and you just don't worry about\"},{\"currTime\":392,\"text\":\"that shit.\"},{\"currTime\":393,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":394,\"text\":\"Which would not be great.\"},{\"currTime\":395,\"text\":\"Oh my God.\"},{\"currTime\":396,\"text\":\"It would be so great.\"},{\"currTime\":397,\"text\":\"I mean, right now I have, I'm pretty sure I have two unpaid parking tickets.\"},{\"currTime\":399,\"text\":\"So I live in constant.\"},{\"currTime\":401,\"text\":\"Will I get the third and a boot in front of people I know it's constant.\"},{\"currTime\":406,\"text\":\"And it's tearing me apart.\"},{\"currTime\":408,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":409,\"text\":\"And it'd be great.\"},{\"currTime\":410,\"text\":\"The only thing you have to worry about is getting caught for murder, for murdering many\"},{\"currTime\":413,\"text\":\"people that part their hair down the middle or whatever your preference is.\"},{\"currTime\":417,\"text\":\"Ted Bundy.\"},{\"currTime\":418,\"text\":\"Am I right girl?\"},{\"currTime\":419,\"text\":\"Did I just spoil your favorite murder?\"},{\"currTime\":421,\"text\":\"Don't tell me.\"},{\"currTime\":422,\"text\":\"No, no, no.\"},{\"currTime\":423,\"text\":\"So like, you know, what you did was pick up on the reference I was dropping like an expert.\"},{\"currTime\":427,\"text\":\"Oh, I fucking got this.\"},{\"currTime\":428,\"text\":\"This is why I reference this because we love murder.\"},{\"currTime\":432,\"text\":\"And the one time I was stoned at a party and decided to tell people one of the worst things\"},{\"currTime\":438,\"text\":\"I've ever seen.\"},{\"currTime\":439,\"text\":\"I made people blanch and walk away from our, from our circle and Georgia moved closer with\"},{\"currTime\":445,\"text\":\"the white eye.\"},{\"currTime\":446,\"text\":\"She has right now going, oh my God, this is amazing.\"},{\"currTime\":449,\"text\":\"It's when I, I don't know why I did it.\"},{\"currTime\":451,\"text\":\"I do.\"},{\"currTime\":452,\"text\":\"This is part of my problem.\"},{\"currTime\":453,\"text\":\"Oh my God.\"},{\"currTime\":454,\"text\":\"Tell me I love it.\"},{\"currTime\":455,\"text\":\"It was when, I think it was at that same party.\"},{\"currTime\":457,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":458,\"text\":\"Somebody asked me what had been going on lately and it was right after I got back from South\"},{\"currTime\":461,\"text\":\"by Southwest or not right after for some reason the South by Southwest, the car accident\"},{\"currTime\":466,\"text\":\"came up and my big brag, which never pans out as a brag.\"},{\"currTime\":470,\"text\":\"I always think it is like how fascinating about me and no one ever agrees is that I\"},{\"currTime\":475,\"text\":\"was there when it happened and I didn't see it.\"},{\"currTime\":478,\"text\":\"My back was to it.\"},{\"currTime\":479,\"text\":\"I heard it.\"},{\"currTime\":480,\"text\":\"Tell everyone what it was.\"},{\"currTime\":481,\"text\":\"Oh, sorry.\"},{\"currTime\":482,\"text\":\"Um, in at South by Southwest two years ago, a guy was in a police chase and he turned up\"},{\"currTime\":487,\"text\":\"a street that was cordoned off, um, for people to mill about cause it was a festival.\"},{\"currTime\":493,\"text\":\"And so all the people standing in the street in

rockers.\"},{\"currTime\":501,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":502,\"text\":\"And I had been standing last in line to get in.\"},{\"currTime\":506,\"text\":\"So I would have been the first person hit, but I decided to walk away.\"},{\"currTime\":509,\"text\":\"Good for you.\"},{\"currTime\":510,\"text\":\"I mean, like, fuck this shit.\"},{\"currTime\":511,\"text\":\"I'm over it.\"},{\"currTime\":512,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":513,\"text\":\"Cause you know me in lines and waiting and how I don't go anywhere or do anything.\"},{\"currTime\":516,\"text\":\"So I walked away to see my friend at the front, like, Hey, let's just stand out here and listen\"},{\"currTime\":520,\"text\":\"to the music.\"},{\"currTime\":522,\"text\":\"The car comes, people fly like cardboard boxes.\"},{\"currTime\":525,\"text\":\"I tell this story in groups of people and people are literally like bumming out hard.\"},{\"currTime\":530,\"text\":\"And I had just read about it that afternoon and I was like, Oh, tell me everything.\"},{\"currTime\":533,\"text\":\"Cause that's my like car accidents are another thing.\"},{\"currTime\":537,\"text\":\"I've had two ex-boyfriends and

know.\"},{\"currTime\":555,\"text\":\"So like, I'm just fucking want to hear all about it.\"},{\"currTime\":557,\"text\":\"And I'm also, I'm also big in like anything could happen at any moment.\"},{\"currTime\":560,\"text\":\"You'll never know about it.\"},{\"currTime\":561,\"text\":\"Like I don't sit near a window at a restaurant because I am like a car is going to come creaning\"},{\"currTime\":566,\"text\":\"through the fucking window and kill me.\"},{\"currTime\":568,\"text\":\"Sure.\"},{\"currTime\":569,\"text\":\"So that's just to me is like, tell me everything so I can avoid it.\"},{\"currTime\":572,\"text\":\"Yes.\"},{\"currTime\":573,\"text\":\"That's what, that's what all this is really.\"},{\"currTime\":574,\"text\":\"I just want to collect information and hear theories and stories so that I can be braced\"},{\"currTime\":580,\"text\":\"so that when I see the weird, you know, that the one thing's out of the knife, I'm ready.\"},{\"currTime\":585,\"text\":\"Totally.\"},{\"currTime\":586,\"text\":\"Like why is there an open soda can?\"},{\"currTime\":588,\"text\":\"Yes.\"},{\"currTime\":589,\"text\":\"I didn't open

dick.\"},{\"currTime\":696,\"text\":\"Driving crazy.\"},{\"currTime\":697,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":698,\"text\":\"And then he hit something, flipped his car, was shot out through the

daughter.\"},{\"currTime\":2130,\"text\":\"She's kind of making it more generalized.\"},{\"currTime\":2132,\"text\":\"She's setting up a story.\"},{\"currTime\":2133,\"text\":\"It sounds like.\"},{\"currTime\":2134,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":2135,\"text\":\"And there's all these interpretations people say about like, you know, um, not asking\"},{\"currTime\":2138,\"text\":\"for help.\"},{\"currTime\":2139,\"text\":\"They're saying for the, her daughter, she's like begging for someone to, to deal with\"},{\"currTime\":2145,\"text\":\"it instead of asking for help for her

is\"},{\"currTime\":2152,\"text\":\"because that they said that their son, who was like 10 was asleep upstairs until like\"},{\"currTime\":2156,\"text\":\"after the police had got there.\"},{\"currTime\":2157,\"text\":\"But in the background with analysis, with the 911 call, you can hear his voice.\"},{\"currTime\":2162,\"text\":\"Oh yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":2164,\"text\":\"And there's just all these little things.\"},{\"currTime\":2165,\"text\":\"Oh, so it could be like some family event took place and this was like the cleanup version.\"},{\"currTime\":2173,\"text\":\"Well another weird thing is that they're, so they found pineapple during the autopsy in\"},{\"currTime\":2177,\"text\":\"her stomach that she had eaten before she died because it hadn't been

nightmare.\"},{\"currTime\":3073,\"text\":\"And then the surrounding suburbs, uh, like citrus heights and these kind of like outline\"},{\"currTime\":3078,\"text\":\"went and this area where this East

second half.\"},{\"currTime\":3099,\"text\":\"That's right.\"},{\"currTime\":3100,\"text\":\"He was the East area rapist and he wasn't killing people yet.\"},{\"currTime\":3103,\"text\":\"He was just raping women.\"},{\"currTime\":3106,\"text\":\"He was breaking into houses.\"},{\"currTime\":3107,\"text\":\"So he did the thing.\"},{\"currTime\":3108,\"text\":\"He did the recon the day before.\"},{\"currTime\":3110,\"text\":\"He would go, oftentimes people would say we heard something on the roof and we didn't\"},{\"currTime\":3114,\"text\":\"even look.\"},{\"currTime\":3115,\"text\":\"Oh my God.\"},{\"currTime\":3116,\"text\":\"That's why I brought that thing up earlier.\"},{\"currTime\":3118,\"text\":\"He would also break into the houses and

ready.\"},{\"currTime\":3127,\"text\":\"So they're ready.\"},{\"currTime\":3128,\"text\":\"So he was all ready.\"},{\"currTime\":3129,\"text\":\"Oh my God.\"},{\"currTime\":3130,\"text\":\"He didn't even want to throw up just now.\"},{\"currTime\":3133,\"text\":\"He was sinister.\"},{\"currTime\":3138,\"text\":\"And then so basically then he would break into their house the night of, turn the

them.\"},{\"currTime\":3152,\"text\":\"He'd have his ski mask.\"},{\"currTime\":3154,\"text\":\"And then he would tell the woman to tie up the man.\"},{\"currTime\":3159,\"text\":\"Then he would go to the kitchen and get a stack of dishes and bring it back and stick\"},{\"currTime\":3161,\"text\":\"it on the man's back.\"},{\"currTime\":3163,\"text\":\"And then he would say to the man, if I hear these dishes move, I will kill both of you.\"},{\"currTime\":3169,\"text\":\"Then he'd take the woman usually, I think it was like half and half, but I think most\"},{\"currTime\":3172,\"text\":\"of the time you would take the woman out into the front room and he would tie her up there\"},{\"currTime\":3176,\"text\":\"and rape her while the husband could hear in the bedroom.\"},{\"currTime\":3181,\"text\":\"Sometimes he would do it there.\"},{\"currTime\":3183,\"text\":\"And then so in the beginning he was just raping the woman and leaving both of

himself?\"},{\"currTime\":3193,\"text\":\"Which is just think of it, just think of, so you're already in this like craze

you're jolted out of sleep to this weird like, what the fuck?\"},{\"currTime\":3212,\"text\":\"And then it's like, someone is talking like this, you know what I mean?\"},{\"currTime\":3215,\"text\":\"Like, there was one thing I just read where he said he was, he was repeating to himself,\"},{\"currTime\":3219,\"text\":\"I'm going to kill him.\"},{\"currTime\":3220,\"text\":\"I'm going to kill him.\"},{\"currTime\":3221,\"text\":\"Like chanting it to himself as he was tying them up.\"},{\"currTime\":3225,\"text\":\"Fuck

like that, like 2020.\"},{\"currTime\":3290,\"text\":\"So it was like the murders in Goleta and Ventura and Dana Point.\"},{\"currTime\":3296,\"text\":\"And then separately, they would report on the

what's okay.\"},{\"currTime\":3311,\"text\":\"So here's the thing.\"},{\"currTime\":3312,\"text\":\"They never fuck.\"},{\"currTime\":3313,\"text\":\"And you know, I was, they said that maybe he was a

were\"},{\"currTime\":3322,\"text\":\"set up.\"},{\"currTime\":3323,\"text\":\"Right.\"},{\"currTime\":3324,\"text\":\"So they found a map once that, that was hand drawn, but when he would get caught

things.\"},{\"currTime\":3335,\"text\":\"So there would be a neighbor that would like flip on a light and be like, Hey, and then\"},{\"currTime\":3339,\"text\":\"they would watch him run and vault

community meeting, you know, he was there, right?\"},{\"currTime\":3372,\"text\":\"Well, yeah, that's, so, uh, and this, somebody, somebody took a picture of it for the paper.\"},{\"currTime\":3378,\"text\":\"No.\"},{\"currTime\":3379,\"text\":\"So they have a group shot.\"},{\"currTime\":3380,\"text\":\"Oh, of this town meeting.\"},{\"currTime\":3383,\"text\":\"And

that\"},{\"currTime\":3404,\"text\":\"the couple of times there was a guy walking a dog, but every time they described the guys\"},{\"currTime\":3408,\"text\":\"looking white and like fit and normal, like it's that kind of thing, um, where they, it's\"},{\"currTime\":3416,\"text\":\"the person who can fit in and is totally fitting in and being like a weird murder, cuttlefish\"},{\"currTime\":3422,\"text\":\"fitting in and then disappearing.\"},{\"currTime\":3424,\"text\":\"So, but my favorite thing is so they had this town meeting and at one point the cops are\"},{\"currTime\":3429,\"text\":\"just saying, this is happening and people are really angry because it's so many.\"},{\"currTime\":3434,\"text\":\"It's like in the thirties at this point and this

harder.\"},{\"currTime\":3515,\"text\":\"The crime's so much harder.\"},{\"currTime\":3516,\"text\":\"So he's clearly specifically doing it for a reason.\"},{\"currTime\":3520,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":3521,\"text\":\"And he's doing it so much, like he just did it and kept on doing it.\"},{\"currTime\":3525,\"text\":\"It was just a thing that was happening in Sacramento for years.\"},{\"currTime\":3528,\"text\":\"And then he, so it was like 76 is when he started the summer of 76.\"},{\"currTime\":3533,\"text\":\"And then I think that it went on for two years in Sacramento, then he went to the East Bay\"},{\"currTime\":3539,\"text\":\"and then somewhere, but I think he went down further, Visalia, cause they think that's\"},{\"currTime\":3544,\"text\":\"where he started.\"},{\"currTime\":3545,\"text\":\"They call them the Visalia ransacker, which is like, um, central night stalker though.\"},{\"currTime\":3551,\"text\":\"I know they, because it was pre, I think it's cause yeah, it was, but, um, it was like,\"},{\"currTime\":3558,\"text\":\"that's really what he was doing.\"},{\"currTime\":3560,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":3561,\"text\":\"Cause he would go and scope it out beforehand, but he just wasn't famous and he basically\"},{\"currTime\":3565,\"text\":\"kind of disappeared.\"},{\"currTime\":3566,\"text\":\"Then when those other, the, those same MMO murders, rapes and murders were happening\"},{\"currTime\":3572,\"text\":\"down here, that's when they finally put it together.\"},{\"currTime\":3575,\"text\":\"And there was finally like, they say that that case in the seventies is why they started\"},{\"currTime\":3580,\"text\":\"developing the DNA database in California because they were going so crazy about not\"},{\"currTime\":3586,\"text\":\"being able to find him.\"},{\"currTime\":3587,\"text\":\"So they could all link them together.\"},{\"currTime\":3588,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":3589,\"text\":\"I think it happened.\"},{\"currTime\":3590,\"text\":\"It happened in Irvine in like the early eighties.\"},{\"currTime\":3591,\"text\":\"I think when I lived there, when I was a baby, and he's still around to, he could potentially\"},{\"currTime\":3597,\"text\":\"still murder.\"},{\"currTime\":3598,\"text\":\"Is he still killing or not that anybody knows, not in that way.\"},{\"currTime\":3603,\"text\":\"Not like he, you know, he would tie people up with very special knots.\"},{\"currTime\":3606,\"text\":\"But Michelle, um, McNamara wrote these amazing

because I, we, I just want to know, I want the problem solved\"},{\"currTime\":3635,\"text\":\"like I want the, what's the, what's the answer to the riddle?\"},{\"currTime\":3638,\"text\":\"And you

to it.\"},{\"currTime\":3650,\"text\":\"And you hope that that doesn't happen anymore.\"},{\"currTime\":3652,\"text\":\"But right.\"},{\"currTime\":3653,\"text\":\"Cause this was back in the seventies

    "transcript_text": " This is exactly right. We at Wondery live, breathe, and downright obsess over true crime. And now we're launching the ultimate true crime fan experience, Exhibit C. Join now by following Wondery, Exhibit C, on Facebook and listen to true crime on Wondery and Amazon Music. Exhibit C, it's truly criminal. My favorite. Good morning. Karen. It's really happening. It's really happening. Hey, hard start. Just go to sleep. Let's just relax into what we're about to do, which is our new podcast, My Favorite Murder. Let's get cozy and comfy and cuddle up and talk about murder. Talk about the thing that makes you feel most romantic. Murder. We got a fire lit. We're having some hot cocoa. I'm swirling a brandy around over my head. No, I love this topic. I do too. And that's why we're friends. Yeah. We've talked about this for a long time about true crime and what our favorite ones are, because that sounds creepy, but. That's who we are. That's fine. I feel like we were at a party and something along this topic came up and that's how you and I were both like, like shoulder grab moment. I remember which one it was. What was it? It was the staircase. Yes. Everyone's favorite, wasn't it? Oh yeah. And because we were at a party and a girl we were there with, Erin Dewey Lennox, she has a photo from prom of herself on that staircase. No. You're shaking your head now. No, I'm just freaking out. I didn't see that. Did I? I thought you did. Are you talking about Matt's Halloween party last year? Yeah. I didn't see that. Oh my God. So she was friends with that family in high school. Holy. Like before it happened, there was prom. She went to prom with the daughter, her friend, photo of them in their prom dresses on the staircase of the staircase of the staircase story. Unbelievable. I know. What does she think? What's her opinion? I think she thinks a bird did it, which I think is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. The owl theory? Yeah. No. Right? That is made up as hell. Everyone watched the staircase and then laughed along with us at the owl story. You know what's funny is I just recommended my sister's best friend, Adrienne, who's basically like my other sister I grew up with. I told her we were going to do this and the second I said it, and I did not know this about her. I've known her since I was 12. Oh my God. I love it. She goes, oh, well, it has to be Night Sucker first and I was like, wait, I didn't realize you had an opinion about this. She's like, oh my God. I love serial killers. I was like, what? I was like, she was always the prissy girl and like the, or I mean, not prissy, but just I, you know, I just thought it was so weird and perverted all my life for loving this topic so much. You can't tell anyone because they're going to think you're psychotic or like, like into murder, which are not, you're just like fascinated by the idea, the whole concept. So that was awesome. And then I said, you have to watch this series. You'll freak out. Yeah. And she's been texting me updates as she's watching it, like, can't believe it. Just all emojis. So basically, yeah, go watch it, but this, this chick's husband fucking killed her because she found out that he was having like a child molester or something, right? No, no, no. He was having a fair, he was like paying for male prostitutes. And she found out like right before he murdered her. I mean, that the owl playing into that makes it seem more unlikely when you know about the male prostitutes. It does, it throws a, what do you call wrench in the works a little bit, throws an owl, it throws a male prostitute into the thing. It throws a live owl into the works. It's so crazy. But, but I understand there, you know, there's people making argument that like he got railroaded because of the male prostitute thing and painted a picture of him that wasn't real or whatever. But I, that's still bullshit because you can still kill your wife and be railroaded and bat. Yeah, Southern people be biased against you because you're secretly Southern people aren't the tolerant, the Southern and I'll be intolerant by saying all Southern people are intolerant. But it's absolutely true across the board. There you go. That's what we're about big, big facts and truths. So stop listening now if you can't handle the truth and facts or spoilers like the guy killed his wife on the stairs like it's not a mystery. I don't think I don't think a spoiler is ever the guy killed his wife because that's like, yeah, the guy killed his wife. Yeah. Spoiler is that an owl did it. That's exactly right. Good point. So we're going to, so this is, are we, we're calling this my favorite murder? Are we recording? So do you want to start with this? Is this what we're, should we start my favorite murder and it's going to be real fucked up and Dustin brought up a great point that we might be inviting a murderer into our lives by doing this. I mean, but here's the thing and this is why I'm so fascinated by this topic in general. We might already know a murderer. Oh my God, like probably. Probably and in that way where they're just in a very cat-like removed Dexter way, just observing all this for the kind of, oh, they think they're, they think they're cute. Isn't that cute? Yeah. Isn't that cute than quaint? Yeah. So I guess the disclaimers really don't kill us because we can't do this podcast anymore if you can. I mean, and another part of that disclaimer could be partly like we kind of are fans, a lot of murdering people, like we're your friends, we're, we, what it is, is I, I think what you're doing is wrong. I wish you'd stop it. Yeah. But you probably knew too. You do too. We know we've seen the specials where you talk about wanting to stop and not being able to stop. Definitely. But at the same time, like the level of planning, I mean, I got here 15 minutes late and this is something I want to do. Like their, their, their shit is together, those serial killers. So the thought of like for me, it's like you got away with it for like the thought of getting away with something like that is insane. And the fact that like the rest of your life are you, you're either worrying constantly that you're going to get caught or you're a sociopath and you just don't worry about that shit. Yeah. Which would not be great. Oh my God. It would be so great. I mean, right now I have, I'm pretty sure I have two unpaid parking tickets. So I live in constant. Will I get the third and a boot in front of people I know it's constant. And it's tearing me apart. Yeah. And it'd be great. The only thing you have to worry about is getting caught for murder, for murdering many people that part their hair down the middle or whatever your preference is. Ted Bundy. Am I right girl? Did I just spoil your favorite murder? Don't tell me. No, no, no. So like, you know, what you did was pick up on the reference I was dropping like an expert. Oh, I fucking got this. This is why I reference this because we love murder. And the one time I was stoned at a party and decided to tell people one of the worst things I've ever seen. I made people blanch and walk away from our, from our circle and Georgia moved closer with the white eye. She has right now going, oh my God, this is amazing. It's when I, I don't know why I did it. I do. This is part of my problem. Oh my God. Tell me I love it. It was when, I think it was at that same party. Yeah. Somebody asked me what had been going on lately and it was right after I got back from South by Southwest or not right after for some reason the South by Southwest, the car accident came up and my big brag, which never pans out as a brag. I always think it is like how fascinating about me and no one ever agrees is that I was there when it happened and I didn't see it. My back was to it. I heard it. Tell everyone what it was. Oh, sorry. Um, in at South by Southwest two years ago, a guy was in a police chase and he turned up a street that was cordoned off, um, for people to mill about cause it was a festival. And so all the people standing in the street in front of the theater where X was playing got plowed down. Old punk rockers. Yeah. And I had been standing last in line to get in. So I would have been the first person hit, but I decided to walk away. Good for you. I mean, like, fuck this shit. I'm over it. Yeah. Cause you know me in lines and waiting and how I don't go anywhere or do anything. So I walked away to see my friend at the front, like, Hey, let's just stand out here and listen to the music. The car comes, people fly like cardboard boxes. I tell this story in groups of people and people are literally like bumming out hard. And I had just read about it that afternoon and I was like, Oh, tell me everything. Cause that's my like car accidents are another thing. I've had two ex-boyfriends and my, and one best friend dying car accidents. What? Yeah. What? Yeah. I've had two ex-boyfriends at the time, but they were important ones, you know, from like high school, died in car accidents. One my best friend from high school died in car accident. Don't trick and drive you guys. That's horrible. I know. So like, I'm just fucking want to hear all about it. And I'm also, I'm also big in like anything could happen at any moment. You'll never know about it. Like I don't sit near a window at a restaurant because I am like a car is going to come creaning through the fucking window and kill me. Sure. So that's just to me is like, tell me everything so I can avoid it. Yes. That's what, that's what all this is really. I just want to collect information and hear theories and stories so that I can be braced so that when I see the weird, you know, that the one thing's out of the knife, I'm ready. Totally. Like why is there an open soda can? Yes. I didn't open that. I didn't. Well, I don't drink Pepsi light. No. And also I feel like a lot of physics is that like the more you know about something, the less likely it's going to happen to you. Yes. You know what I mean? Sure. Absolutely. It's not science. It's not scientific. It's spiritual. Okay. It's more of, um, it's the secret river in reverse. Get it away from me. My secret hope is to not get murdered. Yeah. Yeah. My secret hope is to murder the woman who wrote the secret. That's a great, that's a great, that's beautiful. I'm doing it for everybody. So should we, we want to start with a news story? Yeah. That's a true crime news story. Yeah. What's yours? I'm obsessed and I actually realized I need to stop talking about it because people who don't wouldn't like it are going to hate it the most. Oh my God. I'm so excited. But, and you probably know about it. It's the first thing I wanted to say to you, and I walked in here, um, on Halloween morning. No. Was it Halloween morning or the day before? I can't remember. Is it the car accident guy? Yes. Guys. Most fucked up thing. So it's 7 a.m., it's traffic, it's the five, do you know if they were going north or south? I think they were going, um, north. I was picturing north in my mind. Yeah. Because they're going towards the 134 and about to hit Colorado. Oh yes. Okay. So that's more. So this is like 10 minutes from my house, our house right now. Moments away from my house. Yeah. Yeah. That's the free way I'm on all the time. Right. So. It's not Friday morning. Guys. On his way. Rush hour. Well, nobody really knows because he was 20. The adults can't have jobs, but many don't. Yeah. No. Um, he was driving really fast and weaving in and out of traffic, driving on the shoulder. He was a dick. He was a dick. Driving crazy. Yeah. And then he hit something, flipped his car, was shot out through the windshield. And here's the craziest part. It wasn't wearing a seatbelt. Well, it was a fucking idiot. Yeah. Of course. So he was severed. Inhale. He was severed and I didn't know that part. Oh shit. Uh, yeah. He was severed in half and the top half of his body landed on the Colorado exit sign off of the freeway. 20 feet up. Oh, I think higher than that is that how he flew and then, and then landed on a fucking sign, like the platform. Yes. Like on the tiny walkway on the sign. So imagine then you're driving to work at the fucking Disney building off the 134. It's Friday, I'm going to be like a slutty lover. Should I take Kala around it? Yeah. And then there's a, the top half of a guy's body hanging off the exit. Ways is like, uh, top half of body noted in the freeway ahead of. Thanks. Oh boy. Boop off. Like let's change routes. I can't. I'm so obsessed with it. I had to call my sister and she already know it, of course. She does. She's like me. Um, but she didn't know the severed thing either. And then we thought about whether or not it was the top or bottom half based on the accident. Was his body still bottom half still in the car? That's what I imagine. Are just screaming over the top of their lungs right now to like avoid listening to this. Yeah. They're not going to stop listening. Cause come on. I mean, why would, if you're not into this, then this is a good litmus test for what's happening. Um, I always like, have you ever seen a dead body? No. I mean, funeral. Yeah. Okay. Not naturally the way I've always dreamed of as a child, like finding one like in a ravine. Oh yeah. Yeah. That girl who like, uh, found a body. Yep. Then I'm the one getting hugged by cops, even though I didn't have nothing to do with it. But suddenly I'm the hero. You get a free, uh, marathon, uh, like what are those tin foil blankets that they put over you? You got a free one. I wasn't even cold. This is the best. Oh, every word. Terrible people. This is like, we're just showing our humanity right now. You know, here's the thing. It's probably anxiety. Oh, it's definitely anxiety. It's, uh, I don't know, but also it's because I was raised, it's very strictly Catholic where you weren't supposed to talk about stuff like this. So like, I still remember the first time I opened a true crime book and saw they had a diagram of how drama, Gacy buried bodies in the house. And it was one of those moments where I was like, wow, wow, wow, like everything changed in my brain. It's all real. Yeah. I was, I just remember, I feel like being raised in the 80s, like kids were fucking disappearing and being found dead, like on the regular. Every song I listened to in the 80s reminds me of like whatever dead kid was like missing that time. Totally. And actually my, my story is, um, my truth, my current story is because of a kid in 1989, Jacob Wetterling, there's, it was a cold case. He just disappeared. This dude, like in a mask, it's his little brother and him and a friend riding bikes to get a video on a fucking afternoon in 1989. What movie were they getting? Don't tell mom, the babysitter said like probably right. And I probably saw the same one. The sky makes them get, has a gun and a mask on, makes them lay down in a ravine, asks them their ages, which is fucked up and then has the other two run off into the woods. How bad does this kid feel that he left his brother behind? Oh, please. I never found, but this guy that, um, that's, that's terrible, you know, and they found all the child porn in this guy's house and they think one of the kids is the kid who disappeared. So they think he fucking, this did it. And my computer is not working. Okay. Um, yeah, they uncovered dozens of VHS tapes of this, of fucking child porn and of this guy, like hiding in bushes and like following them on their paper routes and shit like that. No. Yeah. Sorry, but was the kid that had disappeared in the child? They think so. Yeah. I don't know. I know. It's as horrible as, you know, the guy that kind of kicked it all off, um, the, well, for me, cause I think it was in this, the San Francisco area, that guy, John, what's his name, whose son was taken, um, this is lame. No, we can know all the names, but it's, uh, he's, he has, oh, John Walsh. Yes. Oh my God. So treasure. He was like kind of the first big one, the New York one was Ethan, that little boy that tried to walk to school one day. But do you know that John Walsh had to listen to tapes? They would find, like find evidence and then they would give it to him. And if he wanted to, he could listen to it, like of kids being murdered so that he would know whether or not it was his son throw up, right? Are you fucking kidding me? Yeah. He had to, he listened to a whole tape that wasn't his son of another kid getting tortured. Oh my God, it's the, I mean, I feel like it really is the worst child killers and rapists are, that's the devil on walking earth. Yeah. I mean, that's real. It's so insane. I can't even imagine. I can't imagine. And I do it constantly and I know that when I have kids, I'm going to be the fucking worst parent. Oh yeah. And I'm going to have kids too. They've made us have, have to have multiple kids because one of them could get murdered and then you don't have any children. When I read, when I hear like a crime thing and I'm like, Oh, it's our only child. That sucks. You should have had a backup. Have at least four because you just don't know. You need two normals, two alternates. Oh, love one the best and like protect them the most because like, although, but don't show it. Do not show it. Right. Cause there's people everywhere. Maybe one of those kids will become a killer. Oh yeah. If you're too crazy about it, you actually cause it. Sure. That's so terrible. And that poor, yeah, you're right. I also love to think about aftermath, like, like those two little boys lives are ruined. I mean, they're just, that's it. Yeah. That's, that's you're done for. Totally. It reminds me of, remember the kid that got kidnapped and then he came back. I know my name is Kevin. Oh, the one that wasn't really him. No, no, it was him. He came back because the guy that had kidnapped him and kept him as like a sex slave for years got another little boy. Right. Remember that? And then he finally, cause he had of course been brainwashed that like, I killed your parents. But he lived and he would go online and to his like, his website of like find Kevin or whatever and be like, you guys don't really want to find him probably like put message on the message board, like testing them almost. And I think that the guy even like, let him out and like hang out with the neighborhood kids. Like, yes, that's right. He was so brainwashed. He was so brainwashed and he thought, I mean, like he thought his family either was dead or didn't care. Yeah. Like for example, Stainer is the last name because then his brother, his brother became a serial killer. No, we didn't. Yes. What? Corey Stainer is the guy that killed. I mean, I guess that's not serial. They say serial killer is two or more people. Right. But like a viral video. Like, how do you know it's viral? There's no like number. It's the same with serial killer. It's just like how many cats are there and how much do people like it? He killed a woman and her daughter and her daughter's friend in Yosemite. That was him. Yes. I remember that story. Those girls, those poor beheaded them and like, and then he made a statement like, I just need people to know I did not rape them before I killed them. Oh, great. Thank you. I wait until after. I mean, you know, thank you. But yeah. You know what? It almost scares me. This is so silly, but it almost scares me more when they don't rape them because like if you're just like sexually fucked up and you want to get boned and then you kill someone to do that, but just to kill them to kill them is also, oh my God, I'm not saying one is better than the other. No, no, no. We can't choose. Clearly. We feel a fight for this podcast. You know that? This is the end of our careers as we know it really might be. Like if we think this is so casual and people like they were making fun of, they called a guy a fucking idiot who didn't put a seatbelt on in a car. I didn't mean to call him a fucking idiot. Look, where your seatbelt? That's what everyone's been saying. Every time I've told us that story multiple times and that's what everyone said. But like if he had a seatbelt on and he wasn't driving insane, then it would just be tragic and sad. Exactly. But because. Also. Yeah. We'll just LA car culture. It's hard to forgive. Yeah. You know, you drive with those people that weave in and out and drive on the shoulder and. I've been, I've been driven off the road and a guy came to my window screaming at me. I have it on video and the only reason I don't think he broke my window open and murdered me is because I was videotaping him. Yeah. No, it's tough here. It's tough here. So keep us in context. We're just, we're living the life. We're trying. Listen, we both have really bad anxiety. I just want everyone should know that we're like, I hope that's clear. I hope it's clear that we're clinically anxious people. I. All the meds, it doesn't work. This is me at like a baseline, like medicated. I'm doing okay. Anxiety. I just don't leave my house almost ever. Right. You're two ferocious dogs. Dogs that guard the door and we just stay indoors all the time. It's a secret. Everything's locked. Windows are locked and closed. I don't know how you live. I shouldn't say this actually. How I live in that house on the first floor. Well, that's my huge, a huge, it's scary, but those dogs, that's why I got those dogs. That's true. That's true. I live for a couple months without those dogs and every night I would just lay in my bed. Like I would hear things. It was crazy. Yeah. Cause also the quieter it is, the worse it is. Cause then you're just like, then your brain is, is telling you your hearing things. It was nuts. And I was finally like, just get a look at it. Yeah. Yeah. Good for you. Thank you. Yeah. I'm a hero. I always have a boyfriend. No, that's not why. Also cause I don't, I have a seizure when I was a kid once and I don't want to sleep alone anymore. Oh, tell me about it. Also I love Vince, but also it's nice to not get murdered. Also I love Vince comes third. The murder is important though because you have to live to be able to love him. But here's the thing. He murders me. I mean, You gotta think about your husband. Here's what I'm telling you. The book I write will do you proud. Thank you so much. I will be the an rule. I'll be like, guys, I was there the whole time. I knew. You would never have known he wanted to murder her. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is the best. Still waters. You're like, that guy's the best. Which one's still waters? Just I'm saying people that are like, you would have never known that they had murder in them. Oh, that's the name of the book. Still waters around deep. Yeah. Yeah. No story. Okay. Should we tell? Okay. So then we'll tell each other our favorite murders. And then, okay, we, here's what we want. If you guys stop listening during the murder part because you hate us before you do that, listen to this. Um, I, we're obsessed with people's like hometown murder, kidnapping, fucked up, crazy stories. Yeah. I have always asked people at bars and they stopped talking to me because I want to know they're like, what was the crazy thing that happened in your town? Um, and I think they can't handle that level of conversations. Better. You're not talking to them. I completely agree. Get out. Uh, and I don't have one really. One of those stories. Cause you're from LA. I'm from Orange County. Nothing bad happens there. No, there's some shit. So we want you to email us. You can email me at Georgia hard stark at Gmail. All right. Your town story, but, but don't say like, here's the town story. Put a link in it. I want, we want in your own voice. Like, so this fucking thing happened and I was this year's old and my mom wouldn't let me and then we used to go to the house and throw rocks at it. Here's what happened. Does that happen? Totally. Did you do that? Yep. You have a goal. We'll see. We can go then talk about poly class. Yeah. I mean that one. Yeah. That one's rough because it's so famous and the town was so small. That's crazy. I'm from Petaluma where the little girl poly class got taken out of her bedroom by a man while she was having a slumber party. Multiple people were there. Yeah. Multiple little girls. Why did he do it then? Does, do we know? There was, there were lots of theories that the dad had like bad debts or was involved in drugs. No. But that's kind of, of course, small town gossip. That's extreme too. It's crazy and also this guy was a total like Charles Manson in and out of jail all his life. Keep them in jail. Come on. That's another problem we have. It's simple. It's so simple. Like, rapists get three to five years. Stop doing that. That's so insane. It's insane. You know, we're going to do a lot of good on this vlog. I feel like we're going to change laws. We're going to be advocates, victims, advocates. Mariska Hargitay is going to guest spot on it one time. She's going to, she's going to deliver our speech. No, I don't know what I'm saying. She's going to give us our medal. At the podcast awards. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, listen, there are lots of rape kits that are backlogged thousands and thousands. Let's get those rape kits tested. Hey guys. Hey guys. Let's get those rape kits. There's like a, there's like a loosely closed door and on the other side of, and it called a rape kit. And on the other side of that door is the person who did it. And probably other bad things that you might want to know about. Probably. I mean, I don't want to sound this condescending tops, but in the privacy of Georgia's home, I'm not afraid to get, oh, we're just going to be, we're going to be murdered by, and everyone's going to be like, those fucking idiots didn't wear a seatbelt on their podcast and deserve that. They're so stupid. You know what? What a way to go though. Taffa torso up on the Colorado exit sign. Bring it on. It's pretty badass. What if you were driving and saw that? What if you saw that on your way to work? You would go home. Yeah. You would get to go home. You got to go home that day. Because I saw the picture and this second I saw the picture for this news story, I was like, this is a prank. There's no way. But they had, but they had put a, a, someone had climbed up there and put a towel over it. Yeah. And how did that, so hopefully there's no pictures before that, are there? I think there, well there, the one I saw was from the, across the freeway. It's really far away. So you just see like the basic shape and colors. You don't see anything specific at all. Oh, what a bummer. I hope he was dead before he, well, he got, I didn't realize the part of getting torn in half. Yeah. But like sometimes they say, if you get beheaded, you're, you're still conscious for like seven seconds. Fun. I don't know. I mean. That sounds cool. Look, I'm scared of dying. So I love, all of this makes me feel better. Me too. Listen, this is the root of it all is that we're terrified of dying. Yeah. Yeah. What a bummer. And dying in a weird way. Yeah. Like in a, or a sneaky way. Like the other night there was, I, I, God, it was, I wasn't talking to you on the phone was I, there was one night where I was talking to somebody and I was like, it's raining. And they were like, what are you talking about? It's not, it's not going to rain for years and years. And I was like, no, there's, and then there's a sound on the roof of my house. And it was like tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. It's raining murderers. Yes. We get, well, I'll bring that up later. But anyway. Oh my God. It's a constant awareness. Oh, I always know how I'm going to die in any room I'm in, in any situation, in any room I'm in, I'm aware of how everyone in that room, how we're all going to die. And so I am the one who's all, who's on edge and aware of it at all times. Yeah. Well, that's good. That's not healthy. Yeah. Or does it keep you alive? That's true. You know how many weapons I have on my fucking keychain too? I have two keychains, two weapons. What are they? One is pepper spray. Good. And the other was one of that, that cool little cat, pointy ear cat thing that you, you hook your fingers through and you can poke and you stab people in the eye with the cat ears. Oh, nice. It's fun and cool. It's like the cat ear defense keychain. Look it up. It's, get it. Okay. I will. Yeah. I like that. I want my roommate used to have pepper. She had pepper corns, pepper spray on her. She had pepper corns on her keychain and I drove her car to the Burbank airport one time to pick her up and this was pre 9 11. So I was walking to the gate to meet her. Remember those days? And I went through security through the, the keychain in the bowl. Like the security guy looks at it. He's like, ma'am, can you step over here? And I'm like, what? And then he calls over like the official cop Burbank police and he's like, man, there's a weapon. You have this Burbank, this pepper spray, you know, this is illegal or whatever. And I got so angry cause my roommate drove me crazy anyway. And she was totally the kind of person that would be like, I have an illegal weapon on my keychain and not tell you. And so I just started yelling at this cop. I was like, it's my roommate's car. I was so mad and he freaked him out. Like he kind of started laughing and then he's like, all right, he's like, we're going to keep it. I'm like, good, keep it. You know what? I always forget that I carry around in my purse when I get on the airport is like fucking switchblade comb. Oh, shit. And they're like, uh, you can't throw it away. I've like thrown away so many of those. That's so rock of the way of you to think switchblade combs are funny. I think they're funny. And I also love the fact that like, I think the bottom of your purse is so disgusting and like crumbs of shit that like I don't want an open comb laying out there. So switchblade. Oh, like that's smart. I don't like murderers and I don't like gross stuff. I don't like crumbs. I don't like cookie crumbs in my hair. It's the whole range. Just everything. Yay. Uh, should we go? Should we do my favorite murder? Yes. You want to go first? Sure. I think this is an obvious one. So like, yeah, hey, I'm Mike Corey, the host of wonder is podcast against the odds in our next season, three mask men hijack a school bus full of children in the sleepy farm town of Chowchilla, California. They bury the children and their bus driver deep underground planning to hold them for ransom. Local police and the FBI marshal a search effort, but the trail quickly runs dry as the air supply for the trapped children dwindles, a pair of unlikely heroes emerges. Follow against the odds wherever you get your podcasts. You can listen ad free on the Amazon Music or Wondery app. What do we eat? Okay. My favorite. Your official voice. I'm really excited. You know what? Let's get real. I mean, we're like, we're just going to do every week our favorite murder, like a murder story we love. Yeah. And I had, so I had to start like a good one because it's, and it's new. I'm newly interested in this. My what? I was just going to say one thing. We know other people love this as much as we do. So if we mess up information, don't be afraid to tell us because I understand, like when I hear people talking about something, it drives me crazy if I know the real thing because it is my passion, but I also am very an inaccurate and messy person. So if I get it wrong and you want to tell us, please do and we'll talk about it. I appreciate that. Cause I'm so nervous about getting any of this wrong that I'm going to give less information than I like would think I have. And also get, tell us more information that you know, or like cool things that you know about it. Totally. And then at the end of the episodes, we should just like read listener mail of like, I think that's a great idea. How about we have a whole segment that's like corrections, how about we have like a supplement to our podcast of just corrections every week because I, I, my passion is for the act and for specific stories within it, but like, I'll always get the numbers wrong or the years wrong. My, my passion is for the insanity of it and the fact that this thing stuff happens. Yeah. So tell us when we're wrong. Just jump into this. Obviously though. Yeah. You don't have to get on your high horse about it. Just calm down. Yeah. Okay. Now that we've got that out of the way, um, my favorite murder is that of Jean Benet Ramsey. Oh, classic. Which I used to think was stupid and boring until I listened to last podcast on the left's two part in depth discussion of it. Yes. And I was like, Oh, this is way more fascinating than I remember. Yes. I love that podcast. You turned me on to it. And you turned me on to it because of those episodes, which I immediately listened to. And those guys are so on it with all of their research. Yeah. Very thorough. We are not. We're not going to do that. So, no. Um, everyone knows it. Basically a six year old girl was murdered in her home in Boulder, Colorado in 1996. She was a, um, beauty queen, which I think kind of, I think just kind of sullies the whole thing because it's really just a little girl and the beauty pageant stuff has nothing to do with it. Right, except for you could stop right there and still have a real good horror story because she's a six year old girl. They're babies. Children. I was telling you that that I was looking at a picture of her and then remembered that she's six, like one year older than five. And she looks like she's 10. She does. It's, it's dirty. The whole thing is the creepiest. And she has, she looks smarter than she looks a little knowing, which is fucked up. And I feel like the, I feel like the beauty pageant thing was a big deal because it kind of, because it was never solved this crime, which I don't think it's true. I think her father killed her, which we'll get into. But the fact that it's like, well, maybe a child molester did it because I feel like that kind of made it seem that way, but because she's dressed up woman basically as a child and maybe she was, she was murdered by a child molester or fan or something. Right. And I think she was, it just happened to be her father who was that person. Right. Like that became the red herring that really is such a heart. You can't ignore a red herring like that because it's the thing itself is so creepy. Yeah. It's like being in a cult, being in child pageants. Right. Definitely. It's like the Satan scare of the 80s when they thought everyone was, all these kids were Satanists. Yeah. But really God and Satan don't exist. So that's impossible. Wait, wait. What? Oh, I'm sorry. Well, you should have told me that before. That's what I get killed for is for saying that it's not for. So many reasons to be killed. This is what this podcast is going to be about. What are they going to get killed about? Killed list. So then, yeah. So I think that the dad did it. He, there's like a lot of weird things about it. The ransom letter is three pages, which is the longest ransom letter in murder history. That's the thing that I'm going to get corrected about probably, but it's two pages. And it was written on there on the notepad in the Ramsey house with their pens. So the killer did this and then wrote a three page ransom note, just chilled the fuck out and wrote a note. Yeah. Like who would do that? Right. And she was already dead in the basement from blunt force trauma. She had blunt force trauma to her head, which would have killed her, but she was then strangled, which is what ended up killing her for real. It's just so fucked up. Who have you? And the ransom note is incredible. Also the fact that there are children playing out in your alley right now, so we can hear her screaming. I don't know if you can hear that in the background for that moment. It's the perfect background. No, it's perfect. It's good. Okay. It just was, I was like, why am I so uncomfortable right now? And I'm like, cause there's a child screaming is somewhere. Oh, it's all so wrong. It's so upset. Go listen to the, I know you hate this, but listen to the 911 call. I can't do it. Is it Patsy? It's Patsy freaking the fuck out, but, but the wording in her call and if you like, listen to it and listen to the interpretation, like she's saying everything wrong. She's not like, she's not saying. My daughter is missing. She's saying we have a kidnapping. Like she's not taking personal responsibility for what's like, for what is happening to her or her daughter. She's kind of making it more generalized. She's setting up a story. It sounds like. Yeah. And there's all these interpretations people say about like, you know, um, not asking for help. They're saying for the, her daughter, she's like begging for someone to, to deal with it instead of asking for help for her daughter. Yeah. And then there's like, people say that, um, one of the ways you know they're lying is because that they said that their son, who was like 10 was asleep upstairs until like after the police had got there. But in the background with analysis, with the 911 call, you can hear his voice. Oh yeah. And there's just all these little things. Oh, so it could be like some family event took place and this was like the cleanup version. Well another weird thing is that they're, so they found pineapple during the autopsy in her stomach that she had eaten before she died because it hadn't been digested. And there, and there was a bowl of pineapple with a spoon in it on the table and the son's fingerprints were on the bowl. But the parents said that they put her right to bed when they got home from a Christmas party that night. That's the thing that happened on Christmas Eve or Christmas. Yeah. Christmas Eve. Yeah. Yeah. Cause that's why there was no good cops. Right. All the good cops were at home. All the good cops weren't living in Boulder, Colorado. Right. And that's the reason I'm going to get killed right there. Yeah. And then, okay, the other weird thing in the ransom note, the killer, okay, so they're, these people are billionaires. Yeah. And the killer asked for, for the ransom, they made it look like a kidnapping, which is why they were the ransom note. They asked for $118,000 as the ransom, which like poor people, like that's a lot of money. It's not a lot of money, but also that's a very specific amount. And it's also the amount that John Ramsey had been given as a Christmas bonus that year. Do you think they were trying to set it up to make it look like someone knew that and there? That's why it was such a specific number? Yes. Like they were trying to lead people away from themselves. Yes, definitely. Wow. Well, the whole note does that too. And then, but the other weird thing I think we talked about this is that when they were doing sample handwritings of the mom and dad. So Patsy Ramsey was the mother was, was how to rewrite the note. And instead of writing $118,000 numerically, she wrote out $118,000, like who the fuck does that? Like that's so stupid. Obviously, you're trying to mask something unless she loves calligraphy. And that's her thing. Well, they, they basically a bunch of handwriting analysis said that it's her handwriting really without it out. Really? Yeah. But then I've read other stuff that it's his as well. It's, even then though, if it's like some kind of in family murder, whoever wrote the note doesn't mean that's the killer. Exactly. It's just that they're, it's collusion. Exactly. Is that the right way to use that word? Collusion? Yeah. Well, well, let us know. Tell us. Correct us. I'm going to throw out stuff like that because it feels good in my brain. It felt good. When you said it, I was like, yeah, she's right. That's collusion, God damn it. And they're like, that's actually a rare alcohol from Fiji. I'll have the collusion on the rocks. I just love the story because I'm so, I'm equally convinced that it's one of the parents that it's both of the parents that it's the son, but I don't think it's anyone outside the family. Now, what's the deal with the son? So the son was like, I think he was 10. He had hit her with a golf club in the past in the face, but it was an accident supposedly. People all over the, you know, I don't know if you know this, but people on the internet have theories and talk about them. So people's theories are that it was him, he hit her over the head with like a golf club or something, which is because she has blunt force trauma from being hit with something. So then maybe she was dying and one of the parents killed her to make and then set it up to make it look like a kidnapping and a murder so that the son wouldn't get in trouble for it. But I mean, talk about picking a favorite child. Yeah. That's a little, he never got, he didn't get spoken to by the police for a month and when he did, it was like quick, nothing. Right. But he's so young. I don't know. I remember reading that they, after the first night where the cops had never been cops before showed up to not secure the scene, then whatever they talked to them about that night, they, the Patsy and John, right, John, they also weren't interviewed for a month. They had so much time to rehearse what their story would be and lock it all down. I mean, just the fact that like they had searched the house multiple times over and finally were like sent John, the father to go search the house just to give him something to do. And he goes into the secret wine room off the weird basement and happens to find her after eight hours of the cops having had been there, grabs her body, takes the tape off of her mouth and brings her upstairs, thus ruining any DNA evidence that you could have used. Yeah. And then, and then Patsy throws herself on the body. She did. Yeah. So the DNA shit is just fucked. I mean, that's all guilty hindsight kind of wonder though, like, I don't know. Would you well, hard to say, I don't think I would throw myself onto the body of a dead child. No, no. I mean, I don't try it hard to say. Let's reenact this. Let's have a child and let's have it murder six years from now. I just can't the idea of like a real quick problem solve. Okay. Junior messed up again. This guy always will be boys. I'm going to strangle her to death. Yeah. Yeah. It's so much. It's such a, it's such an over solve. It's a big from A to B. Plus wouldn't you want your, your fucking psycho path kid who ruined your like prized, killed your prized daughter to get in trouble for that? Right. People don't. I don't know. I mean. I mean, that's where that theory falls apart for me. Yeah. She is clearly the prize pony. Right. Which is why maybe he wanted to kill her. Of course. But then, so I see them covering, I see them covering like note wise and bad, bad 911 call wise and all that. Just not killing her. But not the killing. Maybe she, they didn't know she wasn't dead yet. So they put that over her. No, she was breathing. I don't know. I mean, we're not going to solve it tonight. Are we? Oh, I thought that's what this podcast was. I mean, let's not even talk about the underwear she had on, the weird underwear she had on. That they found DNA on it that didn't match the family. It was not the brother's DNA. No. That she was sexually assaulted, but they also said that it looked like it was, it had been, you know, over a period of time. It wasn't even like that night she was sexually assaulted. It was like, this is something that's been happening for a long time. I mean. Yeah. See, I feel like that's not the, that is going to be a pretty common denominator when you're talking about these child beauty claims that some gross dude wants to fuck them. Yes. They have full makeup on and high heels shoes. Have you watched? I watched like one episode. I was probably high, which was a problem. Yeah. That's a real bad idea. That's such a bad idea. And these girls, I was, yeah, I was, I scream at the TV when I'm high. Of course. And I was just yelling about that they look like, they look like playboy playmates. They are supposed to. And also the thing you said earlier, which is the, you know, I think the reason she was such a champion, that knowing look, like she had that weird, beyond her years wisdom. That's super creepy in children. I don't even have that. I mean, look, I have it, but I earned it. I mean, and I don't wear a weird tiara and hot pink lips. We have it, but we're broken people. We're, yes. We, it suits our faces. We earned it. Oh, the things I've seen for years. Look away. Of anxiety and not trusting people. Here's my terrible tattoo. This is my evidence. Yeah. Yeah. That's, John Donate is, you're right. I had that same thing where when it first happened, I was like, this is boring. Who cares? Like we're only seeing this because she's this beautiful little girl and it's that weird. Especially if you go online and look at a photo of her, just like there's like a photo of her opening a Christmas present that year. There's a little girl and you just forget that. And I think the what's most fascinating to me about it is that it's never going to get solved. Right. The mom. Patsy's dead. Oh, do you know who the dad remarried? Do you know who John Ramsey remarried? Yes, I do. What's her name? Um, the mom girl who disappeared in, oh, this is not good. This is, this is grandma time. Someone help us in Cava. What was her name? Jessica. Uh, what's her name? Vander Sleut is the guy that killed her. Yeah. John Ramsey. This is real time. You guys. Guys, this is how computing works. Has anyone seen Steve Jobs? What a film. I'm just killing time while you do that. Anyways, the guy, Jordan Vander Sleut killed the sweet, innocent blonde. I always want to say Casey. Casey Anthony killed Casey Anthony. Are we wrong? Correct. Are we, where's the wrong part? I don't know. Anyways, they're married now. That's that. I mean, so it's just two tragedy parents. Yeah. Talk about over dinner. Oh God. You know what? There's a lot of wine. I'll tell you that. There's wine and pills for everybody. I mean, why wouldn't you? But here's the one thing that I thought was fascinating. So John Mark Carr is that guy that fake admitted to killing John Bonnet and got expedited back to America because he was in the Philippines and immediately my phone rang because my sister and Adrienne are the know everything and they think he got extradited because he was going to get brought up on child molestation charges in the Philippines, which is apparently like way, way worse in the jail. There's horrifying. You know, my dad went to high school with a guy who was put in prison in Thailand because he was, he says he was making a documentary about drug trade and had some drugs on him and they found it, which is like, come on dude. That guy has, was there for like 20 something years, an absolutely insane person now. Yes. He lost his mind. Yeah. It's a, you don't want to go to prison in Thailand. You don't want to go to prison there. So they think that's why he did the fake confession so he can come back here. But then, did we talk about this? I don't know about this part. He is in transition to become a woman now and he has started a child sex cult called the immaculates where he uses other like younger, but not children, but like safe in the teens to, to find him child, children to be in this sex cult and everyone chill the like, why are you following this guy? Make your own sex. I don't know. I just don't get it. And also like, isn't one of the rules of sex culting like it should be a secret. Yeah. The fact that this is known is like hilarious. Yeah. He's not good at it. Clearly. And I think he's wanted by the FBI and there he's hard to catch because he looks a lot like a woman. Like, I think he's transitioning very well. Maybe through this podcast, we'll find him. Yeah. Cause I didn't know that. Keep your eyes peeled. Let's do that. I bet he's, I bet she's wearing a beret. Then we'll be lauded instead of murder, lauded murder. Whatever happens, it's going to be our destiny. We have to accept it. Yeah. I'm ready for it. It's just that kind of thing is so infuriating because remember when that spiked up and it was like, they found the murderer. What a dick. Yeah. Cause now he's just through another wrench in there. Another reason it'll never be solved. It'll never be solved and we won't know. I want to read Burke is the son's name. I want to read his tell all when the dad dies. That one's the dad dies. He'd be like, yeah, clearly my dad did it. And actually John Bonet and I mean, John Ramsey and Patsy were, they were, they were set to be indicted. For what? For like, for the child abuse that led to her murder. So I'm not saying specifically like, so something like the reason she got hurt is because it was child abuse. Maybe they didn't mean to kill her. I don't know. And the judge or whoever in it, you know, all the corrupt motherfuckers like said no. And so they got bought off. Yeah. Cause he was insanely wealthy. It's not just like rich people, but like a house you can get lost in rich, a house you could murder a child and nobody knows about it. I'm rich. That's the American dream. I mean, isn't that what we all want at the end of the day? Oh my God, we're terrible people. Secret wine room, secret wine room. Okay. So that's my favorite number one first episode. Guys, if you have any updates, seriously, the second you hear if this thing gets solved, I want to know so bad. John Ramsey contact us at a, not at our homes. Um, not at, oh, but he's, no, he's just living a normal life. I think so. With Vander Sleut's. Yeah. Victor's mother, how much better of a person is John Walsh than John Ramsey? Oh my, well, they might be opposites. Well, one might be guilty and the other might be, might have suffered the most anyone could suffer in this life. Every time I see John Walsh on TV, I want to hug him. I, I feel the same way and I try to watch him, but it's difficult to watch. I find his like, he's so gunning for justice, but it's like, this is honey, honey. You can't gun for enough justice. How many ambience does he take every night? Do you think? I mean, all of them. Every ambient. He does so much sleep driving. Oh, poor guy. Hey, Karen. Yeah. What's your favorite murder? My favorite murder. Can you write a ballad for this? Can you write like a totally, I'll do like, um, kind of a hang them high, like murder ballad about. Yes. That actually makes me, I really don't like those songs as like old appellation country song. I just had to kill her. It's always just like, well, she done me wrong. I just had to hang her high or it's like, you think about her parents and how bum they are. Think about someone rising up and shooting you in the back of the shotgun as you go to do it. Right. Cause you're a jerk. Anyhow, it's not mine. Isn't about that. Mine is about a serial killer that some call the original night stalker and others called the East area rapist. So this is a guy that, uh, was a rapist, uh, in Sacramento in the mid to late seventies. And I went to college in Sacramento and, uh, it's a, it's the strangest place. It's a floodplain and it's the capital of the state. And it's very hot most of the time. It's kind of like Wild West almost. Yeah. It feels, there's a real like, uh, it doesn't feel like California at all. Yeah. And there's almost no culture whatsoever. It's like, it's a lot of Taco Bells next to shell stations over and over underneath power lines. And maybe that was just the experience I was having there because I went to college there and I flunked out of college a year and a half in failed terribly. Um, but anytime I would drive around, I'd be like, this is the worst. Like everything just seemed scary and awful to me. Sounds like a nightmare. And then the surrounding suburbs, uh, like citrus heights and these kind of like outline went and this area where this East area rapist was going nuts for years has this very like sinister. It's like nice on the outside, but something weird's going on. Everything is beige. Yes. Everything beige. That's where I grew up in Orange County and Irvine, beige. And actually I think he came to Irvine. He did. That was second half. That's right. He was the East area rapist and he wasn't killing people yet. He was just raping women. He was breaking into houses. So he did the thing. He did the recon the day before. He would go, oftentimes people would say we heard something on the roof and we didn't even look. Oh my God. That's why I brought that thing up earlier. He would also break into the houses and look around, do stuff in the houses while they weren't there. Sometimes he would hide rope under the couch cushions and have stuff ready. So they're ready. So he was all ready. Oh my God. He didn't even want to throw up just now. He was sinister. And then so basically then he would break into their house the night of, turn the light on. The couple would be sleeping. That's what this one troubles me the most about this is that he would do it to couples. So he would flash a flashlight in their eyes, tell them to wake up. He'd have a gun on them. He'd have his ski mask. And then he would tell the woman to tie up the man. Then he would go to the kitchen and get a stack of dishes and bring it back and stick it on the man's back. And then he would say to the man, if I hear these dishes move, I will kill both of you. Then he'd take the woman usually, I think it was like half and half, but I think most of the time you would take the woman out into the front room and he would tie her up there and rape her while the husband could hear in the bedroom. Sometimes he would do it there. And then so in the beginning he was just raping the woman and leaving both of them. And he also, while he was doing it, he would talk in a high-pitched voice to himself. To himself? Which is just think of it, just think of, so you're already in this like craze panic. Yeah. Right. I mean, this is what I do with all these stories is I just even for a second try to put yourself there picture. I'm there. I'm there right now. So you're jolted out of sleep to this weird like, what the fuck? And then it's like, someone is talking like this, you know what I mean? Like, there was one thing I just read where he said he was, he was repeating to himself, I'm going to kill him. I'm going to kill him. Like chanting it to himself as he was tying them up. Fuck no. So he seems, there's also a phone call with him. He left a victim a message a week later and I have not listened to it. Is it there? Can you listen? You can listen to it. I think, I think, because whose wife just wrote a really amazing article about that. Michelle McNamara. It's Patton Oswald's wife. She is such a fucking badass, she wrote the best article about it and I'd never heard of it before. Yeah. She has an amazing blog. We will look it up and tell you, it has the word murder in it. But if you put Michelle McNamara in the Google search and murder blog, it'll come up. Also don't kill me for calling, I don't mean to call her someone's wife. That's not who she is. She's more than that. She's clearly so much more. Right. That's right. Yeah. But I know about this serial killer because there's, you know, it's funny when you're, like when you follow this and then it's like, you see one story that's on forensic files or something and then you see it and you piece it together where it's like these, the later murders were reported first on shows like that, like 2020. So it was like the murders in Goleta and Ventura and Dana Point. And then separately, they would report on the East area rapist that was this ridiculous. He had 50 over 50 rape victims and 10 murder victims and they never caught him. That's what's okay. So here's the thing. They never fuck. And you know, I was, they said that maybe he was a construction worker, right? Yeah. They, because he had really intimate knowledge of how these houses and their backyards were set up. Right. So they found a map once that, that was hand drawn, but when he would get caught or people, what anytime there was a close call, cause he liked to mess around and like almost get caught or like do really dangerous things. So there would be a neighbor that would like flip on a light and be like, Hey, and then they would watch him run and vault like backyard fences and stuff like he was in crazy good shape. Yeah. And he was like, he, I think fancied himself a cat burglar, but then off also clearly just was, you know, yeah. But the, the, the, so the creepiest thing, uh, my favorite creepy thing is they, there were so many rapes that were happening in Sacramento that they had a town meeting, uh, like a community meeting, you know, he was there, right? Well, yeah, that's, so, uh, and this, somebody, somebody took a picture of it for the paper. No. So they have a group shot. Oh, of this town meeting. And it's the cops saying this is what's happening. This is the M.O. Look out for this. If you hear something, report it, report it, look, you know, all that kind of stuff. If you see weird people walking, oh, cause also there was never a car found anywhere near the scene. He either walked, jogged, rode a bike or did something parked far away because, and that the couple of times there was a guy walking a dog, but every time they described the guys looking white and like fit and normal, like it's that kind of thing, um, where they, it's the person who can fit in and is totally fitting in and being like a weird murder, cuttlefish fitting in and then disappearing. So, but my favorite thing is so they had this town meeting and at one point the cops are just saying, this is happening and people are really angry because it's so many. It's like in the thirties at this point and this man stands up and says, I don't think you're telling us everything we need to know. I don't think this is even possible. How can a man break into another man's home and, and that man has his wife raped right in front of him and he does nothing. That's impossible. Two weeks later, that man and his wife, yes, that his wife was raped by the East area rapist two weeks later. So they know for a fact he was there because there's a photo and is like everyone identified in it, except for one, no, because it's like such a large group photo. It's like the photographer was standing on the stage in like a high school auditorium look. So there's just, it's, it's really awesome because a lot of times on specials, they'll just take that time to scan that photo and every face in the photo looks guilty. Every face is the scariest thing you've ever seen. It's crazy. Yeah. There's like a, there's like a sketch of him and I'm like, who's dad is that? Cause that guy was young in the seventies, right? Yeah. He's like someone's fucking dad now. Yeah. Or even grandpa. Grandpa. So mom's boyfriend. Horrifying. Horrifying. And the thing that he, like his serious problem with couples and like needing to degrade the man and rape the woman, there's like, there's so much there. Cause that makes it so much harder. The crime's so much harder. So he's clearly specifically doing it for a reason. Yeah. And he's doing it so much, like he just did it and kept on doing it. It was just a thing that was happening in Sacramento for years. And then he, so it was like 76 is when he started the summer of 76. And then I think that it went on for two years in Sacramento, then he went to the East Bay and then somewhere, but I think he went down further, Visalia, cause they think that's where he started. They call them the Visalia ransacker, which is like, um, central night stalker though. I know they, because it was pre, I think it's cause yeah, it was, but, um, it was like, that's really what he was doing. Yeah. Cause he would go and scope it out beforehand, but he just wasn't famous and he basically kind of disappeared. Then when those other, the, those same MMO murders, rapes and murders were happening down here, that's when they finally put it together. And there was finally like, they say that that case in the seventies is why they started developing the DNA database in California because they were going so crazy about not being able to find him. So they could all link them together. Yeah. I think it happened. It happened in Irvine in like the early eighties. I think when I lived there, when I was a baby, and he's still around to, he could potentially still murder. Is he still killing or not that anybody knows, not in that way. Not like he, you know, he would tie people up with very special knots. But Michelle, um, McNamara wrote these amazing articles. If you want to know more about it, like she's gone into it in such a detail. It was, it was an LA magazine, she had an article in LA magazine and she has a ton of stuff on her website. Um, I just want to know, I just want to know the answer. I think that the cut, like for all these things, and it's funny that we're both talking about murders that are unsolved because I, we, I just want to know, I want the problem solved like I want the, what's the, what's the answer to the riddle? And you want it like you want there to be a better policing system where this doesn't happen so often. Yeah. It's so easy to point to like, well, what did they do wrong? And it's so easy to point to it. And you hope that that doesn't happen anymore. But right. Cause this was back in the seventies where they intentionally withheld information if there were like crossing counties and it was all that weird police politics that I think they, you know, they know better now and they don't do anymore, but God is like the dark ages. It's just such a bummer too. When like the answer is a, doesn't make any sense. Like the green river killer, the answer is kind of boring. Yes. It's the guy who was, it's like, God, that guy, like he wanted to be someone like Ted Bundy was satisfying because it's like, he's this diabolical, handsome, intelligent man. It's like, okay, that's a worthy adversary. Yeah. And it's like some fucking like church guy who works in the church office and like is married and it's just like really doesn't like prostitutes. Like what a bummer. But well, I think what's fascinating about the green river killer is his mom was really inappropriate with him. Sometimes I like it when you can trace a little bit like they, of course, we're all just trying to cobble together the why. Yeah. But like his is kind of fascinating. Am I thinking of the BTK killer that was the church parking lot guy, the church, he worked in a church. BTK. Yeah. Yeah. But he did a lot of stuff. Yeah. And the only reason he got caught is because he basically was like, come and get me. Totally. But I mean, yeah, who know? I mean, the thing with being a policeman is it's not your only case. It's not the only thing happening. So if it be like, if it was happening in a vacuum and you could just only focus on that one thing, but other terrible things happen all day every day. When you're in a town that's like, you know, when you're in Chicago or when you're in fucking Detroit, like it's common to have 20 minutes to put it to it. If you could quit your life right now and become a true crime detective with all the funding you wanted and all the research stuff, would you do it? Yes. Me too. Absolutely. I think that. Yeah. I think the. Yeah. I want to be detected. Here's my problem. I don't. I feel as strongly as I love these kinds of fascinating holy shit, what the what are these monsters think murders like gang murder or mafia shit or a husband killed his wife because she was cheating on him. Yeah. I want nothing to do with it. It's so boring. It's so boring, but it's it's so like the heady the failure of humanity, the weakness of humanity. And there's no why. It's obvious. Yeah. Yeah. There's no like there's no blip. It's that you were raised in a shitty neighborhood and here's what everyone does then or like this is what desperation desperation or like you're a man with normal man things and this is how you have an anger problem. Yeah. It's not like not a blip. It's not basically seven, which is like if I could watch that movie for the first time to write such a good movie. It's a beautiful movie. It really is. That's fun. Are we the worst people question and answer this in an email like you have two hundred and fifty words, double space, are we monsters, double space, you know, if you have to say more, you can tighten up those spaces if you need, if you need sure, sure, sure. And if you just want a hundred and forty characters, you can do that. Whatever you need. Just tweet at us. It's about you. So this is the part of our podcast where we want to hear your stories. You tell us what you what horrible things you love and why we want to hear about your like crazy fucked up crime story from your town or that you encountered or that happened to you and you want to hear in your own words, be honest, be honest, email them to Georgia Hardstark. If you spell that wrong, it's your own damn fault at Gmail. And then we'll also record other people that we're friends with telling their stories too. Because everybody has a story about some fucked up thing that happened in their town that they're kind of obsessed with. And if it's not, it doesn't have to be murder, murder, no, no, no, no, no, no, just be a creepy. What's creepy? Yeah. Fucked up story. You can't tell certain people at parties. Yeah. Because certain people will walk away with like a weird white face and rolling their eyes at you. This is a safe space for you. Yeah. Dustin, we're going to have our inaugural story be our awesome podcast producer, the creator and runner of Feral Audio, who's just such a fucking gem. Dustin Martian. Dustin. Okay. My murder story is when I was 16, like I was really, you've not the link, I was like in a charter school and stuff and I was selling LSD and just getting into trouble like constantly. And I was also this, I was downloading like tons of, this is like in the height of Napster and all that stuff. So I was just downloading tons of stuff and they were randomly like arresting people for like downloading stuff. So I came home from school one day and I was walking up to my house and my dad's house is on the corner, like the absolute corner of the intersection. And I walk up and there's like a dozen SWAT guys, full riot gear, guns, and they're like up against the garage, like heading around the corner and I'm like, I'm fucked, I'm fucked. I have acid in my pocket, I have a bunch of acid in my room, I'm like fucked, I'm fucked. And so I just walk up and it was like the color drained from my face and I go inside and they're like, my dad's making them coffee and they're like cops, they're like looking at me and I'm like, huh, like this goth kid and they're gonna mute. So I went downstairs and like hid my acid like crazy and then it turns out two doors down their neighbor was holding his wife and his kids hostage with a shotgun and for whatever reason and then ended up after like hours and hours and hours of it, like shooting the wife and himself in front of the kids and that was like two doors down like our neighbor that you'd see fucking in his yard. I didn't know that personally, but you'd see them like their kids and them in the yard. What city was this? It's a suburb of Madison called Stoughton, Wisconsin. Wow. Great. And you were like, fuck it, I acid's nothing now. Acid and Napster. That's when he threw away all of his drugs and they turned to the Lord. A new. Fuck, that's heavy. That's two doors down. I think I once let a child molester into my house when I was a kid. Let's talk about that another time. That's such a good cliffhanger. Oh, just so everyone knows, Michelle McNamara's website is called truecrimediary.com. It's awesome. She's been following this stuff for years. She's a passionate devotee who's also a great writer. Maybe we can have a story from her one day. You know that. Well, because that's how she started. There was a girl got murdered in her town that was like at her school and she, yeah, that she's, I read all about how she got into it and it's, it's that same thing. That is so fucking cool. Yeah. Thanks for listening, everyone. Guys, this was the first one. You guys are very first favorite murder, but not the last. No, we're Karen Kilgariff, Georgia Heartstark. You can probably find us on the internet. Yeah. And keep listening and go to ferruleaudio.com and listen to all their other cool podcasts and yay. And yay for us. Yay. Thanks. Bye.",

It's\"},{\"currTime\":175,\"text\":\"amazing.

Yeah, but he was also in the\"},{\"currTime\":192,\"text\":\"news, like for the past 18 years. Yes.

So as\"},{\"currTime\":204,\"text\":\"soon and I didn't realize that that's what was going on until they started talking about the\"},{\"currTime\":208,\"text\":\"murder. So the first episode, which I thought was a standalone thing, I thought they were just\"},{\"currTime\":211,\"text\":\"going to talk about like, people who got exonerated.

He\"},{\"currTime\":222,\"text\":\"gets exonerated for rape after 18 years in prison.

If I can save myself because those are the people you work with and you fucking hate them.\"},{\"currTime\":293,\"text\":\"And more more so for me is watching people lie.

I'm gonna act like it when we're really talking to a lawyer\"},{\"currTime\":334,\"text\":\"that's deposing totally at a lawyer who gets paid to argue. So the guy's like, let me finish.\"},{\"currTime\":339,\"text\":\"Like the lawyer ends up feeling like a teacher and this guy's like, I don't remember such a smug\"},{\"currTime\":346,\"text\":\"piece of lies. What do you think? Yeah, he's just all of it. It's so gross. And then it turns\"},{\"currTime\":352,\"text\":\"into and I think we could talk about the crime because this is a murder that we probably would\"},{\"currTime\":356,\"text\":\"have eventually gotten to because it's stuck with me for so it's stuck with me because of what this\"},{\"currTime\":361,\"text\":\"woman went through the torture that she went through. Oh, no. Did you ever hear about it before?\"},{\"currTime\":365,\"text\":\"I don't know because I'm I'm like right in the part where they're looking for her. I mean,\"},{\"currTime\":370,\"text\":\"I obviously know she do you remember there was one where she gets kidnapped and tied up and the\"},{\"currTime\":374,\"text\":\"nephew and the sky raped and tortured her. I remembered it from the because of the nephew\"},{\"currTime\":381,\"text\":\"part. Okay. So when that started happening and they start talking about it around the third\"},{\"currTime\":384,\"text\":\"episode, I was like, oh, shit. And then his nephew comes in. So I'm like, well, this is then he did\"},{\"currTime\":390,\"text\":\"it because I remember this murder. But they get to it's crazy. So wait, basically, you're remembering\"},{\"currTime\":396,\"text\":\"a thing that you saw on like a 2020 style thing. But it was wrong. I don't. Well, that's what we're\"},{\"currTime\":403,\"text\":\"that's what we're examining. Okay, is did he commit this murder or did they set him up because\"},{\"currTime\":408,\"text\":\"this guide Steven Avery is now suing the shit out of the county that put him in jail wrongfully?\"},{\"currTime\":415,\"text\":\"And are they setting him up because this woman disappeared? Right? Are they setting him up for\"},{\"currTime\":419,\"text\":\"the murder? Yeah, that's like the question they're going to answer. I'm positive they are and I'm\"},{\"currTime\":422,\"text\":\"only halfway through the second episode. It's great. And it's wonderful because it's one of those\"},{\"currTime\":426,\"text\":\"things with serial serial where episode to episode, we're like, he's guilty. He's not guilty. He's\"},{\"currTime\":430,\"text\":\"guilty. And they the reason they found out about it is because the nephew confessed. And you're\"},{\"currTime\":437,\"text\":\"like, Well, then he did it. And then they show you they have footage of the nephew confessing.\"},{\"currTime\":441,\"text\":\"And it is. It is troubling. Oh, no. Like when you say I can tell people are lying. He's lying.\"},{\"currTime\":448,\"text\":\"This kid is making this shit up. And it's a false confession. But is it I don't know. I'm sorry.\"},{\"currTime\":453,\"text\":\"Is it? I'm sorry. But it's that weird thing. We're also it's so much easier when you're\"},{\"currTime\":457,\"text\":\"watching a documentary and going like, look at this guy. So it's been laid out for me. Right.\"},{\"currTime\":462,\"text\":\"Like if they were manipulating me to not like people are like people or I fall for that stuff.\"},{\"currTime\":467,\"text\":\"Everything totally, totally, every time. And everyone now, including us, thinks we're like\"},{\"currTime\":473,\"text\":\"fucking we're like sleuths and we're like professional and good at this and can sense\"},{\"currTime\":477,\"text\":\"things and really like we're just we just like have a podcast and like talking about it. Well,\"},{\"currTime\":482,\"text\":\"but I'll tell you this. Here's one thing I can sense is when a big fat smug guy with a mustache\"},{\"currTime\":488,\"text\":\"is lying for sure. I know for sure. I can tell or when they get real like their cadence is very\"},{\"currTime\":494,\"text\":\"condescending like I don't remember. And it's all like, how would I know? Well, how would I know\"},{\"currTime\":499,\"text\":\"that? Yeah, how would I remember this from years ago? Right? Fuck you. It's so funny. Well, it can\"},{\"currTime\":503,\"text\":\"also tell when there's a 16 year old in a police room being deposed by or being questioned without\"},{\"currTime\":514,\"text\":\"parental like guardians or lawyers and being fed information. It's fucking great. Wow. It's\"},{\"currTime\":520,\"text\":\"chilling. So my my hope is that episode 10. Don't watch it without me. I'm like, well,\"},{\"currTime\":525,\"text\":\"watch this together. Oh, good idea. We'll get everyone together who's watching it. Because\"},{\"currTime\":528,\"text\":\"you are live. We could be recording. Watch it together. I don't know. That's great. Something\"},{\"currTime\":533,\"text\":\"will happen. So we just scream the entire time. Just a lot of screaming. You can't even hear it.\"},{\"currTime\":540,\"text\":\"Yeah. Yeah. Let's watch 10 together. You know, what's really funny, too, is I mean, this will\"},{\"currTime\":545,\"text\":\"come out later. But people I bet a lot of people will have watched it by the time this actually\"},{\"currTime\":549,\"text\":\"comes out. What's fun is it's not episodic. You can go binge the fuck out of it right now. Yeah,\"},{\"currTime\":553,\"text\":\"it's all on there. That's the best. But it seems like a bunch of people did that because it was like\"},{\"currTime\":557,\"text\":\"a wildfire totally on Twitter being like making a murder like all of a sudden in a five hour block\"},{\"currTime\":563,\"text\":\"everyone was tweeting that they were watching it. It was weird. Smart. Like I feel like episodic\"},{\"currTime\":567,\"text\":\"makes people more into something. Makes you smarter. No, makes people more into something.\"},{\"currTime\":574,\"text\":\"Oh, oh, like, yes, because you just sit in your house and watch it all day.

    "transcript_text": " We at Wondery live, breathe and downright obsess over true crime and now we're launching the ultimate true crime fan experience, Exhibit C. Join now by following Wondery, Exhibit C on Facebook and listen to true crime on Wondery and Amazon Music, Exhibit C. It's truly criminal. Hey, welcome to my favorite murder. Hey, I'm Karen. I'm Georgia. And we love murder. We love murder. We don't want to get murdered. We love true crime. We love true crime. We love to talk about bad things that have happened to good people. Yep. Hopefully they won't happen to us if we talk about it enough. It's as if we could ward it off with just our with our positive verbal energies and our anxiety over getting murdered. Because sometimes when you share an anxiety, it alleviates it a little bit. Yeah, I think it also lessens the chance of it happening. That's right. We're really we're changing the future with our words or diffusing the possibility of getting stabbed multiple times. We're diffusing the stab bomb. You know what I have a problem with though? Whenever I talk about like murder, how I could die or like on a recording, I just think about them using it when it actually happens in in my like 48 hours. Yes. Yeah. And you're 2020. For example, there's a video, our new favorite show that I wouldn't let you talk about with me. There's a video. Let me just tell people who are listening. Start from the very beginning. Georgia was very harsh with me when I arrived at her apartment. She said, have you been watching that? And I said, don't talk about it. Have you been watching? I barely had the word watching out and she screamed, don't talk about it. But didn't explain that she wanted to save it for the podcast was as if this was a forbidden. Like I literally was like, never talk about it. Like how I am with Sex in the City. Don't talk about it in front of me. Oh, you don't want to spoiler. Is that why? Right. Ever in my life. I want to keep that pure for the rest of my days. You've never seen one. You've never done one episode. I saw part of once when they went to LA and it was it really depressed me. Fair enough. Okay, let's talk about it. Okay, I meant I meant we'll save it for the show. Okay, this is the show. Okay, there's I just started watching it yesterday. Same with me. What episode are you on? Two. Okay, this is fun. Because I'm on like, it just we just finished three. Oh, okay. The show we're talking about is making of a murder, making a murder, making a murderer on Netflix. It's like, think the jinx, but fucking better. Yeah. Do you love it? It's amazing. What I think is amazing is we are truly now in this era where everyone's life has been recorded in some way, because there is so much footage of that guy so much so much footage. And you realize it's because that's how everything works these days. Yeah, but he was also in the news, like for the past 18 years. Yes. So the story is that and it's really funny because this story there's two separate stories here, one of which the murder I already knew about. So as soon and I didn't realize that that's what was going on until they started talking about the murder. So the first episode, which I thought was a standalone thing, I thought they were just going to talk about like, people who got exonerated. Oh, the first episode is the story of the guy Steven Avery getting spoilers. Yeah, but you're going to see the first episode. It's fine. He gets exonerated for rape after 18 years in prison. And kind of finding out that he's been railroaded by his own cousin and the people that right in his community. It's one of those like it's like the West Memphis three words like how the fuck did this get as far as it did. Yeah. One of those like these guys clearly a huge miscarriage of justice. This is terrifying. We could go to prison at any moment for anything. Yeah. Well, yes, because the the you pull back, you realize it's that freaky thing of like, as you pull back and realize this is happening all over the country, all over the world, where people in power, it's an abuse of power and people just doing whatever they want to do. There's these amazing interviews because all the depositions, there's like hundreds of hours of depositions. And it's these people that I swear to God, if it was a sketch show, you'd be like that guy's too broad. Totally. Like the the mealy mouthed district attorney guy with the little glasses and the kind of perfectly balding head that was like, they are so depressing. Like this they are the reasons I point to all of them that I never want to work in an office job again. If I can save myself because those are the people you work with and you fucking hate them. And more more so for me is watching people lie. It's so fascinating because you can smell a lie. It doesn't matter how you think you might be good at it or how do you know you're who do you think you are? Everyone knows you're lying. And there that one sheriff who is kind of big with the mustache that yes, who did a drawing and got them framed like a fucking disgusting like he's the guy who goes hunting and gets like, and like kills an animal with like a shot to the head and then frames it on as well. Crazy. I mean, like just the the level of smugness and the way that guy would talk what I made me love that he talks like I'm you're stupid. I am so much smarter than you. I'm gonna act like it when we're really talking to a lawyer that's deposing totally at a lawyer who gets paid to argue. So the guy's like, let me finish. Like the lawyer ends up feeling like a teacher and this guy's like, I don't remember such a smug piece of lies. What do you think? Yeah, he's just all of it. It's so gross. And then it turns into and I think we could talk about the crime because this is a murder that we probably would have eventually gotten to because it's stuck with me for so it's stuck with me because of what this woman went through the torture that she went through. Oh, no. Did you ever hear about it before? I don't know because I'm I'm like right in the part where they're looking for her. I mean, I obviously know she do you remember there was one where she gets kidnapped and tied up and the nephew and the sky raped and tortured her. I remembered it from the because of the nephew part. Okay. So when that started happening and they start talking about it around the third episode, I was like, oh, shit. And then his nephew comes in. So I'm like, well, this is then he did it because I remember this murder. But they get to it's crazy. So wait, basically, you're remembering a thing that you saw on like a 2020 style thing. But it was wrong. I don't. Well, that's what we're that's what we're examining. Okay, is did he commit this murder or did they set him up because this guide Steven Avery is now suing the shit out of the county that put him in jail wrongfully? And are they setting him up because this woman disappeared? Right? Are they setting him up for the murder? Yeah, that's like the question they're going to answer. I'm positive they are and I'm only halfway through the second episode. It's great. And it's wonderful because it's one of those things with serial serial where episode to episode, we're like, he's guilty. He's not guilty. He's guilty. And they the reason they found out about it is because the nephew confessed. And you're like, Well, then he did it. And then they show you they have footage of the nephew confessing. And it is. It is troubling. Oh, no. Like when you say I can tell people are lying. He's lying. This kid is making this shit up. And it's a false confession. But is it I don't know. I'm sorry. Is it? I'm sorry. But it's that weird thing. We're also it's so much easier when you're watching a documentary and going like, look at this guy. So it's been laid out for me. Right. Like if they were manipulating me to not like people are like people or I fall for that stuff. Everything totally, totally, every time. And everyone now, including us, thinks we're like fucking we're like sleuths and we're like professional and good at this and can sense things and really like we're just we just like have a podcast and like talking about it. Well, but I'll tell you this. Here's one thing I can sense is when a big fat smug guy with a mustache is lying for sure. I know for sure. I can tell or when they get real like their cadence is very condescending like I don't remember. And it's all like, how would I know? Well, how would I know that? Yeah, how would I remember this from years ago? Right? Fuck you. It's so funny. Well, it can also tell when there's a 16 year old in a police room being deposed by or being questioned without parental like guardians or lawyers and being fed information. It's fucking great. Wow. It's chilling. So my my hope is that episode 10. Don't watch it without me. I'm like, well, watch this together. Oh, good idea. We'll get everyone together who's watching it. Because you are live. We could be recording. Watch it together. I don't know. That's great. Something will happen. So we just scream the entire time. Just a lot of screaming. You can't even hear it. Yeah. Yeah. Let's watch 10 together. You know, what's really funny, too, is I mean, this will come out later. But people I bet a lot of people will have watched it by the time this actually comes out. What's fun is it's not episodic. You can go binge the fuck out of it right now. Yeah, it's all on there. That's the best. But it seems like a bunch of people did that because it was like a wildfire totally on Twitter being like making a murder like all of a sudden in a five hour block everyone was tweeting that they were watching it. It was weird. Smart. Like I feel like episodic makes people more into something. Makes you smarter. No, makes people more into something. Oh, oh, like, yes, because you just sit in your house and watch it all day. And it like becomes your life. Totally. Like now that Fargo's over, what am I going to watch? For real. God bless Fargo. Right. Gorgeous. If Kirsten Dunst doesn't win all the awards, even like the ones that don't make any sense. I'm going to be bummed. Did I already brag to you that I know the casting director? No, she goes to my dog park. No. Yeah, she became dog park friends. And then after chatting and she's just a total like one of us kind of gal. Oh my God, turns up that. And so I we have each other's phone numbers like to text because everyone's want to be like, Oh, text me if you're going to go. Yeah. So we'll be at the dog park at the same time. Holy shit. And if you're going to go bring Kirsten Dunst. The first episode I watched I text her, I'm like, this show is amazing because I was, I loved the first season and I was like, there's no way the second season is going to be as good. And it was like so good. So good. So good. So yeah, everyone go watch. What is it? Making of a murder. Making of a murderer. Making of a murderer. Tell us about it. Oh, I made us a Facebook fan page, not fan. I made a my favorite murder, a Facebook page. Nice. So everyone go on there and talk about that and tell us your your your town murder, all this stuff. Yes, we want to know what's happened. What happened in your town that you've been talking about? Yeah, since you were 10. We want to know your Facebook murder, your favorite murder. What could be the Facebook murder? What if there was a Facebook murderer? Oh, there's a Craigslist murderer. Yeah, not a face. It's so low rent. So should we get to what our favorite murders are? Yes, for this episode. Yeah. Do you want to go first? You want me to go to first? You want me to go first? You want me to go first? Yeah. This is one of the ones where I've done less research on it. But I know it. I know the story in my heart. Totally. These are these are more fun. It's a murder of my heart. But it's the Paul Bernardo Carla Hamulca husband and wife murder team, where it was in, I believe it was Toronto. Yes. Yes. And in the early 90s, and it was a weird power dynamic abusive relationship. And he basically he basically got his wife to help him lure teenage girls into their home so that he could rape them and and ultimately murder them. And they started off with her younger sister. I remember I love this one. It's so crazy. They drugged her younger sister who was like 14. Yeah. They put drugs in her drink. And then like they roofied her and then he raped her and she videotaped it. Yeah, this is her younger, her younger sister. You thought Canada was all made to syrup and politeness. Totally. And there's one exception to that rule. And it's Paul Bernardo. But the reason I like this, aside from the insanity of that part, where they would drive around looking for teen girls, it's so scary because you think like you see a woman and you're like, I'm safe. Like if something is like, let's say for some reason, I was hitchhiking, which I would fucking never do because I'm terrified of murder. But it had happened that I was and a couple stopped. I'd be like, this is okay because the woman's here. Yes. So he's not going to murder me with his like wife or whatever, which is that's how you know the story of the woman. Yep. In the box. Oh my God. It's so crazy. Yep. Georgia, the way you just did that, I wish you guys could have seen. You practically winked at me or like, yep, say no more. This is a day where Georgia knows everything I'm going to say to her. I do. But that girl, the woman got into the car because it was a couple in the front seat. And then they put her head in a carpeted box. How terrifying. So awful. And then they ended up keeping her in a box under the bed for seven years. And then they tied her up. Did you see the photo of her tied up from her trial? No. They don't show her face, but she's like splay naked. And you know what the most fucked up thing about that story is, is that they brought her home to her house to be like, look, she's fine, everyone. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And that in and of itself was this big, a huge thing for him because he had the trial. And that idea that like, there's a syndicate that's out to get you so you can't go anywhere. You can't tell anybody. He made her, he told her that he made her sign a thing. Yeah. That said the company, I think he called it the company. I mean, would you, you wouldn't be like, I would never believe that as soon as I, I've actually, I thought about these like, I would just start screaming the minute I got in the door of my family's house because he was like, look, we're dating. Everything is normal. So you can stop looking for her. But he broke her. He broke her. He broke her in the on the deepest psychological level. So it can't be that hard when you're putting someone in boxes to break them. It actually isn't. I don't think you if you, if you feed people like only sugar, don't let them sleep, make them jump around. That's how cults do it. Sugar really? That's like a, yeah. That's all like the moonies would do it. Why? Just because your, your brain is, if you don't have enough protein and you only, you only eat sugar, then you have these weird energy bursts and you do like a lot of crazy stuff and then you are exhausted, but then they wake you up at three in the morning. Yeah. Do a weird. I'm, I'm putting myself in a cult then because I was just constantly, I mean, cookies, am I right? It is crazy. I need to eat more protein. Yes. So anyway, but here's the, here's my Twisteroo. That's kind of a hometown story. So Paul Bernardo was the husband of this hideous. They, of course, eventually caught him, but when they caught him, they, in taking his DNA, they linked him to a long standing set of unsolved rapes. They were calling them, they're calling him the Scarborough Rapist. And it was from a certain neighborhood in, it's Toronto, right? I keep thinking it might be Montreal. It's Canada. It's, I'm pretty sure it's Toronto, but let us know if I'm wrong. Yeah. Always. On the Facebook page. Give me a thumbs up if I'm wrong. But so the Scarborough Rapist was, was people were terrified. It went on for years. Scarborough, New York? No, no, no. In Canada. Sorry. This is the one that I didn't look at. I'm pretty sure it's, it's a neighborhood of Toronto. Okay. Got it. But so my friend Paul Greenberg, who you might know him from that one year that Neil Patrick Harris hosted the Emmys and he walked out behind him and just stood and stared. Why did he do that? It was a bit. Oh, okay. He's a writer and he's a comic. He's really funny. So anyway, he told me this story and this is my favorite. So the years before Paul Bernardo and his wife started killing young girls for his pleasure. There was a Scarborough Rapist and so Paul's mother was at the time, I guess, in her seventies probably. And she lived in an apartment building that had a swimming pool at the top. And she's a really good artist. And so she would go up and swim laps every day and, you know, she's retired and I think she lived by herself. Anyway, one day she's up there, swimming laps, and a young man comes out onto the roof. And she doesn't really think much of it, you know, she's swimming laps. And then she notices that he's walking along the pool as she's swimming laps. Oh my god, like lapping. Like lapping with her walking back and forth. And so she like looks up and sees it and there's no one else up there. That's threatening. So she just keeps swimming laps and he's like tracking her and staring at her. And she's like, you know, an elderly woman swimming. Jesus. And he's just like, she said it was the scariest thing ever. And then she didn't know what to do. At one point she was just treading water and like staring and didn't know what to do. And then the door burst open and like three families came out and, you know, came to use the pool and all the kids jumped in the pool and he left. Okay. So she got out of the pool, put on put on a towel. That's really important. I was scared she was just flipped on some flip flops. And she went down to her apartment and drew a picture of his face. She had to do it while she remembered it. So then she put the picture, she called the cops, they said, you know, it's like a complaint or whatever. And then however many years it was later, let's say three or five, when they showed Paul, Paul Bernardo on the news for this husband and wife killing thing, the mom walks over and pulls the picture out of the drawer and it's him. It was Paul Bernardo that was doing that. And then later on with DNA, they linked him. Did she call and was like, listen dudes? Well, at that point, they had, I think they'd already figured out that he was also the Scarborough rapist. Holy shit. So he was just raping all over the place. And like, and doing stuff like that, like, like was the name essentially, you know, it sucks about being a woman is you never know. Like if something is nothing or not, you know, that's right. Like you might just see this guy pacing and you never see him again, or you might go in your house and he's standing in your living room. That's right. Like what is nothing or like a boyfriend is stalking you or due to stalking you. Is it nothing or this guy going to murder me? You just don't know. I mean, not the stalking isn't awful too. But like, is he just like obsessed for the next couple weeks until I find someone else or is he a murderer? Right. That's like the day that I was at the dog park alone at like seven in the morning. And I looked up and there was a guy, I thought at first that he was chipping balls on one side of the dog park. And then I looked and he had a sword. And he was just swinging a sword around and I was just like, well, this is either my last downer. Yeah. Or maybe my dog will attack him, but probably not. Yeah. It's not really her style. And I just waited and he eventually left. Was he like, practicing in an open space or just being a fucking weirdo? He was by the bushes. So there was a weird element to it. Yeah, it wasn't cool. It's another thing aside from a woman being present that you're like, your guard is down, but like daytime. Yes, morning. Guard is down when it's light out. Yeah, you don't expect anything to happen. Which is why it's the perfect time. And dog park, the most innocent person. Dog park. Yeah. We're only good things happen. All right. It smells like why would you want to go there if you didn't have to? Out of there. Yeah. What makes a person a murderer? Are they born to kill? Or are they made to kill?

Okay, I'm not going to belittle myself. All right. Because this is my favorite. I'm not going to belittle myself of all places, not on our murder podcast, Georgia. Because this isn't an interesting, oh, I meant to add a thing to your thing. The woman, what's her name? Carla Hamoka. Cut out of jail a while ago. Oh, yeah, that's right. She's out. That was a big part of it is she tried to say that he was controlling her mind, which some people say is very possible, because she was a victim of his abuse as well. But at the same time, you're still a responsible though for what you do. You can't kill your younger sister and think that that's just going to go, you know, did they accidentally kill her or was it on purpose? Did they drug her and she had an overdose? I don't remember. That could be part of the story. I don't remember, but she's out. Isn't that weird that like she's just out? Yeah. That's so let's talk about some of the benefits of being a woman. Shorter murder sentences. Yeah. More benefit of the doubt. Yeah. You take some shit. You get some shit. Yeah. In your sister's death and you killed her. And then you kill your sister. No, you have to buy one less Christmas present every year. Yeah, right. Maybe that sister was a real pain in the ass. Do you think her parents just talk to her or no, still? I'd say probably no. I know. If they killed the teen sister. Parents are so forgiving though. I guess that they're like one line you can cross and it's like killing her. I mean, who knows? It really puts them in a bad position. Okay, my favorite murder. Okay, this is it's like a it's not as interesting, but it's my favorite because I feel like it changed the course of history so drastically that everything would be different today. Lincoln's assassination. No, but not far from that. Okay, all right. I think our world would be it's such a better place if this person hadn't been killed. Robert F. Kennedy. Oh, because he was a good person and a darling JFK was just a fucking flashy playboy. But RFK hot take Georgia. Yeah, I just it makes me so sad that he was killed and and I don't think there was a conspiracy even though there's they're trying to make a million conspiracies of it. There's the girl in the polka dot dress. Do you remember that that thing where they say there's a girl in a polka dot dress who was mind controlling him? What's the mind control thing that they call MK ultra MK ultra and she she mind controlled Sirhan Sirhan to shoot Robert F. Kennedy. Yes, and ran out. They saw someone said they she ran out of the Ambassador Hotel where he was killed screaming. We shot him, you know, whenever found her. Um, yeah. And if you were if you were some kind of a super deep agent, yeah, in the MK ultra program, would you be would you yell that? You can get a little more controller. I think you'd be better at your job than that. That was a really good point. Like you could do all of these things. But yet you start screaming. You snap. I mean, that's an interesting. I mean, I I don't put it past anything that the kind of things that have gone on governmentally. Sure. I believe in all of those. I believe in the idea that they were trying to train people to be like sleeper murderers. Do you just like would wake up and shoot somebody? Do you believe it? Yeah. Like Manchurian candidate style. Because they like, do you hear? Do you fucking hear my? Is that your cat? That's my fucking cat screaming in the other room. And this is why I can't sleep at night. Maybe your cat's in pain. She's not. I've taken her to the doctor multiple times. She's fine. Okay. She's fucking fine. She's an idiot. Is she screaming? We shot him. Is she the sleeper agent that we've been fearing all along? Probably. She's already ruining my life. You know what? If they could control cats, that would be it. I mean, it would be over. Cutest army. The other thing is she probably if you're going to think about it, she wouldn't have worn a polka dot. Like, why would you wear something so like easily explainable? Right? You'd wear a black dress. You'd wear pants and like you would look normal. There's so many ways to blend in. That's polka dots. Polka dots always says, Hey, look at Minnie Mouse over here. Polka dots, white gloves. I'm here to have fun. It's me. The town slut. I'm here for the shooting. So you really think who do they pick and why? Just like maybe criminals that no one will believe anyways. Could be that. Could be like, you know, Jason Bourne style. You were already in the army and then you got pulled into some kind of special program. And they just be on so much LSD for so long that your brain is as mush. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck, that would suck. I know. It would be crazy. But also it's weird that like, I don't know, all of that stuff is so crazy because it's like who is it the government or is it the mafia or is it, you know, the, the Kennedys have not had a good time of it in terms of being murdered. Yeah. But I think, I don't know. Are they, are they all just like, I think everyone in a public place in government is just a fucking puppet. Sure. So it's the bit, the rich, big business people behind the scenes. Right. You know, the Dow Chemical family, the guy from Fox catching. Oh my God, totally him. Did you watch the movie board the shit out of me? But then I watched the 30 for 30. Yeah, about it. And you're like, Oh, he this was so perfect and correct and right. And it's fucked up. It's better than the movie. Oh, I have to see that. I loved that movie. I was bored. It may be because I went by myself. And when I go see movies by myself, it makes me feel like I'm French or something. I get real stuck up about myself and like doing something. You're going to see a film. That's not a movie. It's not a movie. It's a film. Well, I had no idea what to expect. Vince was like, there's something about wrestling. And I was like, okay. And like, I went and I was like, this is the most sport I didn't know. I think the half the audience in the theater when I went, we're watching a Correll comedy. So they only laughed when it was like when he when he brings the trophy. And he's like, I have a trophy now, mother or whatever. He did some weird speech and everyone's like kind of laughed, but they were just confused the whole time. Oh my God, they were watching a movie. You were watching a film. I was there for the film in my red polka dot. It's good. You should watch the 30 for 30 of it. Um, yeah, am I allowed to do boring murders like that? No, yes, because it's it's more the concept of it. Like, what was he up to that they needed to take him out? Well, here's the thing is the reason. But see, the problem with me is that I have is that the reason Sirhan Sirhan who was arrested and is in prison for life for it was killed him makes complete sense. Whereas like, what's his little squirrely name who killed Lee Harvey, Lee Harvey, it's like, well, it doesn't really sound like. So Sirhan, the RFK was a supporter of Israel. Sirhan Sirhan was a Palestinian Jordan, Jordanian immigrant. And the day the day that RFK was killed was on the anniversary of the start of the six days war. So he killed RFK for his support of Israel, which makes sense through the six days war real fast. Israel kicked the kicked ass for like six days. Oh, it was a bad. I have a whole book on it. If you want, it's real boring. It's real boring. Is that how they, they set up the strip or whatever? Oh, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Is that how they got their walls? Yeah. I don't know. I know nothing about anything. But so he, yeah, so that makes sense of the why this crazy person, there wasn't a lot of bodyguards going on at the ambassador hotel. RFK had just won the democratic or was about to win the preliminaries in California. So he's at, he's in a room full of people who are supporting him. So he doesn't have that much, you know, reason to fear things. Right. Yeah. Right. Well, but, but there's got to be the weird thing is what didn't that guy work at the hotel? No. Oh, he didn't. Was it really the bus boy? I thought he was like, at least dressed up like a bus boy. Oh, maybe. There are people who have dedicated their lives to studying this. So much. Didn't that happen at a hotel? Listen, we, here at my favorite murder, we're fucking talking mad shit. And if you want something more than that, then you need to go watch the documentary. Then read your books. Yeah. Like, we're not prevent pretending to be good talkers. No. So yeah. And then there's also a theory that if you listen to the recording, there are more than eight shots fired, which Sir Han, Sir Han only had a gun, a 22 caliber with eight rounds in it. Wow. But you can hear like up to 13 maybe. So maybe there's a second shooter. Well, it sounds like there would have to be unless there was echoing. But I just feel like if you watch documentaries about RFK, his like, his stance on on racism and what he was doing for the poor and for minorities was so extreme from anything we've any way we've ever treated people before, I think our world would have been a fucking much better place. I think that honestly, like, I think that there was a break in the space time continuum and everyone else when he didn't die, got to live in a great fucking world and we're stuck in this bullshit where he got killed. Wow. I really do think there was like a, what do they call them? Alternate reality. Alternate reality. A sliding doors starting going. Yes. And Gwyneth Paltrow, we got stuck with her in this one. And then the other one, there's no Gwyneth Paltrow. The other one at Sandy Bullock the whole time. Yeah. All Sandy Bullock all the time. Good times. Life is better. And here we are. Well, that's dark, but I kind of thank you. I like, I like the concept of it, like imagine a world where somebody, a leader who actually really did have the people's best intentions of heart got through because that's almost seems impossible these days. I think he had, I think he had that. And I think we didn't deserve it. And he couldn't, he couldn't live because we didn't fucking deserve it. I'm such a good person. Not you. And I'm clearly you and I are like the best, right? I'm, I'm super nice to everybody all the time. I'm really understanding. I'm so patient. I'm so patient and kind. I don't care when people drive like shit. I won't scream at them. I don't scream terrible things out the window of my car. People or we don't sit at a diner and talk shit on every single person. Oh my God. Is it time? It's our second podcast diner time where we talk public mad shit where we don't know where Mike's and we just talk shit on every single person. That would be, I feel like I can't believe that hasn't happened yet. Just truth. Just like a, well, I mean, I think there are some people that do podcasts mistakenly, but the idea of that a gossip podcast where people just suck shit. You listen to it every, if they put out five a week, you'd listen to everyone. Yeah. But can we be anonymous and no one knows who we really are? Well, we can. I was too late for us. Well, maybe two other random girls haven't podcasted on Feral Audio. Isn't that weird? And it's just these two anonymous girls and they talk mad shit. They sound a lot like Karen and those girls from Ohio. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Those girls, they're bitches. Let's talk shit about this girl. Let's talk shit. Mad shit. Okay. Yes. So those, those are two good ones. Those are, those are pretty good ones. Here's the first thing I thought of when you said Robert Kennedy. You know how he had a hand in shutting down that. I shouldn't get into this one because it's a whole other topic. Say it quick. It's a, I think it was called Westbrook or Brookhaven or Sunnybrook or whatever, but it's that mental hospital that's on Long Island or Staten Island, I mean, that got shut down in the 60s because they were basically just taking developmentally disabled children and throwing them into big dark rooms and hosing them off every day. And like it was, I think it was one of Geraldo's first exposés. She went in there. I remember that. And they like on the single light on the camera, it looks like a horror movie from today where it's just kids huddled up. And when Robert Kennedy saw that, he went and shut that place down himself. That's the first thing I thought of. But that's where they think there's a serial killer that, that lives on the grounds of that hospital. That there's an, there's a, what's it called? Something C. Yes. There's a Clancy Clancy or something like that. That's a gold. I know. Watch the movie. There's a Netflix. It's so good. It's really good. Um, it's called Stoxy. No, Crop C. Crop C. That's it. Crop C. It's really good and creepy. Remember a word with Karen in Georgia. Sounded out and work it out. It's a Banksy. Oh my God, we just saw two Banksy is Banksy's Crop C. Banksy's killing developmentally disabled children on Staten Island. Yeah, that's some fucked up shit. And unfortunately they also then like Reagan and Nixon just opened the fucking asylums and let everyone go. And which is why we have this homeless problem and mental illness issue. My mom was a psychiatric nurse and she in the, in the late seventies and early eighties when that proposition came up and it was Reagan. It was Reagan. Sorry. Sorry, Nixon. Nixon was long gone, but she used to rant about it every single night and she called exactly what's happening today. She's like, these people will have nowhere to go. They will be wandering on the streets. They'll be assaulting people. They'll be like, these people need to be taken care of. And this is the coldest, like the idea that a leader would be like that you don't take care of the people that need help the most. And you just shut off all funding for that and say it's not our problem creates such huge problems. Listen, I'm going to say it right now. I would rather pay more taxes to get people mental fucking help and not have as much money myself than live in a world where we don't fucking take care of people. And there are just rampant mental illness and homeless and starving people. Yeah. And that idea of it's too bad for you. Like I got mine. Yeah. When how did you even get yours? Right. People helped you. Right. Totally. Horrible. Everything is horrible. And if RFK hadn't died, that would have never fucking happened. That could have changed. What if he went and fist fought Reagan? And that was like, it was an actual battle. I did not hear fist fought. I heard something totally else and I just can't give it to myself. That's what I just heard when you said I was like, why'd she say that? But it's when you thought what I said. You said fist fought past tense of fist fight is what I said. That's not what I heard. Oh, yeah, they should have fought. They should have fist fought. They should have fist fought. Or where am I? Um, yeah. And in alternative universe, though, there is just the most beautiful asylums and we go there sometimes when we just need a break. Yeah. They're all garden. Yeah. And everyone knows how to properly prescribe medication. And the medication is free. Flowing overflowing just bowls of medication everywhere. Like fountains. Fountains of Prozac. I'll take it. Open my mouth. Just like stick my head under the. I get some. Sure. Just relax. Yeah. There's the Adderall fountain. It's never abused. I'm not great. Everyone graduates from college. Oh, drugs. Let's. Okay. So now is the time in our lives when we have a guest tell us their, their, our favorite thing in the world, their town crime. Yes. We love it. Like, what's the crime that happened in your town that like you remember when you were a kid and you're like, Holy shit, this thing happened. It's amazing. Tell us on Facebook page. We're just calling it Facebook page now. Facebook page, the Facebook page. Tell us on Facebook page, your town. Don't message us because we don't care. Put it on the page. Like so everyone can bask in it. Yeah. Don't put a link. Like tell it in your fucking words. Put a link too because that's cool. But it's almost like a creepypasta that you're writing. Totally. But it's your, it's true. Yeah. Like what's the truth? Tell us. Don't make it up. We'll know. Oh yeah. We can fact check this. We won't fact check it. We can fact check it. We won't. All right. So our story this week comes from our friend Allie Ward. She is a friend of mine. We're on shit together. She's also on Innovation Nation on Saturday mornings. Allie Ward. You can find her by that name on everything. Okay. So let's listen to her message. Hey, what's up? This is Allie. So okay. You asked me to call and tell you about this murder that happened in my high school. And I went to school in Arenda, California, which is like very wealthy, nice suburb near Berkeley. I went to the Maramonte and they had a really good college prep program. They had like a Latin program. So my family lived in the area until we graduated. But Arenda was known for being this very Tony suburb where this horrendous, like so such a stupid murder that it seems fake. But what happened was this girl named Kirsten Costas was a popular girl. She was from a very affluent family as well. She was like a cheerleader and she was part of the sorority program at my high school, which sounds like like, well, I'm sorry, it's high school. But yeah, there was like, there was sorority in my high school. That's how, that's how much extra money people had. So there were these two competing sororities. Anyway, there was a girl named Bernadette Clottie who was in the lesser sorority, I think, and she was really jealous of Kirsten. And she was trying to befriend her, but she told her at one point that she was going to take her to this dinner for new pledges or whatever. And according to police records or whatever, they went to this dinner. Kirsten was like annoyed because there wasn't food being served. I don't know because that part sounds weird because I went cheerleader in the 1980s, like none of them. Anyway, Bernadette apparently got weird, according to Kirsten. And then Kirsten fled to a neighbor's house and said, my friend's acting weird. They're like, okay, I'll drive you home. So they, this like neighbor drove her home. And then there was a pinto following them the whole way in the pinto with Bernadette Clottie with an 18 inch knife, knife in her car, in her pinto. So the neighbor dropped off Kirsten. Bernadette runs up the door. The neighbor thought he saw this fight, but no, it was a knife fight, a one person knife fight. And Bernadette just stabbed the shit out of Kirsten Kostas. Totally killed her. Um, she died before she got to hospital and Bernadette got sentenced, but she, she got out by the time she was like 23, but she, she wasn't even implicated for months. She passed a lie detector test and like, I guess no one saw that it was her doing the stabbing. I don't know why they weren't like, who drives the pinto? You know, like, Oh, it's Bernadette. She killed her. I don't know that I, I don't know, but they made a movie called death of a cheerleader starting Tory spelling as Kirsten who gets stabbed. And there's lore that Heather's is based on the high school I went to, which is why I was gone when I went there. Cause I was like, I'm not having any part of this, you guys. Nobody wants to be friends with me anyway. Anyway, sorry, murder. Oh, that's such a big blade. Oh, don't join shorty. They're full of bad people. Okay. Wow. Holy mackerel. She really hit it out of the park on that one. That's a good story. Cheerleader stabbing each other. Yeah. I can't believe she's out. She got out. Why do people get out of prison? Well, cause they were start young and then it's like insanity, maybe. Fuck man. It'd be good to know about that one. Yeah. Cause that's a, that gives you a lot of hope. Definitely changed your name. I'm really fascinated with like child murderers. Like there's this Mary bell. There's those two boys in England who took that kidnap that little kid out of them all. Yeah. So they all got out by the time they were, you know, not even a, they got out of 18 or whatever the fuck, changed her name and left. And I just want to talk to them so that well, because if you're a child murder or something hideous is happening to you, you, that's the fascinating thing about the Mary bell case. Her mother was selling her to men when she was a child. I mean, they're the rage that was in her. It doesn't come from nowhere. It's not just like, Oh, I'm, I, it was impulsive or whatever. This is someone acting out and it's like a weird cry for help. Totally. There's a really good, like a British made for TV movie about Mary bell. Really? Yeah. That kind of goes into that fucking vintage murders, man. Come on. They're so interesting because you take it on face value and it's just like, Oh, that's crazy. Like a six year old that murdered a little boy. Yeah. But that's not, yeah. There's more to it. Always. Fuck. What was the, I'm sorry. I have a message from Ally Ward. Oh, hold on. Ally Ward called Dustin. She forgot to mention that the murderers sister said she kept an 18 inch knife in her pinto to slice vegetables while she drove. As one does, you know what? I smell a rat. I smell. Listen, man, if I know one of my siblings are guilty of murder, I'm going to fucking tell on you. Yeah. You know why? Because the siblings of the murdered person matter more. I'm also, you know, as a creative person, I would take pride in the lie that I'm telling and slicing vegetables while I drive is a poor, it's a poor lie. I mean, we, and we all know you, all you do is use a fucking exacto knife. What are those blades called that are? Yeah, like a box cutter. Yeah. Right. When you cut your vegetables in the car while you're driving, she's a fucking box cutter or just some kitchen scissors. Yeah. Chop up. Yeah. Nothing about that even makes sense. It's what are you? Let's get her on the podcast. What are we? What the fuck were you thinking? Like let's piss her off on the podcast and see what happens. Also, think of an 18 inch blade is six inches longer than a 12 inch blade. Yeah. It's more, it's like a kitchen knife. Two feet long. A kitchen knife is like a 12 inch. Yeah. So that's even like think of a kitchen knife. Now think of an extra blade on top of it, double blade. We're going into Katana Sword area. Yeah. With the length of this knife. Let's put the knife show on. Let's see. Cutlery corner going. Cutlery corner is the best. If you don't watch, if you don't get high and watch the knife show, I don't smoke pot. I'm not condoning it. Something is wrong with you. Sometimes it's on perfectly like right after our comedy shows over. That's what happened when I was in San Francisco. We came back and it was like two 15 and I couldn't go to sleep. And then I was like, well, look who's here. All the assorted knives. That's the one. Should we wrap it up? Wrap it up. Yeah. Go to Facebook page. Facebook page. Go to any Facebook page. Anyone. And talk about us. And visit people and just live your life. Yeah. Digitally. Yeah. Don't leave your house. You're going to get murdered if you leave your house. And definitely talk about us on Facebook page. Yeah. Talk about us on Facebook page and tell everyone on Reddit to listen. I feel like Reddit people would like this podcast a lot, but I'm not on Reddit. I thought it might be frustrating to some Reddit types who like facts and like a fluidly chronologically told story. Please. Again, go watch the documentary. This is not what we're here for. We're like, we like, we're like a puree. We're like a Jamba juice of facts. Yeah. Yeah. That we're like, um, we were like, uh, what are those two guys in, uh, in Vegas who play with tigers? Yep. Were those guys like, we're not going to find out the history of tigers and like what they're, you know, what they're about. You're going to see the best part of the tiger and our tans and our tans. Yeah. Yeah. Our teeth, our tans and the best part of the tiger. And hopefully we don't get molded by our tiger, which is the murders that that's, can I just say this and then we'll stop the day that there was the story in the paper of how the, um, it was either Siegfried or Rory. I can't remember which one got attacked, but the day that was in the paper about him being mauled by the tiger was the same day that they caught the green river killer. And I remember going from, I was reading the LA times and it went from like one small story, turn the page, the other small story where I was like, both of these stories are the hugest thing to happen in the last 20 years. And they're both like four column, like tiny, tiny stories. People don't know what's important anymore. No, they really don't, you know, it's like our media man is like telling us how to live. Yeah. Well, that's a good, I like that. It's a little tie, a little bow tie on the tied it up. Good job. Listen to us on other stuff and go to us on other places. We have other things. We live other lives sometimes. Um, but we're slowly building so that this takes over everything. Yeah. Make sure this takes over everything for your life too. Yeah. Get obsessed with this. Yep. There you go. We're Karen and Georgia. Thanks for listening. Thanks.",

good.\"},{\"currTime\":125,\"text\":\"Okay, so you know how, Karen, you know how one of the many ways that you can collect and\"},{\"currTime\":132,\"text\":\"present evidence is by matching hair

two decade period.\"},{\"currTime\":158,\"text\":\"No.\"},{\"currTime\":159,\"text\":\"95% of the 268 trials viewed so far says that they overstated forensic

pulling\"},{\"currTime\":179,\"text\":\"up those like the microscopic things, the slides.\"},{\"currTime\":183,\"text\":\"And you see the ridges and you see the color.\"},{\"currTime\":186,\"text\":\"It turns out in one of the cases, it turned out to be dog hair that they found.\"},{\"currTime\":190,\"text\":\"Oh, it wasn't even human hair and the guy convicted on it.\"},{\"currTime\":194,\"text\":\"Do you know that in the guy, it's the Atlanta child killings, that guy, they only had him\"},{\"currTime\":200,\"text\":\"on carpet fibers.\"},{\"currTime\":201,\"text\":\"Holy shit.\"},{\"currTime\":202,\"text\":\"Which one's that?\"},{\"currTime\":203,\"text\":\"That's the one where there was tons of little kids in Atlanta, little black kids only that\"},{\"currTime\":208,\"text\":\"were getting murdered.\"},{\"currTime\":210,\"text\":\"And they had this guy and he is super suspicious because he was like, do you want to be a star?\"},{\"currTime\":215,\"text\":\"Posters all around the neighborhood and he had a recording studio, which is like textbook,\"},{\"currTime\":220,\"text\":\"like pedophilic entrapment stuff or also a way to get a star, a young star on the rise.\"},{\"currTime\":229,\"text\":\"But these kids were like getting dumped.\"},{\"currTime\":232,\"text\":\"They were getting murdered and then thrown into the river.\"},{\"currTime\":235,\"text\":\"So like, and then one night it was like connected to him because one night someone was near\"},{\"currTime\":242,\"text\":\"the bridge where a kid was rolled up in carpet and dumped over and then his car was spotted\"},{\"currTime\":247,\"text\":\"like somewhere nearby and they got him on it.\"},{\"currTime\":252,\"text\":\"But it was all about matching the carpet kid was wrapped up in to carpet somewhere else\"},{\"currTime\":259,\"text\":\"in the home or in the car.\"},{\"currTime\":261,\"text\":\"That's the same guy.\"},{\"currTime\":262,\"text\":\"Yeah, he like, there was a big piece of carpet cut out at his house?\"},{\"currTime\":266,\"text\":\"Yeah, I think so.\"},{\"currTime\":267,\"text\":\"I mean, now it's...\"},{\"currTime\":268,\"text\":\"That's pretty stupid, right?\"},{\"currTime\":269,\"text\":\"Yes.\"},{\"currTime\":270,\"text\":\"But the idea of that were because it's such a believable piece of evidence.\"},{\"currTime\":275,\"text\":\"Well, you know, another one is that's might be flawed, that is one of my favorite ways\"},{\"currTime\":280,\"text\":\"to collect evidence besides handwriting analysis is blood spatter evidence that they might\"},{\"currTime\":286,\"text\":\"totally debunk that too.\"},{\"currTime\":288,\"text\":\"Really?\"},{\"currTime\":289,\"text\":\"I feel like it's, I mean, yeah, I guess it doesn't have how do you scientifically prove\"},{\"currTime\":295,\"text\":\"those things?\"},{\"currTime\":296,\"text\":\"True.\"},{\"currTime\":297,\"text\":\"Every for every single time.\"},{\"currTime\":300,\"text\":\"Which of course puts me in the mind of the staircase where all that blood spatter and\"},{\"currTime\":305,\"text\":\"I mean, that was a big part of that documentary was all that.\"},{\"currTime\":309,\"text\":\"But are they saying that the science of how it lands and all that kind of stuff isn't\"},{\"currTime\":315,\"text\":\"real?\"},{\"currTime\":316,\"text\":\"Yeah, I mean, yeah, there's, you can't call it scientific evidence because it's not science.\"},{\"currTime\":323,\"text\":\"It's kind of like...\"},{\"currTime\":324,\"text\":\"Conjecture.\"},{\"currTime\":325,\"text\":\"It's like, yeah, and magic talk.\"},{\"currTime\":329,\"text\":\"But so when do they get to the part where they throw out owls?\"},{\"currTime\":333,\"text\":\"I feel like if you can use these things to get someone to confess, then great.\"},{\"currTime\":338,\"text\":\"But using it like the only thing to convict someone, that's insane.\"},{\"currTime\":343,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":344,\"text\":\"Well, but also I think it's fascinating, like the Memphis, West Memphis three, where you\"},{\"currTime\":352,\"text\":\"can get stupid people to confess very easily.\"},{\"currTime\":355,\"text\":\"Right, that's true.\"},{\"currTime\":356,\"text\":\"And those tactics, the other thing they need to reform is like keeping people in a room\"},{\"currTime\":362,\"text\":\"for 12 hours with no food and water and asking them the same question over and over and eventually\"},{\"currTime\":368,\"text\":\"having them just kind of go insane and want to be out of there.\"},{\"currTime\":372,\"text\":\"Yeah, and you lead the conversation.\"},{\"currTime\":375,\"text\":\"You convince them that they did it.\"},{\"currTime\":376,\"text\":\"They're not confessing because they want to get out of there sometimes.\"},{\"currTime\":378,\"text\":\"It's like, maybe I fucking didn't forgot.\"},{\"currTime\":380,\"text\":\"Yeah, they tell you all these possibilities.\"},{\"currTime\":382,\"text\":\"It's crazy.\"},{\"currTime\":383,\"text\":\"It is super crazy.\"},{\"currTime\":384,\"text\":\"However, if there's some fucking creepy ass dude and there's a missing blonde kid and\"},{\"currTime\":389,\"text\":\"they find a long blonde hair in his trunk, why would that long blonde hair be in there?\"},{\"currTime\":396,\"text\":\"Because he's a wig maker because his mother has long blonde hair because this.\"},{\"currTime\":400,\"text\":\"I mean, it's the kind of thing where it's like saying being creepy is illegal.\"},{\"currTime\":408,\"text\":\"That's the problem is that it's that thing of like you can't wear a black shirt, depending\"},{\"currTime\":412,\"text\":\"on which part of the country you live in, certain things aren't allowed culturally.\"},{\"currTime\":418,\"text\":\"That ties into my favorite murder today.\"},{\"currTime\":420,\"text\":\"Does it really?\"},{\"currTime\":421,\"text\":\"I want to hear your favorite.\"},{\"currTime\":422,\"text\":\"Let's tell each other our favorite murder.\"},{\"currTime\":424,\"text\":\"Okay.\"},{\"currTime\":425,\"text\":\"Wait, you don't want to use that natural segue to go into yours?\"},{\"currTime\":428,\"text\":\"I feel like then I would be talking too much.\"},{\"currTime\":430,\"text\":\"You know, this is a podcast, right?\"},{\"currTime\":434,\"text\":\"I'll go into mine.\"},{\"currTime\":436,\"text\":\"Get into talking.\"},{\"currTime\":437,\"text\":\"Mine.\"},{\"currTime\":438,\"text\":\"Okay.\"},{\"currTime\":439,\"text\":\"As a segue into mine is that he act this person had like Led Zeppelin and like Death\"},{\"currTime\":446,\"text\":\"Metal Band posters on the wall, so they were like he's, but I feel like it was early 90s.\"},{\"currTime\":452,\"text\":\"So this is my favorite murder is a man was tried and convicted and put to death for this\"},{\"currTime\":458,\"text\":\"murder.\"},{\"currTime\":459,\"text\":\"Oh shit.\"},{\"currTime\":460,\"text\":\"But it might probably isn't a murder in the first place.\"},{\"currTime\":464,\"text\":\"What?\"},{\"currTime\":465,\"text\":\"Have you heard of?\"},{\"currTime\":466,\"text\":\"Oh my God.\"},{\"currTime\":467,\"text\":\"His name.\"},{\"currTime\":468,\"text\":\"Have I not heard of this one?\"},{\"currTime\":469,\"text\":\"That I would.\"},{\"currTime\":470,\"text\":\"That's what I would love.\"},{\"currTime\":471,\"text\":\"His name is Cameron Todd Willingham in the early 90s.\"},{\"currTime\":477,\"text\":\"He busted out of his house that was engulfed in flames and his three little daughters died\"},{\"currTime\":483,\"text\":\"in it.\"},{\"currTime\":484,\"text\":\"Oh no.\"},{\"currTime\":485,\"text\":\"Have you heard of this one?\"},{\"currTime\":486,\"text\":\"No.\"},{\"currTime\":487,\"text\":\"It's like a big, it's a big case about like the Innocence Project and and debunking the\"},{\"currTime\":492,\"text\":\"arson, arson investigators testimony that ended up being just completely bullshit and\"},{\"currTime\":496,\"text\":\"wrong.\"},{\"currTime\":497,\"text\":\"Oh no.\"},{\"currTime\":498,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":499,\"text\":\"They had children that high stakes, we start out high stakes on this one.\"},{\"currTime\":502,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":503,\"text\":\"He was fucking budget death for this.\"},{\"currTime\":505,\"text\":\"Okay.\"},{\"currTime\":506,\"text\":\"Fuck Texas.\"},{\"currTime\":507,\"text\":\"Yes.\"},{\"currTime\":508,\"text\":\"Oh yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":509,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":510,\"text\":\"Don't mess.\"},{\"currTime\":511,\"text\":\"So yeah, he and they think that how it really started.\"},{\"currTime\":512,\"text\":\"So the arson investigators said that they found puddles where accelerant would have\"},{\"currTime\":516,\"text\":\"been and like the the outline of where the accelerant had been, you know, distributed\"},{\"currTime\":523,\"text\":\"around the apartment because or the

the the neighbors and the firefighters and all the people who initially got there\"},{\"currTime\":542,\"text\":\"said that he seemed so insanely distraught and was trying to get back into the

the 90s?\"},{\"currTime\":627,\"text\":\"Yes.\"},{\"currTime\":628,\"text\":\"91.\"},{\"currTime\":629,\"text\":\"Because when I was growing up, those pajamas were covered in stuff that caught on

it's the moralistic thing of, oh, no man, which kind of goes back to that, the\"},{\"currTime\":662,\"text\":\"thing that the last episode when we talked about would like, no man would let his

stuff?\"},{\"currTime\":702,\"text\":\"What is that about?\"},{\"currTime\":703,\"text\":\"There was like an Iron Maiden poster that had like a skull and crossbones on it and

his\"},{\"currTime\":1500,\"text\":\"stuff and they thought that they found a picture of one of the boys.\"},{\"currTime\":1505,\"text\":\"I think it was supposed to be Tim, the third one, screaming like a drawing of him with\"},{\"currTime\":1511,\"text\":\"his hoodie on because I think they said he was found in a hoodie or something.\"},{\"currTime\":1514,\"text\":\"So it was a picture of him with the hoodie looking like he was in total terror.\"},{\"currTime\":1520,\"text\":\"But they don't know for sure that that's who the face was, but that's what he looked like.\"},{\"currTime\":1524,\"text\":\"And so it was like, it was the circumstantial evidence.\"},{\"currTime\":1526,\"text\":\"That's such a small thing to go on though.\"},{\"currTime\":1528,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":1529,\"text\":\"They put all that together.\"},{\"currTime\":1530,\"text\":\"But apparently his room was really messy and filled with all kinds of creepy stuff.\"},{\"currTime\":1535,\"text\":\"And then one of the things that they connected, because apparently so that kid Christopher\"},{\"currTime\":1540,\"text\":\"Bush, they confiscated eight rolls of film in his room and it was all kiddie porn.\"},{\"currTime\":1549,\"text\":\"And then they find out, and this is the thing that stuff like this is what makes me so fascinated.\"},{\"currTime\":1556,\"text\":\"It piques my interest in it.\"},{\"currTime\":1558,\"text\":\"It's probably the writer in me where it's like, this is such a good story, separate from tragedy\"},{\"currTime\":1563,\"text\":\"or whatever.\"},{\"currTime\":1564,\"text\":\"They figure out that there is an island.\"},{\"currTime\":1569,\"text\":\"So I guess there's like an island chain up way north in the peninsula area of Michigan.\"},{\"currTime\":1574,\"text\":\"And one of them is called North Fox Island.\"},{\"currTime\":1577,\"text\":\"And it was empty, they thought.\"},{\"currTime\":1580,\"text\":\"And they find out that there is a Christian boys camp.\"},{\"currTime\":1585,\"text\":\"There's a camp like St. Somebody's for wayward boys on North Fox Island.\"},{\"currTime\":1592,\"text\":\"The only way to get on or off the island is by plane.\"},{\"currTime\":1596,\"text\":\"There's one airstrip down the center of it.\"},{\"currTime\":1598,\"text\":\"And when they go to investigate this island, they find out that they had set up this fake\"},{\"currTime\":1606,\"text\":\"boys camp to get boys like poor children who would sign up for a place like that.\"},{\"currTime\":1614,\"text\":\"It was like this free thing of like come.\"},{\"currTime\":1616,\"text\":\"And they were all being used in Kitty Porn.\"},{\"currTime\":1619,\"text\":\"It was just a Kitty Porn ring.\"},{\"currTime\":1620,\"text\":\"It was a Kitty Porn ring.\"},{\"currTime\":1621,\"text\":\"So then when they showed up, that's what was happening.\"},{\"currTime\":1624,\"text\":\"And it was Nightmare.\"},{\"currTime\":1625,\"text\":\"I mean, like, that's like a Friday the 13th Freddy Krueger Nightmare movie right there.\"},{\"currTime\":1632,\"text\":\"Which part of it do you obsess about?\"},{\"currTime\":1634,\"text\":\"The idea that these boys would be there thinking they get to go to camp and what that turns\"},{\"currTime\":1640,\"text\":\"into and then Nightmare that it would be on that island.\"},{\"currTime\":1644,\"text\":\"And also then when they go back because I was talking to somebody about that and they're\"},{\"currTime\":1648,\"text\":\"like, why wouldn't they say anything?\"},{\"currTime\":1649,\"text\":\"And I was like, I bet you these were the kids.\"},{\"currTime\":1652,\"text\":\"They were probably getting kids out of juvie or in situations where they don't have their\"},{\"currTime\":1656,\"text\":\"foster kids or like the most underrepresented.\"},{\"currTime\":1660,\"text\":\"And they're already wayward so no one believes these little shits because they get in so\"},{\"currTime\":1663,\"text\":\"much trouble.\"},{\"currTime\":1664,\"text\":\"Right.\"},{\"currTime\":1665,\"text\":\"Or they're paid.\"},{\"currTime\":1666,\"text\":\"And that turns out the guy that owns the island is this multi-millionaire.\"},{\"currTime\":1671,\"text\":\"That when they bust it, they find out and whatever.\"},{\"currTime\":1676,\"text\":\"They realize that this camp is there's no church affiliation.\"},{\"currTime\":1679,\"text\":\"There's no affiliation.\"},{\"currTime\":1680,\"text\":\"It's just these.\"},{\"currTime\":1682,\"text\":\"It's a pedophile ring that had also been operating in like the really bad part of Detroit that\"},{\"currTime\":1688,\"text\":\"was well known where like kids on the street, they would get kids and pay them and get them\"},{\"currTime\":1693,\"text\":\"into that ring and pay them to have sex with them.\"},{\"currTime\":1696,\"text\":\"And it was just this whole huge, ugly thing full on exploitation of poor children.\"},{\"currTime\":1703,\"text\":\"So that gets exposed in the in the baby civil killer investigation, which is amazing.\"},{\"currTime\":1710,\"text\":\"And then they they just I just read an article that they found a man.\"},{\"currTime\":1714,\"text\":\"So they had all these people that they suspected.\"},{\"currTime\":1718,\"text\":\"And they found a man named Ted Lambergine who they they got on kitty on those kitty\"},{\"currTime\":1728,\"text\":\"porn charges where he was definitely involved in that that there was like the ring that\"},{\"currTime\":1733,\"text\":\"they busted in the bad part of Detroit.\"},{\"currTime\":1739,\"text\":\"He was somehow definitely linked to it or whatever it was.\"},{\"currTime\":1743,\"text\":\"And then oh, and this was a thing where a prisoner, a detective from Detroit was out\"},{\"currTime\":1748,\"text\":\"in California interviewing someone about something else.\"},{\"currTime\":1751,\"text\":\"And then the prisoner was like, I know who your babysitter killer is and says it's Ted\"},{\"currTime\":1756,\"text\":\"Lambergine.\"},{\"currTime\":1757,\"text\":\"I knew him from this pedophile ring.\"},{\"currTime\":1759,\"text\":\"We'd all go and pay to fuck kids in Detroit, essentially.\"},{\"currTime\":1763,\"text\":\"And this guy told me he basically pointed to a picture and said, doesn't that look like\"},{\"currTime\":1768,\"text\":\"Tim, whoever, the third little boy?\"},{\"currTime\":1771,\"text\":\"And so that that detective went back and went and they started casing this guy who is now\"},{\"currTime\":1777,\"text\":\"70 and only leaves his house to go to church and da da da and like living like the silent\"},{\"currTime\":1783,\"text\":\"old man that no one knows anything about.\"},{\"currTime\":1785,\"text\":\"And then they go into his house and they find all this evidence.\"},{\"currTime\":1788,\"text\":\"And he will not admit that he was the babysitter killer, but he first all the evidence points\"},{\"currTime\":1794,\"text\":\"to it.\"},{\"currTime\":1795,\"text\":\"All the evidence points to that.\"},{\"currTime\":1796,\"text\":\"And he and they have him on all the pedophile charges and all the the ring charges and all\"},{\"currTime\":1801,\"text\":\"that.\"},{\"currTime\":1802,\"text\":\"Does he?\"},{\"currTime\":1803,\"text\":\"When did this happen?\"},{\"currTime\":1804,\"text\":\"When did he get busted?\"},{\"currTime\":1805,\"text\":\"2005.\"},{\"currTime\":1806,\"text\":\"Oh my God.\"},{\"currTime\":1807,\"text\":\"So and they, uh, oh Christopher Bush, the rich kid killed himself in 1978.\"},{\"currTime\":1814,\"text\":\"So they kind of like assumed it was him because there was all that weird evidence and stuff.\"},{\"currTime\":1820,\"text\":\"So then the Ted Lambergine thing, they like kind of came out of the blue.\"},{\"currTime\":1824,\"text\":\"Are we okay with Christopher Bush killing himself because he was a child molester or\"},{\"currTime\":1829,\"text\":\"do we not think that we're allowed to make that judgment call?\"},{\"currTime\":1833,\"text\":\"I mean, we can kind of do anything we want.\"},{\"currTime\":1836,\"text\":\"If that guy, if these people can pay children to rape them, we can make judgment calls on\"},{\"currTime\":1842,\"text\":\"these motherfuckers.\"},{\"currTime\":1843,\"text\":\"Like I never want to say I'm glad someone's dead, but it's probably for the best that\"},{\"currTime\":1847,\"text\":\"this person was harassed so much by the cops that he killed himself.\"},{\"currTime\":1850,\"text\":\"Well, yes, because, and also I bet you he killed himself for lots of other reasons.\"},{\"currTime\":1854,\"text\":\"Like in, in so far as that he lived a life where this terrible thing that he, a compulsion\"},{\"currTime\":1860,\"text\":\"he couldn't control was basically being okayed by his rich parents who didn't give enough\"},{\"currTime\":1865,\"text\":\"of a shit about him to take any real action.\"},{\"currTime\":1868,\"text\":\"So he was trapped in this weird world of money.\"},{\"currTime\":1871,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":1872,\"text\":\"I mean, I think that's also really fascinating too of like you, that's a person that gets\"},{\"currTime\":1876,\"text\":\"to do whatever they want because of money.\"},{\"currTime\":1878,\"text\":\"Same as those people at the North Fox Island.\"},{\"currTime\":1881,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":1882,\"text\":\"So like, what did that guy get?\"},{\"currTime\":1883,\"text\":\"Those people all disappeared.\"},{\"currTime\":1885,\"text\":\"The guy that owned the island, they escaped to Europe.\"},{\"currTime\":1889,\"text\":\"Holy shit.\"},{\"currTime\":1890,\"text\":\"Like flew, left the island, flew away and they just couldn't find him or extradite him.\"},{\"currTime\":1895,\"text\":\"Money.\"},{\"currTime\":1896,\"text\":\"I love that, that, that was this island that no one thought, you just take it over.\"},{\"currTime\":1900,\"text\":\"Who's going to fucking know?\"},{\"currTime\":1901,\"text\":\"Right.\"},{\"currTime\":1902,\"text\":\"And build an entire camp there.\"},{\"currTime\":1903,\"text\":\"A fake church camp.\"},{\"currTime\":1905,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":1906,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":1907,\"text\":\"It's, I mean, to me, like pedophiles and kiddie porn, that kind of shit is the darkest.\"},{\"currTime\":1913,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":1914,\"text\":\"I like serial killers that just kill random people, obviously not good.\"},{\"currTime\":1917,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":1918,\"text\":\"But that kind of stuff.\"},{\"currTime\":1919,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":1920,\"text\":\"Where you, what is wrong

specifically to helpless people who can't make any decisions about what, you know, you\"},{\"currTime\":1938,\"text\":\"know, control.\"},{\"currTime\":1939,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":1940,\"text\":\"You don't think the way you do as an adult when you're a kid, you don't understand

that, it's exploitation.\"},{\"currTime\":1948,\"text\":\"It's just the dark, it's the darkest to me.\"},{\"currTime\":1950,\"text\":\"It's like the closest thing to real

too.\"},{\"currTime\":1959,\"text\":\"So they're arresting the 70 year old and that's how it's ending.\"},{\"currTime\":1961,\"text\":\"Well they, they got him on the other charges, but they can't get him.\"},{\"currTime\":1966,\"text\":\"They don't have enough heart evidence on those murders, but they're positive.\"},{\"currTime\":1970,\"text\":\"They lined up because he also, the murder stopped when he moved to Cleveland.\"},{\"currTime\":1975,\"text\":\"And when he moved to Cleveland, he started going to church every day and they think that\"},{\"currTime\":1979,\"text\":\"the priest there

very clear and it was like the days\"},{\"currTime\":1989,\"text\":\"he wasn't at work or the days the children disappeared.\"},{\"currTime\":1993,\"text\":\"All kinds of stuff.\"},{\"currTime\":1994,\"text\":\"Those are always so interesting to me or like finding out that someone, you know, had someone\"},{\"currTime\":1997,\"text\":\"clock in for them, even though they were, they have an alibi and it turns out it's\"},{\"currTime\":2001,\"text\":\"total bullshit and here's how they know and I just, it's so fascinating the detective\"},{\"currTime\":2005,\"text\":\"work that he takes to find that.\"},{\"currTime\":2008,\"text\":\"And also those poor detectives, like the way your life gets affected by having to go and\"},{\"currTime\":2013,\"text\":\"investigate these people.\"},{\"currTime\":2015,\"text\":\"I mean, nothing justifies the crazy murdering that's happening on the street of most

her.\"},{\"currTime\":2044,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":2045,\"text\":\"It's the depravity of like a child, rapist, murderer, coming face to face with the actual\"},{\"currTime\":2050,\"text\":\"evil thing, which you and I probably never will unless we search it out, but these detectives\"},{\"currTime\":2054,\"text\":\"would knock on one, but these people have to then delve as deep as they can into it\"},{\"currTime\":2060,\"text\":\"and all the facts and not kill them so that they can be brought to justice and have some\"},{\"currTime\":2066,\"text\":\"jailhouse justice and just get killed terribly in jail.\"},{\"currTime\":2070,\"text\":\"That's the ideal.\"},{\"currTime\":2071,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":2073,\"text\":\"Then getting even arrested is a small, you know, can't be a huge percentage of them.\"},{\"currTime\":2077,\"text\":\"So even getting someone arrested has to be hard.\"},{\"currTime\":2080,\"text\":\"So imagine retiring after never having solved this case.\"},{\"currTime\":2084,\"text\":\"No, that's terrible.\"},{\"currTime\":2086,\"text\":\"I know.\"},{\"currTime\":2087,\"text\":\"And it ruins people's lives to go investigate this stuff and to discover this like, it's\"},{\"currTime\":2092,\"text\":\"just the seamy underside.\"},{\"currTime\":2096,\"text\":\"And I only, I surfed it on Wikipedia and was just mesmerized by how horrifying it

related.\"},{\"currTime\":2106,\"text\":\"That's not like an, like anyways, children are dead.\"},{\"currTime\":2109,\"text\":\"That's not how I meant.\"},{\"currTime\":2110,\"text\":\"But how this,

this, with the whole France bombing, people\"},{\"currTime\":2136,\"text\":\"talking about going to war again, where I was like, how many, we don't have that many\"},{\"currTime\":2141,\"text\":\"more

them.\"},{\"currTime\":2167,\"text\":\"But there's, it's still bad.\"},{\"currTime\":2168,\"text\":\"I know there's plenty of people or it's just, it's still a horrific

    "transcript_text": " This is exactly right. We at Wondery live, breathe, and downright obsess over true crime. And now we're launching the ultimate true crime fan experience, Exhibit C. Join now by following Wondery, Exhibit C, on Facebook and listen to true crime on Wondery and Amazon Music. Exhibit C, it's truly criminal. How do we start talking about murder? I don't know. Hey Karen, how was your day? It was pretty good. Did you get murdered? I did, and I lived through today. How about yourself? Didn't get murdered. See, that's all we want. Yeah. That's all anyone wants. We're helping people not get murdered. I bet people did get murdered today, though. Like a lot of people. Yeah. Yeah. RIP to those people. Yeah. We're sorry your time ended. It'll start again soon enough. Well, the day's not over yet, either, so. That's right. I have to walk to my car. Yeah. I'm like, Dory is locked, because of course it is. No invasion robbery, big fear of mine. Is it really? Uh-huh. Yeah, around here, that's a reasonable fear. Yeah. Except for when you have people close by. Yeah. That's a great thing. Do you know you're across the hall neighbors? Yeah, they're nice. They like me. Great. But a couple nights ago, I was thinking about how someone could break in here, and I was thinking about how they could parkour up the wall and into my balcony. Like you're some parkouring criminal. You're afraid to get murdered by Spider-Man? Yeah. That would be. Yeah. You're the one person who murders instead of Steve. All right. That would be a bummer. This is my favorite murder. I'm Georgia. I'm Karen. Let's start with a new piece of news based on murdery stuff. Okay, good. Okay, so you know how, Karen, you know how one of the many ways that you can collect and present evidence is by matching hair follicles from the scene to the person or the murder or whatever. Yep. That's a completely bunk science. No. Yes. And the Justice Department is acknowledging that nearly every examiner at an elite FBI forensic unit gave flawed testimony in almost all trials in which they offered evidence against criminal defendants over more than two decade period. No. 95% of the 268 trials viewed so far says that they overstated forensic matches. Holy, no, this is humongous. I know because I've seen shows where they do this and I'm like, great, legit. That's crazy. Every, I feel like every forensic files that I've seen, it's right and they're like pulling up those like the microscopic things, the slides. And you see the ridges and you see the color. It turns out in one of the cases, it turned out to be dog hair that they found. Oh, it wasn't even human hair and the guy convicted on it. Do you know that in the guy, it's the Atlanta child killings, that guy, they only had him on carpet fibers. Holy shit. Which one's that? That's the one where there was tons of little kids in Atlanta, little black kids only that were getting murdered. And they had this guy and he is super suspicious because he was like, do you want to be a star? Posters all around the neighborhood and he had a recording studio, which is like textbook, like pedophilic entrapment stuff or also a way to get a star, a young star on the rise. But these kids were like getting dumped. They were getting murdered and then thrown into the river. So like, and then one night it was like connected to him because one night someone was near the bridge where a kid was rolled up in carpet and dumped over and then his car was spotted like somewhere nearby and they got him on it. But it was all about matching the carpet kid was wrapped up in to carpet somewhere else in the home or in the car. That's the same guy. Yeah, he like, there was a big piece of carpet cut out at his house? Yeah, I think so. I mean, now it's... That's pretty stupid, right? Yes. But the idea of that were because it's such a believable piece of evidence. Well, you know, another one is that's might be flawed, that is one of my favorite ways to collect evidence besides handwriting analysis is blood spatter evidence that they might totally debunk that too. Really? I feel like it's, I mean, yeah, I guess it doesn't have how do you scientifically prove those things? True. Every for every single time. Which of course puts me in the mind of the staircase where all that blood spatter and I mean, that was a big part of that documentary was all that. But are they saying that the science of how it lands and all that kind of stuff isn't real? Yeah, I mean, yeah, there's, you can't call it scientific evidence because it's not science. It's kind of like... Conjecture. It's like, yeah, and magic talk. But so when do they get to the part where they throw out owls? I feel like if you can use these things to get someone to confess, then great. But using it like the only thing to convict someone, that's insane. Yeah. Well, but also I think it's fascinating, like the Memphis, West Memphis three, where you can get stupid people to confess very easily. Right, that's true. And those tactics, the other thing they need to reform is like keeping people in a room for 12 hours with no food and water and asking them the same question over and over and eventually having them just kind of go insane and want to be out of there. Yeah, and you lead the conversation. You convince them that they did it. They're not confessing because they want to get out of there sometimes. It's like, maybe I fucking didn't forgot. Yeah, they tell you all these possibilities. It's crazy. It is super crazy. However, if there's some fucking creepy ass dude and there's a missing blonde kid and they find a long blonde hair in his trunk, why would that long blonde hair be in there? Because he's a wig maker because his mother has long blonde hair because this. I mean, it's the kind of thing where it's like saying being creepy is illegal. That's the problem is that it's that thing of like you can't wear a black shirt, depending on which part of the country you live in, certain things aren't allowed culturally. That ties into my favorite murder today. Does it really? I want to hear your favorite. Let's tell each other our favorite murder. Okay. Wait, you don't want to use that natural segue to go into yours? I feel like then I would be talking too much. You know, this is a podcast, right? I'll go into mine. Get into talking. Mine. Okay. As a segue into mine is that he act this person had like Led Zeppelin and like Death Metal Band posters on the wall, so they were like he's, but I feel like it was early 90s. So this is my favorite murder is a man was tried and convicted and put to death for this murder. Oh shit. But it might probably isn't a murder in the first place. What? Have you heard of? Oh my God. His name. Have I not heard of this one? That I would. That's what I would love. His name is Cameron Todd Willingham in the early 90s. He busted out of his house that was engulfed in flames and his three little daughters died in it. Oh no. Have you heard of this one? No. It's like a big, it's a big case about like the Innocence Project and and debunking the arson, arson investigators testimony that ended up being just completely bullshit and wrong. Oh no. Yeah. They had children that high stakes, we start out high stakes on this one. Yeah. He was fucking budget death for this. Okay. Fuck Texas. Yes. Oh yeah. Yeah. Don't mess. So yeah, he and they think that how it really started. So the arson investigators said that they found puddles where accelerant would have been and like the the outline of where the accelerant had been, you know, distributed around the apartment because or the house because the burns don't happen this way. And this is what fires do and here's, you know, we've been studying this for years and years. Right. But we all saw back draft. Right. Exactly. So it turns out that that's just bullshit. And the the neighbors and the firefighters and all the people who initially got there said that he seemed so insanely distraught and was trying to get back into the house, but he couldn't because it was on fire. And then they later changed their testimony and he'd be like, yeah, he was too upset. I think it was fake. And no, he didn't seem upset at all. He moved his car and then they said he moved his, he said he moved his car. So it wouldn't explode and add to the fire in the cotton fire. Right. I don't know. But maybe he's guilty though. I mean, maybe, but so sorry, would he be guilty of wanting his family dead? Just like it was his wife gone. His wife was gone at the time and he said he was sleeping and heard his daughter say daddy and he and it was already smoke, heavy smoke. So he left the house with the children inside. He tried. He tried to get to them, but the fire had originated in their bedroom. The children? Yes. So he couldn't get to them and he tried to go back in. He tried breaking windows. I know. See, I was like of one mind when you started this story, that just turned me hard. Well, here's what they say probably happened. And I kind of can see this and believe it that they're, they used space heaters. Yes. Those things are deadly. Yeah. They're like blanky space heaters that literally are on fire. The daughter liked to lay near it and fuck with it. And her fucking blanky probably caught on fire. And her cheap Kmart polyester pajamas. Yes. Yes. Wait, this was the 90s? Yes. 91. Because when I was growing up, those pajamas were covered in stuff that caught on fire. Yeah. How are we not dead from the 80s and 90s? It's a miracle. It's like anyone that's my age is a total kind of just a walking miracle. Yeah. That we got to this point. Well, it's no, you got left home alone all the time. Can you imagine having a kid and watching them fucking run full throttle into death? Fuck. Well, here's the thing. It's that thing. Like it's the moralistic thing of, oh, no man, which kind of goes back to that, the thing that the last episode when we talked about would like, no man would let his wife get raped in front of her more and more. It makes me want to say that of like, no man would leave a house where his three children are burning. Right. But the instinct to get out, to live, and the heat, the amount of heat, I mean, think of like the last time you cooked something and like the pan was hot and you touched a pan. Yeah. That's what the walls would have been like if the house is on fire. I mean, in reading his account, it sounds like it was, it was already up in smoke. And he came out, got a breath and tried to go back in, but just it was walls and black smoke and you couldn't get in. What's the poster, like the metal posters and stuff? What is that about? There was like an Iron Maiden poster that had like a skull and crossbones on it and they're like, he's Satanic and he's a sociopath and here's the proof because he has a like a sword and a heart tattoo on his arm. So he's in the cultism and Satanism and it's just that kind of small, that small town shit, you know, in the nineties. And now that would be anyone, if you went to intelligentsia right now, it's like, oh, so this whole place is filled with satanists, although I have a feeling like there's places in this country where you could still get, you know, that's evidence towards you being a murderer still. Yeah. For sure. And God, we don't live there. And also think of how creepy it would be if you were the fire investigator and you were walking through a burnt house and you see, but because that's those people, they're just people and they're just civil servants. So like they go in and see dead children in a room, their first responders. That's a huge emotional reaction. They look up and see a pentagram poster or whatever the thing is. And they're not thinking, let's not be reactionary or whatever, they're just human beings going, this whole thing looks like living hell. Yeah. Or look at this pentagram, let's look for accelerant traces and you can find them if you look. Or, you know, I can't remember how they explained away the accelerant, maybe that, oh, they didn't say something weird that I was like, meh, that there was accelerant in the doorframe. Yeah. Like lighter fluid. And when the firefighters came, there was a barbecue grill on the porch. Maybe that's, it got blasted off and that's how the lighter fluid got there, which sounds like a lot of fishy, but what could happen? It totally, and also it doesn't sound like they, they didn't, it wasn't like they're running a tight ship over there. Right. Right. It doesn't sound like it. If you have shitty old space heaters. Yeah. The, probably the rest of your house is like a lot of random paper towels in bad places and stuff. Right. I mean. Oh, there was a refrigerator blocking the second door and the kitchen, all this, you know, it's like. But my dad used to talk all the time because my dad was a San Francisco fireman and he would talk constantly about how stupid people were about stuff like at Christmas when they're, they would not water their tree, cover it in lights, leave the lights on all night and people and then, and everything's next to old curtains or like the people don't even realize or like, I'll just take the time right now to tell everybody, clean out the lint trap in your dryer. Every time you do a load of dry, every time you dry a load, because that's the number one way people's houses catch on fire. Wow. You know, when you pull off like that big crazy sweater of lint trap, because it's so much fun. And it's the, right. And it's like a big thing, but that's how people's houses catch on fire. Also battery. I heard the thing about batteries, if you leave like a deep battery out and near another one, they can spark somehow together and light on fire. Is that true? Because you have to like, jeez, dispose of them in the most like crazy way. Yeah. I worry all the time. I know. Well, and some people don't at all. I know. And that's why shit, like that happens. They're just like, you know, we'll see what happens, but that's fucked up three little kids died because of that. Yeah. Either way. And in the beginning, his wife was like, he's absolutely innocent on his side later. She divorced him and kind of went back and forth between if he was innocent or guilty. In the end, when he was put to death, she thought he was guilty, but she went back and forth a couple of times. How could you not? And also it's not, you didn't lose one child. You lost all of your children. And now there's a, there's kind of a backlash because there was a, there was a prison informant that he shared a cell with who's now, who, who testified that this, this Cameron willing guy confessed to the murders, but now it's coming that he actually had been like paid with money and less jail time to testify. Yep. And, yeah. Jailhouse tests, like it's also in, how do you ever go, no, this guy's really telling the truth. This time though. This one is trustworthy. This is it. Cause it perfectly fits our investigation and what we need to hear right now and now we have the information. I have a hard time when, like in this article that I was reading, it's not in the New Yorker. It's called trial by fire. They were saying that like his parole officer had said how nice and sweet he was, which I, I can never, sociopaths are the nicest, most charming people you'll ever meet. So I don't believe any that. I don't give a shit about nice. Nice does not qualify for anything with me cause it's the easiest way to be. Nice is not a big deal. I don't like charming. I'm creeped out by charming people. Yeah. Well, they want something. Right. I mean, everybody does, but like if you're going to be, if you're going to put the energy behind being charming, then there's something going on. There's an agenda at play. Also, if you feel like you need to please every single person that you meet, you've got a fucking emotional mental issue that. Yeah. There's something going on. Right. I mean, truly at the end of the day, give me an asshole and I don't mean that the way you think and want me to mean it. I didn't think about it until this now. But yeah. But you know what? Did you stand by that? I would stand by it at every interpretation, no, of just like people who are self-possessed enough to not care what other people think or need them, need to manipulate what other people think. That's what it is. It's like, I'm going to make you think this certain thing about me. That's where, that's the problematic thing. That scares me so much that I just don't ever believe anyone until I know them well enough. But I think that's the healthiest way. Because I remember being in my 20s and getting tricked by plenty of people who I'm sure were sociopaths or just deep narcissists. And you kind of, I think, eventually you learn, you know, you just start picking up on those signs and that's a good thing. That's what we're supposed to do. This is my therapy session. This is it. Let's like, let's do half murder, half, half kind of a psychological analysis of how to be. It's all intertwined. Isn't it? We should tell everyone these, I mean, who else are they going to hear from? Right. Yeah, listen to us. This is kind of a DIY how to live. It's a lifestyle podcast. Let's get that lifestyle. With the murder theme. Right. Um... Lifestyle, death style. Yeah. How to decorate your murder. There's four DIY ways to decorate your murder. Splatter, splatter, splatter. It might not be a viable way to approve a case, but it still looks great on the wall. Put your hair everywhere because they can't convict you now with that. They can't do shit about it. Put your carpet fibers where you want. What makes a person a murderer? Are they born to kill or are they made to kill?

My favorite murder this week is one that I've been so excited to talk about because this was one of those ones where I went deep Wikipedia one night alone and it was too late at night and often there are not very many friends I have that I can be like, guess what? Guess what about these children that were murdered in the late 70s? Until I met you. Yeah. We're the only people that won't text back. Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? What's really going on? Yeah. So there were these four kids who were murdered in Oakland County, Michigan in the late 70s and this whole case was called the Oakland County Child Killings. Sounds fucking awesome already. So they found a 12-year-old boy kidnapped and raped and smothered and that was the first one and then like a week later at these, I didn't write down, I didn't do my super accurate homework. Listen, the people are coming here for facts that are in the wrong fucking place. Yeah. And also it's all off Wikipedia so you can get it and really, really enjoy it for yourself firsthand but essentially all 11 and 12-year-old children and so it goes boy and then a 12-year-old girl was found kidnapped, not raped, bathed, fed and then shot point blank and left in the snow. How was the first kid killed? Smothered. Smothered. So those aren't the same murderer probably? Well, they probably didn't connect them then but then the third kid who was an 11-year-old boy who was kidnapped and so he was gone for like, he disappeared and so on say the 7th day or whatever, the parents went on the news and said please bring him home so we can give him his favorite dinner, Kentucky Fried Chicken, that thing they do to personalize and the next day they found his body. Don't tell me he had Kentucky Fried Chicken in his belly. It smothered with Kentucky Fried Chicken left in his belly. No. Exactly what you didn't want to hear. Oh my God. And he was also washed like the girl was, his nails were trimmed, his clothes were spotless, they were washed and pressed and his body was still warm when they found him. So that's when they knew something super terrible was happening. And then the last girl was 11 and she disappeared, just kidnapped and then she was found murdered. So the girls were not sexually interfered with and the boys were raped. So that was just, that was like a big thing that happened and they called, so after they got all that information they called him the babysitter killer, which is, it's fucked up and almost sweet to him. Because the way he treated the kids. Well, because of the way he left them, which kind of implies the way he treated them was nice except for, we all know that's not true and imagine. Because he kept them for a while, which is the nightmare part. Alive. Alive. So, yeah. So that's horrifying. I feel like when you're alive there's some chance of escape, like there's some hope left. Yes. Well, it's still happening for sure. But then it's just that thing of like, it goes to the total insanity and, I don't know. Depravity. I wish I knew the difference. Yes, depravity for sure. But like when you're really psychotic or whatever, where you're keeping the thing, you're going to murder. Like you know this is all the plan and so you're keeping a child like a pet or whatever. It's just beyond. But when they started looking at the suspects that were around Oakland County, one of the people, and this is where I went down the hole, one of the people that was a suspect was like a 24-year-old rich kid and his name, oh shit, I'm not going to find it, dang it. Christopher Bush. So his father was like either the GM or the vice president of one of the huge motor companies. Wait, it might have been GM and his father was the vice president of GM or one of those ones. Hugely rich. He was always in this big mansion by himself. His parents were always like working or on vacation or whatever. And there was a constant stream of young boys coming in and out of the house. Because he was a child monster. So he was paying kids to come over and whatever. And so he got arrested for sexual assault and child molestation several times. Like he was a known pedophile. How the fuck those people stay out? Because he was rich. So they always bought him out of jail and cleared him and whatever and tried to do Stephanie. So they went and found him and started looking through his room and looking through all his stuff and they thought that they found a picture of one of the boys. I think it was supposed to be Tim, the third one, screaming like a drawing of him with his hoodie on because I think they said he was found in a hoodie or something. So it was a picture of him with the hoodie looking like he was in total terror. But they don't know for sure that that's who the face was, but that's what he looked like. And so it was like, it was the circumstantial evidence. That's such a small thing to go on though. Yeah. They put all that together. But apparently his room was really messy and filled with all kinds of creepy stuff. And then one of the things that they connected, because apparently so that kid Christopher Bush, they confiscated eight rolls of film in his room and it was all kiddie porn. And then they find out, and this is the thing that stuff like this is what makes me so fascinated. It piques my interest in it. It's probably the writer in me where it's like, this is such a good story, separate from tragedy or whatever. They figure out that there is an island. So I guess there's like an island chain up way north in the peninsula area of Michigan. And one of them is called North Fox Island. And it was empty, they thought. And they find out that there is a Christian boys camp. There's a camp like St. Somebody's for wayward boys on North Fox Island. The only way to get on or off the island is by plane. There's one airstrip down the center of it. And when they go to investigate this island, they find out that they had set up this fake boys camp to get boys like poor children who would sign up for a place like that. It was like this free thing of like come. And they were all being used in Kitty Porn. It was just a Kitty Porn ring. It was a Kitty Porn ring. So then when they showed up, that's what was happening. And it was Nightmare. I mean, like, that's like a Friday the 13th Freddy Krueger Nightmare movie right there. Which part of it do you obsess about? The idea that these boys would be there thinking they get to go to camp and what that turns into and then Nightmare that it would be on that island. And also then when they go back because I was talking to somebody about that and they're like, why wouldn't they say anything? And I was like, I bet you these were the kids. They were probably getting kids out of juvie or in situations where they don't have their foster kids or like the most underrepresented. And they're already wayward so no one believes these little shits because they get in so much trouble. Right. Or they're paid. And that turns out the guy that owns the island is this multi-millionaire. That when they bust it, they find out and whatever. They realize that this camp is there's no church affiliation. There's no affiliation. It's just these. It's a pedophile ring that had also been operating in like the really bad part of Detroit that was well known where like kids on the street, they would get kids and pay them and get them into that ring and pay them to have sex with them. And it was just this whole huge, ugly thing full on exploitation of poor children. So that gets exposed in the in the baby civil killer investigation, which is amazing. And then they they just I just read an article that they found a man. So they had all these people that they suspected. And they found a man named Ted Lambergine who they they got on kitty on those kitty porn charges where he was definitely involved in that that there was like the ring that they busted in the bad part of Detroit. He was somehow definitely linked to it or whatever it was. And then oh, and this was a thing where a prisoner, a detective from Detroit was out in California interviewing someone about something else. And then the prisoner was like, I know who your babysitter killer is and says it's Ted Lambergine. I knew him from this pedophile ring. We'd all go and pay to fuck kids in Detroit, essentially. And this guy told me he basically pointed to a picture and said, doesn't that look like Tim, whoever, the third little boy? And so that that detective went back and went and they started casing this guy who is now 70 and only leaves his house to go to church and da da da and like living like the silent old man that no one knows anything about. And then they go into his house and they find all this evidence. And he will not admit that he was the babysitter killer, but he first all the evidence points to it. All the evidence points to that. And he and they have him on all the pedophile charges and all the the ring charges and all that. Does he? When did this happen? When did he get busted? 2005. Oh my God. So and they, uh, oh Christopher Bush, the rich kid killed himself in 1978. So they kind of like assumed it was him because there was all that weird evidence and stuff. So then the Ted Lambergine thing, they like kind of came out of the blue. Are we okay with Christopher Bush killing himself because he was a child molester or do we not think that we're allowed to make that judgment call? I mean, we can kind of do anything we want. If that guy, if these people can pay children to rape them, we can make judgment calls on these motherfuckers. Like I never want to say I'm glad someone's dead, but it's probably for the best that this person was harassed so much by the cops that he killed himself. Well, yes, because, and also I bet you he killed himself for lots of other reasons. Like in, in so far as that he lived a life where this terrible thing that he, a compulsion he couldn't control was basically being okayed by his rich parents who didn't give enough of a shit about him to take any real action. So he was trapped in this weird world of money. Yeah. I mean, I think that's also really fascinating too of like you, that's a person that gets to do whatever they want because of money. Same as those people at the North Fox Island. Yeah. So like, what did that guy get? Those people all disappeared. The guy that owned the island, they escaped to Europe. Holy shit. Like flew, left the island, flew away and they just couldn't find him or extradite him. Money. I love that, that, that was this island that no one thought, you just take it over. Who's going to fucking know? Right. And build an entire camp there. A fake church camp. Yeah. Yeah. It's, I mean, to me, like pedophiles and kiddie porn, that kind of shit is the darkest. Yeah. I like serial killers that just kill random people, obviously not good. Yeah. But that kind of stuff. Yeah. Where you, what is wrong with that person where that's, they're not just doing the wrong thing, but they're, they're loving doing the wrong thing. And specifically to helpless people who can't make any decisions about what, you know, you know, control. Yeah. You don't think the way you do as an adult when you're a kid, you don't understand what's happening to you. Yeah. It's, it's super ugly. And it's like that, it's exploitation. It's just the dark, it's the darkest to me. It's like the closest thing to real monsters. Those people are real monsters. Definitely. Kind of a bummer though too. So they're arresting the 70 year old and that's how it's ending. Well they, they got him on the other charges, but they can't get him. They don't have enough heart evidence on those murders, but they're positive. They lined up because he also, the murder stopped when he moved to Cleveland. And when he moved to Cleveland, he started going to church every day and they think that the priest there knows, like they think he confessed to the priest and the priest isn't saying it. They, there's all kinds of things like that that are very clear and it was like the days he wasn't at work or the days the children disappeared. All kinds of stuff. Those are always so interesting to me or like finding out that someone, you know, had someone clock in for them, even though they were, they have an alibi and it turns out it's total bullshit and here's how they know and I just, it's so fascinating the detective work that he takes to find that. And also those poor detectives, like the way your life gets affected by having to go and investigate these people. I mean, nothing justifies the crazy murdering that's happening on the street of most black people today in America. I will never, I never, ever mean anything is justified in that way. What I mean is that when you, like as a detective, when you have to visit time and again, people who are depraved. So it's not just crime or like, I'm desperate and on drugs and so I'm doing this thing. A fight with my wife and killed her. Yeah. It's the depravity of like a child, rapist, murderer, coming face to face with the actual evil thing, which you and I probably never will unless we search it out, but these detectives would knock on one, but these people have to then delve as deep as they can into it and all the facts and not kill them so that they can be brought to justice and have some jailhouse justice and just get killed terribly in jail. That's the ideal. Yeah. Then getting even arrested is a small, you know, can't be a huge percentage of them. So even getting someone arrested has to be hard. So imagine retiring after never having solved this case. No, that's terrible. I know. And it ruins people's lives to go investigate this stuff and to discover this like, it's just the seamy underside. And I only, I surfed it on Wikipedia and was just mesmerized by how horrifying it is. Are you watching the new season of Fargo? Oh, yes. This is related. That's not like an, like anyways, children are dead. That's not how I meant. But how this, the cop in it is, went to war and is now seeing all this insane stuff at home. Yes. And the, what the toilet must take on you to have gone to war and seen shit that you would never tell anyone about and then come home and do that too as a cop? Yes. Which is how it happens a lot of the time. I just started thinking about the fact that this, with the whole France bombing, people talking about going to war again, where I was like, how many, we don't have that many more men left that this country hasn't ravaged. Who do they think they're going to send to war? Right. Who's going to, yeah, the people who are going to, yeah, enlist or have already enlisted right? Yeah. And, and yeah, and then how do you, I mean, there are plenty of people who come home and make lives, but they're probably the people that didn't have super terrible things happen to them. But there's, it's still bad. I know there's plenty of people or it's just, it's still a horrific experience. Yeah. I love that TV show so much. It's so amazing. Fargo, this season is fucking out of control. It's so cinematic. That's gorgeous. It's crazy. And I love that Native American. She's a doll. He's. Kirsten Dunstall is, I would just watch a whole thing of her day. Yeah. She's so funny in it. Well, and also that it finally came together of her and all those magazines, which I never paid attention to before the stacks of magazines everywhere. I didn't think that she wants to escape. Is that what it's for? Yes. Okay. Like when she finally sat down with Ted Dunstall and they started talking, these are spoiler alert. Right. She's like, here's why I have this obsession is because I'm not supposed to fucking be here. Yeah. Yeah. And then that, that's his childhood home. Yes. But they live in, and how fucking depressing to just live your whole life in the same house. Yes. And there's some people that are happy with that and want it. And then if there's some people who just dream of going to California, I know, it's amazing. Why do I think it is so much easier than it is now to like break away and do that? Because you can get, because you can't get traced. You could go and change your fucking identity. Yeah, probably. Yeah. And there's one part where she was on the bus and I was like, oh, she's out of there. This, you were not going to see Kristen Dunst anymore. And she said, here's the thing, Kristen Dunst is one of the most brilliant actresses of our time. And no one knows. I am, I was very surprised to like her this much in it. When I saw her, I was like, okay, here we go, but fuck, she's so good. Well, because I saw her and I thought, oh, this is going to be like a quote unquote comeback thing. But she is, every person in that cast is brilliant and she's equally brilliant. I agree. I'm proud of her. I am too. We're, we're definitely ending it on an up next. Are we? I think we are. Oh, should be, I have Tom Sibley's death story. Oh, yes. That's a great, so. Should we play that? Yes. Okay. All right. We're going to explain. You explain. So I think we said this in our last episode, but we want to hear other people's stories of like murders that they grew up with or things that happened in their hometown or the one like murder story you tell of, right, from your hometown or the thing that you know. And so this was, we were all at our friend Matt McCarthy's birthday party and Georgia was smart enough to ask our friend Tom Sibley, who's a comic and a lover of wrestling as is our Vincent Matt. From the Feral Audio podcast, we watch wrestling. Yeah. Of course. So this is his hometown murder story. Yeah. Okay. This is Tom Sibley. My murder story is where my parents live. I'm not going to say where they live. It's an island in New Jersey and there was a guy that everyone used for their upholster. He made really good couch cushions, especially for outdoor furniture, like outdoor cushions. Everyone has his stuff and he killed his mother because he lived with his mother and he killed her and he kept her like in the house for months and like no one knew where his mother was and et cetera, et cetera later on it came out that he had killed her and was just kind of keeping her body in the house. How did he kill her? I'm not sure. I think it may have been strangulation. And oh, I love it all because we everyone has the cushions of this guy. He was the go-to guy for cushions and like I was just sitting on those cushions like a week ago and but it was the cushions of a mother murder. So everyone kept the cushions after they found out they were like, well, they're good cushions. Thank you Tom Sibley. Thank you. Did you? When I listened back to that tonight earlier, I realized that when he said like he was there was this thing and there was this guy and he murdered his mother and you could hear me in the background crack up. I think it's just like giddy glee at the story. Yes. Yes. That's fucking like most people who are not you would be like, what the fuck? Did you just laugh at him killing his mom because you know what it is? It's like this is the shit. People walk around all day going like, would you watch on TV last night and can you believe this weather? It's not so warm, but at the end of the day, people are murdering people and doing extreme and same things. The second he said made couch cushions, I started laughing because if for some reason and maybe it's because the hillside stranglers, the one of them was an upholsterer, I think so. I think that's why where it came from. I'm not sure, but their upholstery is something to do with it, but something about that is so sinister to me. It's like there's tools that are very violent in upholstery and I thought it was, yeah, that's a really good one. Plus, I love that everyone has one of these stories and no one ever asks them these stories. Yes. They'll never tell them. Right. Unless you- Everyone has one of these stories and it's just because it's like the thing that freaked you out. Yeah. There's always something freaky and insane. Yeah. Should I end it on that? I think so. Okay. Is there anything else? No, I don't know. You want to add anything? I don't know. Just try to be nice to people. Yeah. People don't get murdered. People you don't really know until you see in the grocery store line. That sucks for them. And also just for yourself, be excited that you're not murdered yet and enjoy yourself. Do what you want. Do what like you're someone's telling you you have to do because there's no have to because you never know what could happen. You never know. This is really- I mean, when it comes down to it, this is a positive podcast where we're trying to lift people out. Yeah. And make them their best selves. And sometimes you lift, we lift each other up by pushing down the murdered. Yeah. It's as if to say, it's a celebration of life. Yeah. L'chaim to life. L'chaim to life and death.",

It sounds like it shouldn't work, but I bet it's fucking great. Well, it's so great\"},{\"currTime\":174,\"text\":\"because they both have these insane comprehensive encyclopedic knowledge of movies.

Yeah, but none of the details that I read and\"},{\"currTime\":325,\"text\":\"I admittedly only read maybe two articles skimmed half skimmed while I was doing two other things.\"},{\"currTime\":331,\"text\":\"But the the piece of evidence that they brought up didn't sway me\"},{\"currTime\":335,\"text\":\"toward him. They didn't. It was like that thing of like, I don't think it's proof.

And I think Brendan Dassey knows or participated in it.\"},{\"currTime\":364,\"text\":\"Really? Yeah, because if you go back, which I've done now and read his whole 10 hours\"},{\"currTime\":370,\"text\":\"of transcript, their shit, they're not feeding him that are two. It's too much of a narrative.\"},{\"currTime\":377,\"text\":\"But he said it's from kiss the girls.

I have already changed\"},{\"currTime\":408,\"text\":\"my mind. The family. Well, no, I mean, I think that's good. You have to continually reproach it.\"},{\"currTime\":414,\"text\":\"Like the district circuit court judge that you are. And now we stay neutral.\"},{\"currTime\":418,\"text\":\"Did you know I went to school? Yeah. Um, but I I don't know. I I'm much more interested in like\"},{\"currTime\":426,\"text\":\"you can tell that there's a very real systemic problem. That's not even I'm not talking about that.\"},{\"currTime\":432,\"text\":\"Yeah, that's shit. Those people do whatever they want. You can tell that that that district\"},{\"currTime\":437,\"text\":\"attorney just does whatever he wants. I think the key was planted. I think that probably maybe the\"},{\"currTime\":442,\"text\":\"blood was planted. I don't think that he got a fair trial and everything. It's interesting. One of\"},{\"currTime\":448,\"text\":\"the things that I kind of led me down a rabbit hole is people are saying that the key that they\"},{\"currTime\":451,\"text\":\"found that's a spare key. That's like maybe the brother. They're like, we know it's Stephen Avery\"},{\"currTime\":459,\"text\":\"and he gave him a spare key. The brother gave her spare key to him to like plant. And there's\"},{\"currTime\":464,\"text\":\"like a photo that they keep showing of her standing by her car with her camera and stuff. And you can\"},{\"currTime\":468,\"text\":\"see her big old key chain for holding it in there. It's like so that her purse wasn't found. Nothing\"},{\"currTime\":473,\"text\":\"was found. So and then the ex-boyfriend, there's the picture where he has a scratch on his hand.\"},{\"currTime\":480,\"text\":\"Right. Like like a human fingernail scratch that's really long. Yeah. I don't think they had anything\"},{\"currTime\":485,\"text\":\"to do with it. I think they probably found the car. But I bet they like trespassed onto the\"},{\"currTime\":491,\"text\":\"CV. This is all based on shit that I've read on Reddit too, by the way. I'm not taking any\"},{\"currTime\":494,\"text\":\"fucking credit for that. Found the car because they knew that she was going there, called the cops\"},{\"currTime\":501,\"text\":\"up and it was an illegal fucking fine. And so they made that the woman who's in the search party\"},{\"currTime\":506,\"text\":\"go find the car. Right. Does it make any nobody anyone is listening who hasn't watched it.\"},{\"currTime\":512,\"text\":\"Everyone's watched it.

No. You know anonymous went in and like released all those files.\"},{\"currTime\":529,\"text\":\"I'm interested. I don't know.

He's in the\"},{\"currTime\":540,\"text\":\"background of a fuck in the video. Yeah. And he was there's a serial killer.

I haven't seen\"},{\"currTime\":755,\"text\":\"it in so long. Tell me everything. Okay, so this is the story of Cropsy was an urban legend on Staten\"},{\"currTime\":760,\"text\":\"Island and it was there was a hospital named Willow Brook and it is a hospital for mentally\"},{\"currTime\":769,\"text\":\"challenged children and they built it in say like the early 40s and it is on Staten Island\"},{\"currTime\":778,\"text\":\"in the set in the woods and it was a state institution and it was built for 4000 patients,\"},{\"currTime\":786,\"text\":\"but by 1965 it had 6000 children in it.

They have like cerebral palsy and they would just be like tons of cerebral palsy kids\"},{\"currTime\":811,\"text\":\"were completely intelligent and 100% there just dumped. And so what ended up happening was of\"},{\"currTime\":818,\"text\":\"course, because it's like a state funded hospital. So it's over. It's over overflowing with patients.\"},{\"currTime\":826,\"text\":\"What's the order I'm looking for? Understaffed, overpopulated and so they end up a reporter\"},{\"currTime\":836,\"text\":\"finally goes in when we talked about it on the last episode. I said something really grandiose\"},{\"currTime\":841,\"text\":\"like Robert Kennedy shut it down, but herald a Rivera, herald a Rivera. So but Kennedy saw it in\"},{\"currTime\":847,\"text\":\"the 70 68 and said this is a snake pit. This is a disgrace. And they started doing all these\"},{\"currTime\":854,\"text\":\"reviews. And what had happened was all these children being in this close proximity. They\"},{\"currTime\":859,\"text\":\"found out it was like they were just in rooms naked, being hosed down horrible. There's no\"},{\"currTime\":864,\"text\":\"lighting is crazy. And a bunch of them started getting hepatitis.

Exactly. And they were basically giving them all hepatitis, they were\"},{\"currTime\":877,\"text\":\"getting it. It was so anyway, with all of this, these social workers finally went in there,\"},{\"currTime\":883,\"text\":\"saw the conditions, they got a reporter in there. And that's what led to a woman started writing\"},{\"currTime\":888,\"text\":\"expos\\u00e9s for like a local newspaper. And then that's how heraldo got on the scene. He worked as\"},{\"currTime\":897,\"text\":\"an investigative reporter for W ABC in New York.

It's it gets mentioned a lot\"},{\"currTime\":929,\"text\":\"in all the research. But he basically went in and like the only lighting was the light on the\"},{\"currTime\":937,\"text\":\"camera. It looks like it looks like like a American horror story, like asylum, like totally\"},{\"currTime\":944,\"text\":\"just exactly what you think it's supposed to be like it would be like 30 kids in a room naked\"},{\"currTime\":948,\"text\":\"sitting on the cement floor rocking back and forth.

Yeah. And they yeah. And I'm trapped in here. Nightmare. Okay. So right. So\"},{\"currTime\":963,\"text\":\"that alone is a nightmare. That's Willow Brook nightmare.

But you know,\"},{\"currTime\":975,\"text\":\"about like the rights of civil civil rights thing for patients and stuff, all this stuff.\"},{\"currTime\":984,\"text\":\"Well, so then the urban legend pops up. So they ended up closing it in 1987. But they basically\"},{\"currTime\":990,\"text\":\"closed it in 72 or four. After this expose, they came out, they shipped all of the patients to all\"},{\"currTime\":997,\"text\":\"different hospitals around and there was only like 200 patients left.

And so the high school kids, the big thing was go through the woods, get to the mental\"},{\"currTime\":1025,\"text\":\"hospital and like, touch the wall of it or whatever. Absolutely not. And cross Cropsey's out there with\"},{\"currTime\":1030,\"text\":\"you.

I would have gotten 11 months if it was today, because\"},{\"currTime\":1202,\"text\":\"of us. So he gets out. And then that would be 69 71. In 72, a nine year old girl named Alice\"},{\"currTime\":1212,\"text\":\"Freire, it disappears off Staten Island.

And she's\"},{\"currTime\":1231,\"text\":\"never seen again. And then in 1983, this is this is a real highlight for me. He picks up 11 children\"},{\"currTime\":1239,\"text\":\"from a YMCA in a school bus, takes them to White Castle, and then drives them to the Newark airport\"},{\"currTime\":1246,\"text\":\"for five hours.

I think that's\"},{\"currTime\":1288,\"text\":\"what all of it this is because Staten Island is not that big. And I think it's like run down to\"},{\"currTime\":1292,\"text\":\"the store for mommy.

And the, one of the most\"},{\"currTime\":3062,\"text\":\"upsetting things I read when I was reading that story is he was standing at the, at like a play\"},{\"currTime\":3068,\"text\":\"station or a Atari stand in Sears with his mom and his mom went away to go get something and he,\"},{\"currTime\":3075,\"text\":\"he was, he was 20 feet away, if not less.

    "transcript_text": " We at Wondery live, breathe and downright obsess over true crime and now we're launching the ultimate true crime fan experience, Exhibit C. Join now by following Wondery, Exhibit C on Facebook and listen to true crime on Wondery and Amazon Music, Exhibit C. It's truly criminal. Welcome to my favorite murder. Welcome. That's Karen. I'm Georgia. That's Georgia. Thanks for listening. Two girls, one murder. Obsessed with true crime, both of us. With bad things. Bad things happening. We love it. We want to know all about it, so it'll never happen to us. And it turns out so do a lot of other people. Yeah. Because lots of people have been telling us about how much they like it. We got a lot of emails from the last episodes of people telling us their town murders, which I love and is like so exciting and we haven't read them yet because we want to surprise each other with it. Yes. But so many, I would look at the first line in Gmail and it would say like these little things because I'm fucking curious and I want to know what they say. But so many people like I didn't, I'm so, I was always so embarrassed that this is a thing that I was into, which I'm like, what? Try to talk to everyone about it. I know. Well, that's what, that's how I felt when I was younger. Yeah. Like that I was like crazy. Or people would think that you wanted to murder people. Right, exactly. And then the second I started doing stand up and every other stand of comic knew every serial killer backwards and forwards. I was like, oh, I get it. I wonder what it is. Anxious people. Yeah. Probably. And it's so fascinating. Yeah. It's like the worst of humanity. Yeah, I wonder if it's a little OCDish too, where like, I need to know everything about this now. Yeah. And everything that's related to it. Yeah, please help, help me prepare for when I run face to face into John Wayne Gacy. Because now you and I are gonna be able to fucking beat up any serial killer murderer. I found a new podcast, not new, it's really old, but they talk about murderers and stuff a lot. And maybe I shouldn't plug it because then it's like, go ahead. No, it's really good. It's called, have you thinking sideways podcast? No, I've never heard of that. It's like a girl and two dudes and they just talk about like, weird shit. And a lot of it is murder. It's great. I like it. I started listening to Joe DeRosa and Pat Walsh's podcast. I'll see you in hell, which because I had to drive home from San Francisco yesterday at six hours. So I listened to many and it was really hilarious. I recommend that. What are they talking about? They talk about they put on a horror movie, but then they just talk over it. You can't hear it or anything. They just tell you what movie it is and they talk about it incidentally as they have conversations. It sounds like it shouldn't work, but I bet it's fucking great. Well, it's so great because they both have these insane comprehensive encyclopedic knowledge of movies. So any tangent they go on, they know exactly who and what they're talking about, which of course was a real sore spot for me. As I anytime I bring up a subject, I'm like, you know that thing that happened that time. Hold on, hold on. Well, you need like the right person to fill in the blanks and you're just like, Oh, this is why I'm friends with you is because you use like, I was just rambling and you were and you filled it in and that's the best. That's what we do. Right. It's totally what we do. I was going to make you say the last part didn't work. I guess we're not good at that part. I'm really excited audience because Georgia got new coaches. And when I was listening to our first episode, there's a sound in the background at the entire time. It's me squeaking on my couch, like just constantly moving around. It was a leather couch. It was making me laugh so hard. Oh, God, I didn't do it. So that's it. But no, it's all cleared up. I got these for podcasting. So I don't make background noise and podcasting perfect podcasting couch can write them off. Wait, not that I make any money on podcasting. This is not a money making venture. Everyone don't quit your job. You never know. You don't ever know. You don't ever know. You don't ever know. Like getting murdered. Yep. Should we jump into it? Or should we talk about making a murderer? Have you been reading all the making a murderer theories? Well, the natural backlash has happened. Yeah. I'm pretty sure he's guilty now. Are you? I'm pretty sure he's guilty now. Are you really? Yes. I think that's very adult of you to be able to change positions. Yeah, really. It doesn't feel good. Well, look, here's the thing. And this is the this is the one thing I agree with. In general, I think he's innocent. And I think very bad things are happening in that state. I think people, there's a natural backlash when you get kind of spoon fed and ants, not an answer, but like a villain. And like, here's, here's really what happened. And they're leaving just enough pieces free so you can put the mystery together yourself. And then everyone thinks they got it and they're on it. Well, there's always the hot take of like, no, actually, right? Because everyone wants to know details. Well, that's the problem is the people who are looking up details are like, oh, this documentary was really one sided and you guys left so much shit out, which makes me suspect of you and suspect of your your conclusion. Yeah, but none of the details that I read and I admittedly only read maybe two articles skimmed half skimmed while I was doing two other things. But the the piece of evidence that they brought up didn't sway me toward him. They didn't. It was like that thing of like, I don't think it's proof. The things that they mentioned that was evidence that got left out was not stronger evidence than like bones in the fire pit or do you know what I think? I think that someone on that property, some ones did it. But maybe it wasn't Steve Avery. And I think Brendan Dassey knows or participated in it. Really? Yeah, because if you go back, which I've done now and read his whole 10 hours of transcript, their shit, they're not feeding him that are two. It's too much of a narrative. But he said it's from kiss the girls. Remember that part in the end? In the court room, he's like, it's from kiss the girls. Yeah, I know he might have made that up. There's some shit that it's like this really this is a narrative you're telling and you're too stupid to like make up a this story that sounds this this much of a narrative. Right? It's just that no zero blood anywhere. I know. Which is why I'm like, it probably happened somewhere else and it wasn't maybe it wasn't Steve. I just changed it. It's been three minutes. I have already changed my mind. The family. Well, no, I mean, I think that's good. You have to continually reproach it. Like the district circuit court judge that you are. And now we stay neutral. Did you know I went to school? Yeah. Um, but I I don't know. I I'm much more interested in like you can tell that there's a very real systemic problem. That's not even I'm not talking about that. Yeah, that's shit. Those people do whatever they want. You can tell that that that district attorney just does whatever he wants. I think the key was planted. I think that probably maybe the blood was planted. I don't think that he got a fair trial and everything. It's interesting. One of the things that I kind of led me down a rabbit hole is people are saying that the key that they found that's a spare key. That's like maybe the brother. They're like, we know it's Stephen Avery and he gave him a spare key. The brother gave her spare key to him to like plant. And there's like a photo that they keep showing of her standing by her car with her camera and stuff. And you can see her big old key chain for holding it in there. It's like so that her purse wasn't found. Nothing was found. So and then the ex-boyfriend, there's the picture where he has a scratch on his hand. Right. Like like a human fingernail scratch that's really long. Yeah. I don't think they had anything to do with it. I think they probably found the car. But I bet they like trespassed onto the CV. This is all based on shit that I've read on Reddit too, by the way. I'm not taking any fucking credit for that. Found the car because they knew that she was going there, called the cops up and it was an illegal fucking fine. And so they made that the woman who's in the search party go find the car. Right. Does it make any nobody anyone is listening who hasn't watched it. Everyone's watched it. Everyone's watched it in America and decided it's going to be interesting to see if anything actually really what happened with that. Were you reading these papers off of that anonymous like file dump? No. You know anonymous went in and like released all those files. I'm interested. I don't know. But then there was a thing today that that was it today or yesterday that was there's a serial killer that they think is good for her murder. He's in the background of a fuck in the video. Yeah. And he was there's a serial killer. He was known for going to the trials of the people he would frame. Yeah. But he's a big old fat unhealthy dude. And sorry. What's the problem? Well, how could he like a young straight woman? Although I guess if you're like help me I need help and you just push her in the van. It's a classic buffalo bill scenario. Yeah. Totally. Totally. For a second. What do you say for a big old fat girl, big old fat girl. She a big old fat person. Get me out of here you bitch. Me and my sister just watched this science of lambs. And I was saying Clarice Starling's lines two seconds before she would say them. And this is how I know my sister loves me. She never told me to shut up because we've been watching TV together for so long. She's just used to my insanity, but I couldn't not do it. That's nice. I do that. And then I apologize the whole time. But I still keep doing it. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But I like just keep fucking doing it. Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter. How do you not do that when you know that that's what she's going to say and you can do it just like her. That's the best movie. It's really. Did your niece watch it with you? No, no. Oh god, I was like, she's gonna have a nightmare for the rest of her life. She's only nine. No. I think I had seen it by that. I think I'm ruined. I think you saw it when you were nine. I think I saw when I was really young. I don't know, whatever. I read the book in college and actually, I was home alone all day and began to think I was Clarice Starling as I was reading the book. I was so into it. I went insane. You probably were. I kind of was. Did I already tell you that story? No. Well, it's true. What makes a person a murderer? Are they born to kill or are they made to kill? I'm Candace DeLong and on my new podcast, Killer Psyche Daily, I share a quick 10-minute rundown every weekday on the motivations and behaviors of the criminal masterminds, psychopaths, and cold-blooded killers you hear about in the news. I have decades of experience as a psychiatric nurse, FBI agent, and criminal profiler. On Killer Psyche Daily, I'll give you insight into cases like Ryan Grantham and the newly arrested Stockton Serial Killer. I'll also bring on expert guests to dive deeper into the details, share what it's like to work with a behavioral assessment unit at Quantico, answer some killer trivia, and even host virtual Q&As where I'll answer your burning questions. Hey, Prime members, listen to the Amazon Music exclusive podcast, Killer Psyche Daily, in the Amazon Music app. Download the app today. Hey, Karen. Hey. What's your favorite murder? Well, I thought it would be good that I would do a little damage control since on our last episode. I was so sloppy and inaccurate talking about Cropsy. That was one of the ones we're literally guessing what the name of the thing was I was trying to talk about. Let everyone know that this is not an official report of anything that's happened. We're not doctors. You're looking in the wrong place. We're not therapists. But the story has all of the elements of murder, you know, creeper, urban legend story, everything I love. It's got a mental hospital. It's got the woods. It's almost like that's too much if someone had written this thing. Yeah, it's like you can pick one or the other, but you can't have a mental hospital in the woods. It's crazy. I haven't seen it in so long. Tell me everything. Okay, so this is the story of Cropsy was an urban legend on Staten Island and it was there was a hospital named Willow Brook and it is a hospital for mentally challenged children and they built it in say like the early 40s and it is on Staten Island in the set in the woods and it was a state institution and it was built for 4000 patients, but by 1965 it had 6000 children in it. It was built for how many? 4000. So it was way over capacity and and this was back when people used to dump their children. So and it didn't matter if they had Down syndrome or if they were very, very, you know, there was something really wrong with them. They have like cerebral palsy and they would just be like tons of cerebral palsy kids were completely intelligent and 100% there just dumped. And so what ended up happening was of course, because it's like a state funded hospital. So it's over. It's over overflowing with patients. What's the order I'm looking for? Understaffed, overpopulated and so they end up a reporter finally goes in when we talked about it on the last episode. I said something really grandiose like Robert Kennedy shut it down, but herald a Rivera, herald a Rivera. So but Kennedy saw it in the 70 68 and said this is a snake pit. This is a disgrace. And they started doing all these reviews. And what had happened was all these children being in this close proximity. They found out it was like they were just in rooms naked, being hosed down horrible. There's no lighting is crazy. And a bunch of them started getting hepatitis. So then they had medical studies where they were testing hepatitis on these children might as well do some fucking scientific testing. Exactly. And they were basically giving them all hepatitis, they were getting it. It was so anyway, with all of this, these social workers finally went in there, saw the conditions, they got a reporter in there. And that's what led to a woman started writing exposés for like a local newspaper. And then that's how heraldo got on the scene. He worked as an investigative reporter for W ABC in New York. So he went there and they did, they did an exposé story that ended up winning a Peabody because it was so and they just kind of like they went when there were doctors were gone and stuff, right? Or the doctors let them in that. So I don't know about the heraldo part. I don't know how he got in. But but the we talked about this before, when you see the videotape and there is a documentary called Willow Brook, like it's something like the great shame or something like something like that. It's it gets mentioned a lot in all the research. But he basically went in and like the only lighting was the light on the camera. It looks like it looks like like a American horror story, like asylum, like totally just exactly what you think it's supposed to be like it would be like 30 kids in a room naked sitting on the cement floor rocking back and forth. And then they talked to one guy and he was like one of the patients and he's like, I have cerebral palsy and I am completely mentally functioning on 100%. Yeah. And they yeah. And I'm trapped in here. Nightmare. Okay. So right. So that alone is a nightmare. That's Willow Brook nightmare. Heraldo being in it isn't great. But it ends up they had it with all that in the expose, they passed legislation. But you know, about like the rights of civil civil rights thing for patients and stuff, all this stuff. Well, so then the urban legend pops up. So they ended up closing it in 1987. But they basically closed it in 72 or four. After this expose, they came out, they shipped all of the patients to all different hospitals around and there was only like 200 patients left. So it was basically empty. And that's when the urban legends started, where it was, there's a mental patient that's still on the grounds, because there's a tunnel system underneath the hospital. And he's living in the tunnels at night, he comes out and steals children. That was the big thing on statin island in the 80s. Oh my God, how fucking terrifying to live in statin island. Crazy, right? And so the high school kids, the big thing was go through the woods, get to the mental hospital and like, touch the wall of it or whatever. Absolutely not. And cross Cropsey's out there with you. So and there's a great documentary called Cropsey, where they go into all this, they have all the information that you need if you're fascinated, because it's really good and fascinating. So I just imagine like parents in the 80s, being like, you'd be good or we're a cropped, he's going to come get you in statin island. You're like, well, actually, that could happen. Actually, it's happening. My mom would say, you'd be good. I'm going to call the Indian reservation and have them come get you, which is like, so racist. My grandmother used to say, don't put like, if you were holding money, she'd say, don't put it, don't put it in your mouth. It could have been in the Chinaman's ear. Like you're going to put money in your fucking mouth. Oh my God, racist. Racist in the just in like a chipper grandma way. Right. So anyway, so now, now we're going to introduce a new character in this, in this story. And it's a man named Andre Rand. And he was, he's described in one of the pages that I read as a mentally incompetent, convicted child sex offender. So he's got it all. Yeah. And he was a janitor at Willow Brook from 1966 six to 1960. I feel like anyone you're going to hire to be a janitor there, you have to be like, no, you're fired because why like, you're crazy clearly. Yes. Well, and you've got to think if these children were being housed like animals, like no, no better than animals, probably worse in some ways, the staff that were there letting this happen and looking at it every day, not the greatest people you're going to want. Let's say they're not around. We can, we can, we can pretty I'm sure there's a couple of gems and they're like, I'm staying because they need me and I'm the only hope they have. But the majority probably, I mean, in life, there's probably one out of 100 people who even like that. Yeah. So you get, you're going to get people who are real good with throwing a bucket of water on a bunch of mentally ill children and walking out of the room. You've got, you get with that, Andre. Okay, great. You've got the job. So in the, so this guy gets the job in 66. Well, in 69, he, so he works there from 66 to 68. In 69, he attempts to rape a nine year old girl. And just by chance, a cop car is, is driving by, he takes a nine year old girl into his car and took to an empty lot and takes off his clothes, her clothes are off a cop car drives by. Sometimes life works well, you know, I mean, yeah, go on. This is an upside. This is one upside and it's hideous story. He gets sentenced to four years. He only serves 10 months, you know, the the classic scenario. I hate everything. This is why we have to do this podcast is because our fucking penal system blows. We get because we got to talk about it. We get we're going to affect change. Oh, clearly, laying on these couch. I would have gotten 11 months if it was today, because of us. So he gets out. And then that would be 69 71. In 72, a nine year old girl named Alice Freire, it disappears off Staten Island. Then in 1981, nine years later, a seven year old girl named Holly Ann Hughes goes missing. And the eyewitnesses saw her with Rand. No way. And she's never seen again. And then in 1983, this is this is a real highlight for me. He picks up 11 children from a YMCA in a school bus, takes them to White Castle, and then drives them to the Newark airport for five hours. And when he gets back, he gets arrested for kidnapping who the fuck is letting a guy who's been in prison for attempted rape, drive a fucking bus of school bus, the 80s. He rapes a nine year old tries to rape a nine year old and then goes ahead and get some job driving is the 80s needs to go to prison for fucking. So this was back before we realized children were constantly in danger. So in 83, an 11 year old named to he's Jackson disappears, walking to the store. And this is 12 days after Rand is released for I thought he was buying cigarettes for his mom, like I bet that's what you know, yeah, that's the 80s. I think that's what all of it this is because Staten Island is not that big. And I think it's like run down to the store for mommy. And it's probably one of the girls lived in a motel. It's bad news anyway. Okay. So that was 11 days after he got out of prison for the kidnapping 12 days, 12 days, he does that. And that's the same year he did the oh, so he did the YMCA school bus trick, and then gets out of prison 12 days later, this kid goes missing a girl, it's a girl. And then in 84, a 22 year old guy who was a really low IQ goes missing. And then in 87, a girl named Jennifer Schweiger goes missing and she has Down syndrome. And several eyewitnesses saw this guy, Andre Rand, leading her by the hand toward the woods. I mean, there's your poster for the horror movie. So they start searching for her. And after 35 days, they find her nude body in a shallow grave on the Willowbrook property. And then a couple feet, you know, several feet away. Andre Rand has a makeshift campsite. He's been living on the Willowbrook grounds. And the whole urban legend is true. And they eventually, they charge him with kidnapping and first degree murder, but they can't make the murder stick. They get him for first degree kidnapping, and then they bring back. And then once he's in jail for that, he gets like 20 years. Then in 2004, they put him on trial for the Holly Hughes disappearance. And he's convicted of kidnapping. And he gets now he's set to get out in 2035 or something like that when he's 95. So he's in, he's in for good. They also linked him to the disappearance of Apple Atwell and the rape murder of Shin Lee, who are both Willowbrook aides. So he's a beast. And he's, and it's basically the most fascinating story of that it all was true. What a bummer to go to work and then you get killed. Like, don't go in the woods. Don't walk to the store by yourself. But you're like, I'm just going to work. Just going to work, just trying to pay my rent. So that's, that's cropsie. That's a good murder. I mean, it's, what's good about is that it's the worst thing I've ever heard in my life. You know, that's, that's the stats on this show is like, what's the worst thing you've ever heard in your life? I mean, don't you want to, why hasn't anyone gone into the tunnels in that hospital and like dug around archeologically and tried to find Karen, a hundredth episode. Let's fucking do it. We get a school bus full of 11 children and drive them to Staten Island. Just pay Palace the money to get plane tickets to Staten Island and to not stay on Staten Island because fuck that. We're staying in Manhattan. We got to stay in Manhattan. We got to see Hamilton. Yeah. We got to go to the, go to the shoe stores. Yeah. Then cropsie. Then cropsie. Yeah. Oh, brother. Yeah. That was mine. What's yours, Georgia? Well, well, what's interesting about both of ours is that the murderer in question, still alive in prison, still alive. How are these, isn't it weird that this person, it's like in your mind, they're like, Oh, they did these awful things that long ago. They're dead. Nope. No. They had dinner tonight. They watched some TV. They watched some TV. Yeah. They had a conversation with the guard. Perhaps they played some bones. Probably play bones out with people doing prison. I don't know what bones is. It's dominoes. Yeah. What do you think he had for dinner? Something gross. Chicken nugget? Yeah. Yeah. Dinner. That's better than what I've had for dinner. And he's a monster. And he's a monster. He's a monster. Speaking of monsters. Okay. My favorite murder is that of Michelle Wallace. Michelle with 1L. And I remember seeing, I love cold cases. Like that's, I love when murders get solved, of course. Yeah. But cold cases are my like, passion and my dream. I'm passionate about getting away with it. Because it's just so curious. I'm just so curious. Yeah. But I also like that the answers never like satisfying. It's always like, that's just some fucking janitor asshole did this to all these people. That's such a bummer. I want to be like a monster or something. Okay. So, and I remember watching a cold case of this a long time ago. And two things that stuck out to me. Okay. She's a 25 year old photographer. This is 1974. She lives in Chicago. She's like this free spirit photographer. And she travels the world and taking photos and taking odd jobs and stuff. And she goes to, in 1974, goes to Oregon, spends a couple days in the Rocky Mountains, just taking some photos. I think I've seen this, this one. Yeah. Is it a forensic files? I think there's a forensic files on it. She's leaving the Rocky Mountains and she does the classic 1970s. I want to get murdered move. Do you know what that is? Is it hitchhiking? It's fucking hitchhikers. She picks up hitchhikers. Oh, she picks them up. She picks up two dudes. Oh, no. What? One girl alone picks up two dudes. What? The 70s and 80s. They're going to prison. Yeah. What did they look like? I wondered that she was like, this is fine. Yeah. I don't know. Was one really short or something? Short guys are strong. Don't pick up anyone. And they're mad. And they're angry. Yeah. So we're going to get a lot of hate mail for this. No, no, it's fine. I'm short. It's fine. So she drops one of them off at the bar, this one dude. And then of course, she is never seen again. Then the guy who she dropped off, a couple like finds out this girl's missing and he's like, wait a second, she dropped me off. And then the guy I was with who I barely knew said, I'm going to, can you take me to my car actually? And the, and the guy was like, I didn't think he had a car. So I thought that was strange. So they start looking, his name is Roy. Sorry, the guy that got dropped off the bar is the one that says that. Yeah, he's like, okay, I didn't think Roy is his name had a car. Okay. And he's like, you know, why did you let her leave with him? Fuck, you know, like right there, you could have fucking fixed it. Anyway, Roy Mielson, me, Melonson, Melonson, should have looked that up before. Roy Mielson, he's a drifter and a convicted rapist. So but he got out after very short time. Sure. Why would you keep him in? Yeah, it's time now he knows to kill the person so they can't ID him. You know, it's like, that's how you do that. That's how you progress. Having a panic attack. He's found with her driver's license, camping equipment, car keys and pond tickets for her camera. And this is one of my favorite parts of why it stuck with me. And I can't fucking find this online now. Some reasons not up there anymore. The they find the camera at the pawn shop, the lat they developed the film, it's all her photos in the Rocky Mountains. The very last photo is Roy sitting on a bed behind him laying down as a naked woman. And it's it's not her. So he has her count, you know, it's like, that's the proof. Yeah. She she's missing and you robbed her and you took a photo of yourself, you fucking idiot. And I can't find that photo. I know it was in the forensic files or whatever. I totally remember this because yeah, because it's so freaky. So freaky. But in this guy never got caught. No, okay, here's my other favorite part about this. Okay, well, it's an awful story. Okay, five weeks later, Michelle's mom just kills herself because she can't even do it. Like my daughter didn't come back. She I know she's dead, kills herself. And then in 79. So what is that five, six years later, five years later? This is the other part that's really fucked up and stuck with me. They find just a scalp with two brown haired braids on it, like a scalp only. Oh, where did they some hiker found it in near where near where she had picked up the hitchhikers. So just a fucking scalp. I'm gonna keep saying because it's fucking off. Just picture you think it was like sitting on a log or yeah, definitely hanging from a branch. Probably they showed it. There's a photo which there's there's hanging from a branch. Sorry. Well, you got to think like, he didn't. He definitely didn't scalp her probably. This is animal work. Oh, you think so? Well, I guess if it's that clean, maybe not. But I would think so. No, I don't. I mean, I have no idea. But my first guess is, doesn't it all decompose at the same time? Like why would the scalp still be there if nothing else is there? Well, and maybe an animal pulled it off like was chewing at the everyone is who's listening right now and freaking out at us and hates us so much. And this we've just lost half our listeners. Here's the thing though. It's like, that's kind of part of what's interesting about serial killers is when they do things. It's those markers. Utilization. Yeah. They're not a lot of them. I don't think that's a normal like a, I don't know. What do you think? Well, sometimes it's like a calling card, right? Of like, Oh, that's the thing is he wants to keep their hair or remove their hair. I don't know whatever. It makes me think of that of like a scalping serial killer. There's wage. I've read way too much about cutting off nipples. I just can't read about cutting off nipples anymore. I know your face is telling is it as I'm just picturing it. The thought of like hurt really bad. It hurts to think about it. So the thought of someone doing it, you have to be just a complete sociopath. Yeah. Clearly your psychopathic. Anyways, okay. Clearly have a problem with your mother. Sorry. That's fair. It's true. That's fair. Okay. They find the scalp, but that's, but, you know, it's 1979. And so they don't have a body. So they can't prosecute. So they put in a brown cardboard box, put it up on the shelf, right in a hot room. Yeah. But like, there's like, there's no body. So they can't prosecute, but it's like, well, I feel like nowadays you can prosecute without a body much more easily. Yeah. And then so 12 years goes by. Nobody. This woman, Kathy Young, who becomes like the sheriff in town or I'm sure I'm saying that incorrect. She's not. I'm sure she's much higher up. She hires this, this company called Necro Search, which I remember thinking at the time, that's what I want to do. I want to work there for a living. Like I just want to, I want to like the name alone. Yeah. I just want to follow, I want to follow them like the Grateful Dead. I want to be the receptionist as Necro Search. I can be like, Necro Search can help you. What's your, what's your emergency? Skilling crossbones. But they like, they like, they have uncovered, what they, what they do is they find and they're really good at uncovering clandestine grave sites. It's like, you badass motherfuckers. How do they have like a, they have like a farm. They have a farm where they like bury pigs, dead pigs and kind of understand the soil changes and like what, you know, what doesn't, what doesn't look right out in the, in nature? What is man made? What is placed there? These sorts of things. And like, what is the decomposition of this pile of soil or dirt or like, you know, these, these kinds of things, what has been dug up in the past 10 years even, that's different from the soil next to it. Do animals, scalp people and keep the braids for themselves? Exactly. Stuff like that. Well, here's what happened is they took her braids and did some forensic analysis on them and found the leaves of a tree in the, that was in a certain area of that, those mountains. So they went there, they spread out out on that area where the trees are day two, fucking find her bones, what was left of them. Wow. I know. These guys, they've uncovered over 200 and they've taken on over 235 cases. I don't know how many they found, but man, these guys, these are the good guys. Necro search. I love that. I know. I bet we're at a party, we would corner these people and I bet they get kicked out of parties a lot though. Oh my God. Yeah. I would never leave a Necro searcher alone. No, can we get, can we have a request if anyone knows a Necro searcher to, I think they're in San Francisco to please have them be on the podcast. I just think that's insanely fascinating. It's almost like having X-ray vision, like you can look at a forest or a like, you know, a ditch and know what's wrong and what, you know, what's off. Absolutely. Well, the woman who found the bones was like, they were all, they were all searching for two days. She goes off the trail to take a piss in the woods, which I think it shouldn't be allowed if you're looking for us. Hey, she's still human. Yeah. And she looks and there's a ray of light flashing on a gold tooth. She finds the skull. Oh, that's the, that's the Lord's work. Yeah. And it was, sorry, this is where my Christian part comes in. This is it. I know, not, not before she dies and she, when he, no, no, no, it doesn't belong there. Well, it's at the bottom of a ravine. So like someone straight toss person over, like didn't even, didn't even bury her. Just threw in, tossed her over. So they take Roy Mielenson to trial. He is found guilty in 93. So she gets killed in 74, found guilty in 93. Um, since then, and I didn't know this until I started looking up to it, he's been convicted for another murder, which happened 50 days before Michelle's murder in Napa in 1974. Yeah. A woman who was stabbed to death at her bar, she owned, and they found a cigarette butt that had his DNA on it, put it through the fucking CODIS, the most amazing thing in the world, found his DNA match. Another woman in Louisiana who fucking, it's gruesome, which, so he's done it multiple times. Yeah. At least twice that they know of through DNA. Wow. But they're not, they're not taking the third one to trial because it's too expensive to do all these things for, which sucks for that family. Yes. You know, but they know it's him. Yeah. Now they know it's him, but he's going to go to jail anyway. So their, their rationale is he's there. Right. Which is why Napa took them, took him to trial is because he's, he can be eligible for parole, which I think is fucking hilarious for Michelle's murder in like, not in like the next 10 years, eligible for parole. So they convicted him to make sure that if that ever happens, oh, that's good. He has to be extradited to California. Yeah. It's very strange the way the laws still work like that, where it's just kind of like, oh, when then we let him out again. Right. And then, but you know what, he was real good inside. So we let him out again. Yeah. We're like, well, at the trial, like one of this jurors sneezed wrong. So he, he's out. Yeah. And we don't have enough money to try him again. And we think we're going to lose. And we'll probably won't warn anybody just to keep it interesting. The good thing about all of this is that hitchhiking pretty much doesn't exist anymore. Thank God. We've talked about this before. Like, I don't even understand like, I know it's like an innocent time and shit, but like, I don't think that's common sense any time in your life. No, any point in history. No, I mean, think of like, if you were at a party with your friends, friends, you probably wouldn't want to be in a car with any of those people. Yeah. And those are like cold. So imagine if it's just anybody driving down the street. Have you ever hitchhiked? Is that negative of me? No, no. You don't want to be at a party with your friends? No, I've never hitchhiked. I've never done anything like that. I think I have when I was a kid, but like with a friend and I think the person like, it was like an Irvine where it's just like the safest place and all, but it was idiotic. And I think the person who picked us up like yelled at us. I did pick up two girls who were in junior high. We were driving home. We were driving up to Petaluma from LA, me and my ex, and we stopped at a gas station and there were two little girls that were, couldn't have been more than 14 years old sitting at the gas station. It was two in the morning and they were, they were trying to make phone calls. The whole time we were getting gas, I was watching them and they were trying to make phone calls and they were doing this stuff. Two in the morning. And I was watching them and the guy that worked there wasn't, seemed a little creepy. And he was kind of like coming out and looking at them and going back in and people would pull in and I was just the whole time staring at them. And finally, when we went to leave, I was like drive over there and we pulled up and I was like, do you guys need a ride home? And they were like, yep. And immediately got in the car. And I was like, first of all, never get into a car with people. And then secondly, did you go to Lusat and grammar school? And they both went to my sister's grammar school and I got names and they kind of smelled, it was like, clearly they were from the bad side of town and they got like, they probably snuck out and then got stuck somewhere and then ended up at this gas station out by the freeway where I was like, not walkable. No, it was, it was, it's like five miles away from any neighborhood. And it's all farmland and shit. Yeah. So we dropped them off and I, I was like, don't ever do this again. And they were like, and then ran in and they will. But where are they now? I wonder if they remember you? No, they both own that gas station. Because of my setting them on their way. Yeah. Correctly. Good job. Thank you. Well, I just want to take a second to brag about something good I did for the community. Do you mind? No, I love it. Thank you. What if they went home and killed their mom? Can I turn this into Obama real quick? They were the ones that were all along. Yep. That's a good twist to rule. It is. That's right a book. They went home and killed their mom. Oh, I'm dead inside. I want to read one of our, so at the end of the show, we like to do your favorite or your town, no, your town murder. Yeah. So either we'll have a guest tell us a story, or we're asking you guys to send us your stories. Should we start at my favorite murder Gmail? I probably should. Sure. Let's do it. My favorite murder Gmail. And then there's also there's also a Facebook group. So you can start Facebook page. We call it Facebook page group page. I don't know what last time you just called it plain old Facebook page and it made me laugh really hard. We have Facebook page Facebook page called my favorite murder and you can tell your story on the front page on the front like tell everyone your shit and like you guys should like bond over and stuff. I feel like I should also start a Twitter account. Maybe this is business that you guys want to hear about, but I should because it seems like that's also a good way for people. You're really good at that and it stresses me out to start from zero like from zero followers. I'm really good at starting Twitter. You're good at Twitter. Oh, thanks. It's my passion. Really that I started like a year ago because I hated it and I hate it now because I it's a it's a difficult exercise. Yeah. It's just it's can you handle putting things out there and wanting something in return and not getting it? No. Well, or can you because you do it and then you get stuff. It's true. I do get stuff out of it. Okay. Yeah. Start one. Let's do that. Okay. Okay. By this by this point that people are listening, it's going to be up anyways. Okay. We made a whole file. Should we let's see. All right. I'm just going to I'm going to close my eyes and scroll and pick one. Great. One of it sucks. Then we'll delete it and start over. Okay. Okay. All right. This is from Todd Deck. Todd. You ready for this? Thanks, Todd. It starts the girl in the box. Hell yeah. Hello. Thank you both for sharing your love of true crime. Truth be told, I've always enjoyed the genre and never really got the opportunity to chat about it with people blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's now time for my true crime story. I am a new public librarian in a rural town. Already sounds awesome. Dude. Thank you for your service. When I first started on the job, my first reference question was, where is the girl in the box? And my initial thought was what the fuck? After some amateur sleuthing, I quickly learned that this patron was asking for a book called Perfect Victim. It's a true crime story detailing the story of a young female hit. We fucking talked about this before on the podcast. This guy did not. Oh no, has it gone up yet? That one? Yeah. Well, we didn't. It wasn't one of our favorite murders. It was a sidebar story. Okay, so I'm not going to get mad at him. Okay. Well, maybe you don't know what he knows about it. Is he just talking about the story itself or does he have some personal connection? I think it happened in a small town he lives in. Oh, yeah. Let's do another one. Okay. But Todd, thanks because we love that story too. Thanks, Todd. No, I really appreciate it. We, you know, it's a that story. That's one of the earlier ones that I ever heard about and I just couldn't picture. I remember being like 12 or 13 and hearing that story and I couldn't picture what it meant. Like, yeah, how do you keep a person in a box under your bed? Yeah. How did, how? Well, I had one of those Ikea bed that had drawers underneath it, so I totally get it. You got it. But they also put a box on her head. That was when they trapped her. That's when they first had her in the car. They were all about boxes in that family. The boxes. Weirdos. Very weird. Not that they also tortured a woman, but. Yeah. And with the boxes, man. All right. There was one that had something about John Walsh. And so I really want to read that one to you because of my theories that I've been reading. Oh, my favorite murder, Adam Walsh case. Here we go. Oh, yeah. This is from E. Allen. It's very fucking long. Ethan Allen, the furniture maker. It's from Ethan Allen. Hello, Georgia. Big fan. What a great podcast. Thanks. My info relates to Adam Walsh who was abducted in 81 from a mall in Hollywood, Florida. In 1978, my dad had this great idea to move our family to Florida to get away from the brutal cold of Western Pennsylvania. His growing paranoia and black ice phobias that killed my social life. Oh, I thought he was going to say killed my, we're not allowed to leave the house. Can I skip over shit? Is that Duke? I think so. Okay. By 1980, I'd found my first job at the Hollywood Mall in Woolworths working at the snack bar, free pretzels and ice cream. But sadly, the icy machine was always on the fritz. The mall was close enough to our house that I could ride my bike to it in about 15 minutes. And remember that it was an indoor mall with a lot of tropical plants, pastel colors, herds of seniors and totally 80s vibe. The location of Adam Walsh's abduction was the Sears department store at the Hollywood Mall. Now I wasn't working July 27, 1981, the day when six year old Adam was abducted. But the news coverage was nonstop beginning that evening. From what I remember, Adam's dad, John Walsh was the police top suspect to begin with. There was lots of silent and not silent judgments from neighbors and community people being about him and his wife, Reeve. By the way, they're still married with new replacement kids, he says. Oh no. That's the joke we made though, right? Yeah. We made that about Jean-Vené right now. I think we opened the door on that. Yeah. Have some replacement kids. Oh my yeah. Oh right. That's pretty harsh though when you read it back. Yeah. Okay. So here's the freaky part, he says. My mom worked locally and came home for lunch that day on her way back to work that afternoon, which she had to drive right by the mall. She remembers being tailgated towards the freeway. The person eventually pulled around her to get by. It was to the point of her getting a good look at the vehicle and thinking the person was really in a big hurry. When the news of Adam's disappearance was on every local TV station, the police begged anyone with info to call. A tip reported by a witness that they saw Adam being pushed into a blue van by a blonde man when he was abducted. When we heard the info about the blue van on the news, my mom started screaming that the blue van had been tailgating her that day. I can remember how crazy and gross and creepy it felt. She ended up calling the police and giving them the information. It's like a month later, they find Adam's head in a canal, chopped off with a machete and another part of Florida somewhere. A deviant felon, Otis Tool, who have you fucking read about this motherfucker? He's the guy that was him and Gary. Yeah. No, I was going to say Gary Ridgeway, but that's no. Yeah, him and him and the class, the guy that just murdered everybody and fucked everybody. Yeah, we, someone's yelling it at home. We need a third person to be the person to tell us. His name is, hold on. I just saw it today. He had a glass eye. I just listened to the last podcast on the left about it. The last podcast on the left did an episode. A really good one. Let me just find it. Oh my God. So irritating. I know, I know. It's, but I also have a sidebar theory on this. If this person doesn't talk about it. Okay. I want to hear this. Hold on. Because Otis is the one that says he did it. You think the other guy did it? Or Otis. Because he has two T's, right? Henry Lee Lucas. Yes. Right? Yes. Yep. Okay. Henry Lee Lucas. Another, okay. Otis Tool arrested for something else confessed. Right. Tool says he drove around with Adam's head in his car for a few days before disposing of it. Tool confesses to killing Adam, but he told the police he snatched him in his car, which was an old Cadillac. Let's see here. He totally checks every box in the know your serial killer study. He then recanted his confession, but in 96 while dying in prison again, admitted to killing Adam. However, there's no actual evidence to link Tool to Adam. So what about the blue van? Is this what you're going to say? Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead. In 2007, there was another investigation and witnesses linking Jeffrey Dahmer to Adam Walsh's disappearance. Is this what you're going to say? He was in Florida at the time and drove a blue van for work. Yeah. If you read that info on, he read info on Dahmer. He didn't cut off victims' heads. He did cut off victims' heads. He did. Often boys, but none as young as Adam, but Dahmer denied killing Adam. Is Dahmer still alive? No. They killed him in jail. Good. The police and John Walsh believe that Tool was the killer of Adam. Police closed the case. Yeah. Here's another thing. If he, is that done? Yeah. Because wait, no, he says, Karen, you were hilarious on Twitter and I loved your Marc Maron interview. Oh, thanks. This was Ethan Allen? Yeah. Yeah. And then he says, wait, Georgia, I don't really know your work. I mean, you're cool. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, E. So I was reading all those, like the Jeffrey Dahmer thing came out of the blue. I was like, what? Which is kind of amazing. But it didn't seem like that was his, his, he's not a kid. Yeah. But cutting off a head and driving a blue van are so much closer than just to some guy being like, yeah, I totally did. Yeah. Absolutely. And blonde and like young and blonde. And they had a really clear description. But here's the thing. Adam Walsh, both of his front teeth were missing the day that he was there at the mall, because their, his picture, I think it says baseball picture that they used of like, have you seen this boy had only been taken like a week or two before. And he has no front teeth. And the, the head that they found in the canal had one front tooth. So there's my whole body is shivering. A whole theory that the boy in the canal was not Adam Walsh. Sorry, I need a minute. I'm like literally going to start crying right now. Oh no, is it? That is the most, life is so crazy. It's so crazy. And like the answers were being given aren't necessarily the truth. No, they're just used to placate us or the bad part of me telling you that is that in learning it. And I was just, this was me because I was home at my family. So I spent tons of time just staring at my phone like in my room. And I clicked on one too many links because I'm very good at avoiding upsetting things. I never like, you know, never listen to 911 calls. I try not to look at too many pictures, but I clicked on this thing and they had the picture of the retrieved. No, they did not. Dick habitated head that they found in the canal. Why is that like public? It's like, you can tell it's a crime scene photo black and white, but I wish I hadn't seen it. But yeah, did you see the tooth? Yeah. And did it look like Adam? I don't, I mean, you can only see part of the fit. Here's the thing. I truly only looked at it for like four seconds because you know the, you know how in a movie when there's a dick capitated head and they look like they're kind of melting. Dick capitated, by the way. Dick capitated twice. I thought it was just an accident, but then you just did it again. I don't think I normally say that. What if that's what you do? It's, I always try to get a little sexual with stuff like this. I think it's appropriate just to get, just to remind everybody to stay sexy. Just like not to get too fucked up. It's like, okay, don't remember dicks. Yeah. Oh, do that at all. It's such an upsetting looking picture that I only looked at for a second, but there's one big like child's grown in front tooth absolutely in the front. So there's no way in 12 days that boy grew that tooth in. And the, one of the most upsetting things I read when I was reading that story is he was standing at the, at like a play station or a Atari stand in Sears with his mom and his mom went away to go get something and he, he was, he was 20 feet away, if not less. And she just went to go over here to like return something. And then there was a fight. The kids started fighting about the video game and a security guard came and kicked them all out, pushed them out of the Sears, made them all leave. So a six year old is standing out on the sidewalk alone, kicked out of the Sears and like too shy to go back inside or be like, no, my mom's there have to be in there. He just goes where they tell him to go. And he basically is standing out on the street alone. I'm gonna throw up. Sorry. No, it's incredible. Like that, that to me is like, this is what it felt like to be in the 80s. Like you just always felt like you were about to be fucking snatched off the goddamn street. Yeah. This story specifically. Yeah, people didn't know to tell their kids like if a, like a security guard is not a cop and you can tell an adult, no, my mom's over there. You can do things, but he was so little. How old was he? Six. Oh, he's a baby. He's a baby. Oh, people are awful. Super gross. Why is life so. But that was like, that was a good one. His mom potentially could could be supporting the Dahmer theory of the Adam Walsh case. I wonder. I mean, I wonder why John is sticking to tool. Oh, tool, tool. Oh, tool. Autist tool. Yeah. I wonder why he like, he doesn't want to change it. He'd probably. They want to be over. He's got to be intense, right? John Maul. Yeah. Oh, you mean like at dinner? Yeah. Yeah. Like nobody wants to talk to him at a party. No, I don't think so. How's your, how are you? I honestly feel like the couple of times I've like let my mind slightly wander into the possibility of that. And like, I would just be on pills the day from the day it happened until the day I died. Why would you ever? Well, like this, like, fucking Michelle's mom, just by. Yes, check out. Yep. Can't. I can't. So much. Fuck. Please don't kill us, everyone. How do we end this on a positive note? Please don't kill us. Everyone is as positive as one could get. This gets, by the way, this is a comedy podcast, right? Like technically. That's what they say. I mean, it's more like a slumber party where things happen that are great and then things happen against your will. And that's just junior high. Too bad. In life, man. That's too bad. So is that counting as our hometown? Yeah, unless you have one that you want to. Well, I have my friend Audrey's from when I went home. Oh my God, yes. It's just that I recorded it at my niece's ninth birthday party. So that's sick. Yeah, we were in the other room. We were far away from any child. I just love that. It was mostly adults. Yeah, let's go in the room. And this is my friend, Audrey, who I've been friends with since sixth grade. And it's about my hometown too. Yeah, equally exciting. Okay, let me make this work. All right. So my favorite story, it's not really a murder, but it's something that happened here in Petaluma. It was like 2003. And it was the guy was known as the Petaluma Crowler, aka to the locals in Petaluma, so this guy put his sweatshirt whole thing, you know, creeper in the summertime would go around to a certain section of town and look for open doors and windows and he would sneak in at night and he would rope women or couples or whatever and tickle their feet and they would scream and then he would run away. So it kept happening weekend night after weekend night, like Friday, Saturday, maybe he'd take a Saturday off to a Sunday. So everyone was getting so freaked out. They had community center meetings about it. When are we going to catch this guy? So one night, my friend and I coming home from the bars, we're driving down her street and we see that there's this whole police line kind of cordoning off the area. So we know that something big is going on. And so we go and we talk to the cop what's going on and they said, Oh, I can't really tell you, but you know, make sure you lock your door when you go inside. So we thought for sure we're going to see him bust out of the bushes in any second. They never caught him, but they think they knew who it was and they sent him off, like shipped him out of town Sacramento. So it was the greatest thing that ever happened. It was very exciting and terrifying at the same time because, you know, tonight put him in the night that he decided to murder somebody. You don't know. He had to keep doing that's a great story. I love that they just ran him out of town, like wild West style instead of Sacramento's problem now. Yep. Go up there. Gosh, that's I wonder. Yeah. That's a good story. Like you wake up because someone's tickling your feet. You know what? Here's the thing though, don't hitchhike as we've said, but don't leave your windows and doors open at night. I don't care how hot it is. Yeah. Sweat your balls off. Or move upstairs. Literally, I would never live on the ground floor because of because I have a terrified anxiety filled human being. I mean, it makes sense. But also there's it's like that thing of people getting in, people wanting to get into your house. Yeah. They'll do it if they want to do it. When I walk by, this is awful. I shouldn't admit this. When I walk by a house, I'm like, I could get into that house. Like I'm just like, this is what's wrong with this person. I could, I could, I want to get into their house to be like, look at, I'm in here. Should I be in here? No, no. And you live on a busy street and I snuck right in. I have that feeling in New York all the time, but it's almost like the opposite where you can look into people's like apartment windows in the front. But it almost feels like, like the, because it's so common, it's not as, it's not as inviting because it just happens all the time. People are used to being able to see right into someone's life. Yeah, don't do it. Don't do that. Well, tickling tickling is a much funnier thing to end on than a toothless, I mean, it's slightly up. I think he was a little molestier than, you know, the tick, the petal when ticklers kind of a fun, it's like the hair burglar where it's like, yeah, actually it was. Did you just say the hamburger? Yeah. But I messed it up. I love it. I tried to put the word dick in there. I was laughing over a hamd. Decapitated. Send us, to my favorite murder, send us your hometown stories. We fucking love them. Yeah. It doesn't have to be a murder, even like crime, like crazy crimes, something creepy, like a Cropsey story, the woods. Oh, and people who live near the woods, they have creepy woods. Yeah. And then go to iTunes and review us and subscribe and do those things that help us. Please rate, review, rate, review, subscribe. Yeah. Yeah. Please do that. Because like, you know, two women hosting a podcast. Let's please. Let's beat the men. I'm making this feminist out of nowhere. You're gonna be good, like you didn't believe in us, like two women hosting a podcast. This thing's bullshit. No, I mean, like, don't you guys want us to do well? Because we're two women and we're like, yeah, Hillary, do you hear us? Yeah, I'm making this feminist immediately. Don't, don't kill women. It really is ultimately. Yeah. It's a feminist movement. It is. I'm talking about murder. We're fucking feminists. Is that all? Anything else? I know. Any final thoughts? Don't murder us. This really seems like a concern of yours. I see you. I was just thinking, like, I don't want to talk about it because I'm just going to convince someone to kill me by telling them why I think it's possible because they should do it because it'll help. I have to say, I feel ready. I've been prepared for so long. That was Karen, by the way. I just want everyone to know that was Karen who said that. Oh my God, I've been like, I'm going to prepare my speech for what happens like to the news. Like, I just didn't, we didn't know. Here's your speech. She asked for it straight up, intentionally recorded it, set it into a microphone. All right. Thanks for listening, guys.",

That's just like,\"},{\"currTime\":430,\"text\":\"and she's, she's just a fucking kid. Yeah. Yeah. So if those who don't know, don't know anything,\"},{\"currTime\":439,\"text\":\"apparently. Martha Moxley. In 1975, she was a 15 year old girl living in Greenwich,\"},{\"currTime\":446,\"text\":\"Connecticut, which is a fucking Tony town. Love the word Tony. Don't they have like their own\"},{\"currTime\":452,\"text\":\"gates and stuff? It's like truly like crazy rich. Yeah. And it's like you live on acres. Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":459,\"text\":\"So Martha Moxley's body was found beaten in her yard the night after Halloween.\"},{\"currTime\":465,\"text\":\"And it was, she was beaten. They found half of a golf club there, which is what had been used to\"},{\"currTime\":472,\"text\":\"beat her. She's like a cute, pretty, it doesn't matter. She could be ugly. It's still terrible.\"},{\"currTime\":478,\"text\":\"But she's, you know, she was fucking so that the person they thought she looks like a girl that's\"},{\"currTime\":483,\"text\":\"in a black and white picture in an 80s year book. She's like that perfect girl. Like the popular,\"},{\"currTime\":488,\"text\":\"but like, but she's also on student body. Like she's popular and smart and she's not mean, you\"},{\"currTime\":493,\"text\":\"know? Yeah. Freckles. Totally. Genuine smile. Like she'd probably end up being like a, like a,\"},{\"currTime\":498,\"text\":\"like a lawyer for like the ocean, you know, those guys. Yeah. Like a lawyer defending like.\"},{\"currTime\":506,\"text\":\"Actually getting something good done. Oshah. Is that a thing? Oshah, yes. But Oshah is the work,\"},{\"currTime\":513,\"text\":\"the work environment, making sure, making sure it's safe for people to work.\"},{\"currTime\":517,\"text\":\"There, she'd be, she'd be a lawyer for them. Okay. I like the ocean too. It's kind of nice.\"},{\"currTime\":524,\"text\":\"She just has dolphins all around her. Anyhow. She totally has dolphins. So the person who ended up\"},{\"currTime\":530,\"text\":\"ultimately getting arrested and put in jail for this murder, but not until 2002 was her neighbor\"},{\"currTime\":536,\"text\":\"who lived across the street who was her age named Michael Skakel, who this is so unimportant and\"},{\"currTime\":543,\"text\":\"such a stupid fact of the, the whole thing. But probably the reason why it's a famous murder is\"},{\"currTime\":548,\"text\":\"that the Michael Skakel's family was related to Senator Robert Kennedy's wife, Ethel Kennedy,\"},{\"currTime\":558,\"text\":\"Ethel Skakel Kennedy, who RFK has been in on this podcast. So my favorite murder in the past.\"},{\"currTime\":566,\"text\":\"Anyways. So what's recently happened is that Michael Skakel has been released from jail.\"},{\"currTime\":572,\"text\":\"Oh, I didn't know that. They filed for a new trial because he was not adequately represented by\"},{\"currTime\":579,\"text\":\"his defense attorney. Doubt it. The habeas petition was granted. The judgment of conviction is set\"},{\"currTime\":586,\"text\":\"aside and the matter is referred back. So for retrial, meaning as far as I know, so he got out\"},{\"currTime\":593,\"text\":\"and as far as I know, it doesn't look like they're pursuing the case anymore. Because I guess,\"},{\"currTime\":598,\"text\":\"you know, they had very little, it was all circumstantial evidence. Not even that wasn't\"},{\"currTime\":605,\"text\":\"very strong. So surprising that he got convicted. However, he admitted that that night somewhere\"},{\"currTime\":612,\"text\":\"between 10 and two in the morning or something like that, he was in a tree masturbating while\"},{\"currTime\":620,\"text\":\"looking in Martha Moxley's window. Yes, that was the justification of why his semen would be on her\"},{\"currTime\":626,\"text\":\"body was on her body. Yeah. Okay, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. Right.\"},{\"currTime\":633,\"text\":\"I mean, clearly, he had pretty good lawyers the first time around if they're coming up with\"},{\"currTime\":636,\"text\":\"shit like that. It's just I know this is insane bias because I've seen this like so many versions\"},{\"currTime\":641,\"text\":\"of this story. But it's but I've decided I've decided. But I mean, it's because of things like\"},{\"currTime\":647,\"text\":\"that. Well, the problem with it is that there's other there's other strong suspects, you know,\"},{\"currTime\":653,\"text\":\"like the brother, the brother who was making out with her that evening, which is why maybe\"},{\"currTime\":661,\"text\":\"Michael got jealous and killed her. Or did she catch him drinking off? Like, how did she come\"},{\"currTime\":667,\"text\":\"out there, do you suppose? Well, I don't think I think she was out because it was mischief night,\"},{\"currTime\":673,\"text\":\"right? Was it the night before Halloween or Halloween? It was Yeah, sorry, I know you're so\"},{\"currTime\":679,\"text\":\"the night before Halloween. Yeah, mischief night, which I didn't know was a thing. I know it's not\"},{\"currTime\":683,\"text\":\"a thing out here. I think it's it might be for exclusively for rich white people in Greenwich.\"},{\"currTime\":688,\"text\":\"It's also in Detroit, which is terrifying. Oh, yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":693,\"text\":\"A slightly different tone of that every night is mischief night in Detroit. Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":698,\"text\":\"Yeah, I've never heard of mischief night mischief night until I heard this story. Yeah, me too.\"},{\"currTime\":702,\"text\":\"So yeah. So like, the most obvious answer is usually the correct answer. Yeah. And\"},{\"currTime\":711,\"text\":\"and him jerking off in a tree and not being the killer is not the obvious answer. That's right.\"},{\"currTime\":719,\"text\":\"Well, and also just then, why weren't there other people? Even, you know, like, it just didn't seem\"},{\"currTime\":725,\"text\":\"like there was other people brought forward because this is one of not just a safe town or whatever.\"},{\"currTime\":730,\"text\":\"It's like an exclusive shut off city. Yeah, but here's the thing is there, the Skakles had a\"},{\"currTime\":738,\"text\":\"had a tutor named John, let's see where they write on something foreign. Ken, Ken Littleton.\"},{\"currTime\":749,\"text\":\"Oh, okay. So he was the tutor and they were like, this guy's sketchy. And so he was a suspect for\"},{\"currTime\":754,\"text\":\"a long time too. Why was he sketchy? Do you remember? Because maybe he had a hard on for\"},{\"currTime\":760,\"text\":\"Martha Moxley. Oh, okay. But he says he never even met her. Okay, but then so recently,\"},{\"currTime\":765,\"text\":\"Kobe Bryant, here's another like relative, Kobe Bryant's cousin. His name is Tony Bryant.

    "transcript_text": " We at Wondery live, breathe and downright obsess over true crime and now we're launching the ultimate true crime fan experience, Exhibit C. Join now by following Wondery, Exhibit C on Facebook and listen to true crime on Wondery and Amazon Music, Exhibit C. It's truly criminal. Let's talk about murder. Let's get it done. Let's get into murder. Let's get, let's get our murder chores taken care of. Let's vacuum the murder and take out the murder. Let's vacuum up the hair follicles and the carpet fibers that will not be admissible in court. Right. And then just throw them out. Yeah. Because they're just garbage. And then we'll overturn the conviction. We'll overturn history. Okay. So, hi, this is my favorite murder. That's Karen. And that's Georgian. We're here to talk about crime and punishment and all the things that we like that a lot of people really don't. Well, it turns out I feel like so many people are emailing us and being like, thank you. That they do. Yeah. Yeah. I'm always too embarrassed to talk about it with anyone. Do you think even, like, even grammar school teachers and even cheerleaders have these feelings? Yeah. I think most women like to talk about murder. Yeah. Yeah. And some dudes. Some dudes do. Okay. Well, here's the thing I read recently. Did you know there's, they have like an age range that you'll most likely, like, this is when, this is when your chances of getting murdered are the war or this age, like, they have an exact age. And this is from paranoia magazine. No, this is from fucking psychology today. Okay. Similar. Okay. It was a relief because we're both older than this age. Okay, good. So, the average age of homicide victims into what this last time I guess was 2008 was 32.7 years old. And then the average age of murderers in 2008 was 28.8. Whoa. Interesting. Yeah. Like, that's very young seems to me to get murdered or to murder. To be a murderer that seems young. I would have guessed old younger personally, you would have guessed younger for the murder because you have less control over your impulses and that sort of thing. But by 28, you're like, I'm going to be a murderer definitely or no. I want, you know what it is to I think when I think of stuff like this, I'm thinking of the specific kind of murders that I'm interested in where obviously this is gang, mafia, all, you know, impulse, all that stuff. Spousal abuse. The crimes of passion. Crimes of partial. Crimes of portion. What about, you know what I'm really afraid of? Getting shot at on the freeway. Oh, yeah. What about someone throwing a brick over an off and overpass onto your windshield? Don't do that. No, don't do that. Does it happen to people? There was like, sometimes there's, there's like, I was going to say spates of that, but I'm not sure if that's the right word. That's terrifying. Little that starts happenings in certain parts of that's that's a very Los Angeles thing. No. Sure. I know. I gotta go. Okay, bye. I gotta go. I gotta go. And then to be and to be murdered 32. That sounds right because you're like, you're out of your twenties. You kind of like you relax into adulthood. You think you got it together. You no longer carry your keys between your fingers at night. You're kind of like, look, I lived in the city long enough. You let your shoulders down a little bit. You relax. Yeah. The fun kind of murders that we like, that's like your fucking college co-ed. Yeah. Not fun. And I don't like them. Just to clear this up. Whatever. We simply must demand understanding from our audience. That's what we're going to have to stop explaining that a, we don't want to be murdered by anyone. We're not like, you know why is because I did made the fatal mistake of not only reading some of our iTunes reviews that were bad, which there were very few. So I went straight to them and then telling you about them. And like the funniest one was one who was like, these women have no respect. They're laughing about child death or whatever. And so I keep feeling like I have to clarify or be apologetic. Call her and be like, let me tell you about this. I pictured it to be an old man with horn rim glasses and kind of half balding, kind of like an old Bob Oden Kirk is the way I was picturing it. Yeah, just like a crooked finger shaking, shaking at the screen always. You women is grandson comes and boots it up for him every day. Totally. Yeah, we just said, we can't worry. We have to be talking to the people that understand us. Yeah, they get us. They do. And they like it. Like you're saying, they're excited. I was going to ask you a question and then I forgot it. I'm just going to keep telling each other that people like murder. They like it. Yeah. Why would they be listening to a podcast called my favorite murder? Yeah, they're people are much smarter than the media would have you believe. That's true. Do you want to go first? You want to talk about your favorite murder? Yeah. Well, so we I was so we're maybe after this one, we're going to start having categories each time. Sure. Like call a theme. Yeah, theme. Totally. So we're not right now. So I was just like in the wind, twisting in the wind to grab one tip for why it's been harder. Yeah. So you want to you go first? That's my point. Oh, okay. No, wait, why don't I go first? And then you yours is probably really well researched. Why? Because I have a legal pad. I just carry that around with me like a nerd. There's nothing written like the same word written over and over and over again. It just says murder Georgia over and over on it. But at this whole time, it was you that murdered me. Oh my God. Yeah, that's the great irony of life. It's always what's right in front of you. Nice to meet you. Meet my murderer. All right. Well, mine is my favorite murder this week is one that I'm sure you know about. And it's a classic. I feel like I just need to get out of the way because whenever there's been recent news updates about it. And whenever I see it, whenever I watch a documentary about it, I'm fucking in it. Yeah. It's the murder of Martha Moxley. Georgia, you know, I got to tell you. Yeah, just the name Martha Moxley. Moxley, the word Moxley. It's the best name. And it's the worst story. That's just like, and she's, she's just a fucking kid. Yeah. Yeah. So if those who don't know, don't know anything, apparently. Martha Moxley. In 1975, she was a 15 year old girl living in Greenwich, Connecticut, which is a fucking Tony town. Love the word Tony. Don't they have like their own gates and stuff? It's like truly like crazy rich. Yeah. And it's like you live on acres. Yeah. So Martha Moxley's body was found beaten in her yard the night after Halloween. And it was, she was beaten. They found half of a golf club there, which is what had been used to beat her. She's like a cute, pretty, it doesn't matter. She could be ugly. It's still terrible. But she's, you know, she was fucking so that the person they thought she looks like a girl that's in a black and white picture in an 80s year book. She's like that perfect girl. Like the popular, but like, but she's also on student body. Like she's popular and smart and she's not mean, you know? Yeah. Freckles. Totally. Genuine smile. Like she'd probably end up being like a, like a, like a lawyer for like the ocean, you know, those guys. Yeah. Like a lawyer defending like. Actually getting something good done. Oshah. Is that a thing? Oshah, yes. But Oshah is the work, the work environment, making sure, making sure it's safe for people to work. There, she'd be, she'd be a lawyer for them. Okay. I like the ocean too. It's kind of nice. She just has dolphins all around her. Anyhow. She totally has dolphins. So the person who ended up ultimately getting arrested and put in jail for this murder, but not until 2002 was her neighbor who lived across the street who was her age named Michael Skakel, who this is so unimportant and such a stupid fact of the, the whole thing. But probably the reason why it's a famous murder is that the Michael Skakel's family was related to Senator Robert Kennedy's wife, Ethel Kennedy, Ethel Skakel Kennedy, who RFK has been in on this podcast. So my favorite murder in the past. Anyways. So what's recently happened is that Michael Skakel has been released from jail. Oh, I didn't know that. They filed for a new trial because he was not adequately represented by his defense attorney. Doubt it. The habeas petition was granted. The judgment of conviction is set aside and the matter is referred back. So for retrial, meaning as far as I know, so he got out and as far as I know, it doesn't look like they're pursuing the case anymore. Because I guess, you know, they had very little, it was all circumstantial evidence. Not even that wasn't very strong. So surprising that he got convicted. However, he admitted that that night somewhere between 10 and two in the morning or something like that, he was in a tree masturbating while looking in Martha Moxley's window. Yes, that was the justification of why his semen would be on her body was on her body. Yeah. Okay, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. Right. I mean, clearly, he had pretty good lawyers the first time around if they're coming up with shit like that. It's just I know this is insane bias because I've seen this like so many versions of this story. But it's but I've decided I've decided. But I mean, it's because of things like that. Well, the problem with it is that there's other there's other strong suspects, you know, like the brother, the brother who was making out with her that evening, which is why maybe Michael got jealous and killed her. Or did she catch him drinking off? Like, how did she come out there, do you suppose? Well, I don't think I think she was out because it was mischief night, right? Was it the night before Halloween or Halloween? It was Yeah, sorry, I know you're so the night before Halloween. Yeah, mischief night, which I didn't know was a thing. I know it's not a thing out here. I think it's it might be for exclusively for rich white people in Greenwich. It's also in Detroit, which is terrifying. Oh, yeah. A slightly different tone of that every night is mischief night in Detroit. Yeah. Yeah, I've never heard of mischief night mischief night until I heard this story. Yeah, me too. So yeah. So like, the most obvious answer is usually the correct answer. Yeah. And and him jerking off in a tree and not being the killer is not the obvious answer. That's right. Well, and also just then, why weren't there other people? Even, you know, like, it just didn't seem like there was other people brought forward because this is one of not just a safe town or whatever. It's like an exclusive shut off city. Yeah, but here's the thing is there, the Skakles had a had a tutor named John, let's see where they write on something foreign. Ken, Ken Littleton. Oh, okay. So he was the tutor and they were like, this guy's sketchy. And so he was a suspect for a long time too. Why was he sketchy? Do you remember? Because maybe he had a hard on for Martha Moxley. Oh, okay. But he says he never even met her. Okay, but then so recently, Kobe Bryant, here's another like relative, Kobe Bryant's cousin. His name is Tony Bryant. Okay. Like why are there, there needs to be, you know, connections to family members that are famous, I don't know, says that he knows who killed Martha Moxley. He's from this town. Oh, and he came out recently and said, I know who actually did it. And it wasn't Michael's Gecko. No. He says it was two of his friends who lived in or they love the Bronx, I believe. Yeah, two friends visiting him from the Bronx, they went to Moxley's neighborhood the night of the murder and this guy Bryant was with them. The two friends reportedly picked up Skakles golf clubs from Skakles yard, which is what she was murdered with, on a whim and told Bryant they wanted to attack a girl quote caveman style using the clubs. Bryant says he left the neighborhood and learned about the murder later and the friends told him they committed a crime, but he never said anything. So now he's saying he's coming forward with the story. If the story is true, I call bullshit on him leaving. He was, he was there. People are going to tell you to your face, they're going to kill a girl and you're like, well, I've got to go. So kind of person. I mean, look, whatever, there's all details. You could run a million scenarios. I don't think a teenager would be like would leave even if he was like, I don't want to murder anyone. I just want to see what happens. Or I don't believe these guys, you know, well, the other thing I remember hearing is that the Skakles golf clubs, the, the set of clubs were in their attic that the cops found them later with that one club missing. So the idea that they were picking golf clubs out of a front yard seems a bit bullshitty. Or did someone stash the golf clubs up there after they realized the murder weapon was a golf club or that could be connected to them? Yeah. Did Michael Skakel do it, put the golf clubs up there, the dad, the mom, weren't the dad and the mom gone? They were gone. Like they, they, dad and mom almost didn't live there. They were like teen boys that lived on their own. Rich white teen boys running amok that lived on their own. That sounds terrible. Now, am I wrong to assume that Kobe Bryant's cousin is black and that the kids coming in from whatever, but did you say Brooklyn or the Bronx coming in from the Bronx or black? That's an assumption we couldn't make. I would, I would think that the Greenwich Connecticut cops would see three black kids walking around on mischief night and at least ask a question. Totally. If not harass the fuck out of them. And then how did Michael Skakel seem in a gift to go back and get on this poor girl, this poor girl in her poor, every interview, like her family is like die hard. Like we never did anything else with our lives, but try to get justice. Yeah. It's fucking heartbreaking for this poor family. There's, I remember, I remember seeing this story way early in a, it wasn't forensic files, but it was like one of those ones and they interviewed the mom. Oh, she's, she seemed like a thousand miles away. I remember watching it and just going, Oh, I never want to see any, any murder victims, mom speak again, because that's the most painful thing. You know what hurts me? The brothers, brothers of the murder victims always bought me out because they're like, I should have been there to help my little sister. Yeah. Oh, terrible. Well, also, I don't like the idea that so he has served, was it 30 years in prison or 20? No, he didn't get arrested until 2002. Oh, so this is crazy, like white people justice, where it's a rich guy who basically kind of did a symbolic time and now they're faking out about some black people to say, Hey, maybe we did it. And then his thing goes away. Probably. So he got, he didn't, Michael Skickl didn't get arrested until and convicted for 27 years. He was free. That was this, this whole, so this whole thing happened. I think it was 2002. So I remember having watched the whole story of the murder and then like that happened, it was insane. I never thought he would get anyone would get arrested for it. And now he's fucking out again. So he spent, he sent spent a couple years. I just think that the logic of, oh, wait, so 2000, he was arrested. And then, yeah, now he's out. Yeah, the logic of, oh, just the logic of a very rich, teen boy who gets spurned and maybe even shamed, like his older brother who ruins his life in every other way gets the girl that he likes, him having this huge, crazy emotional reaction in the moment that he maybe hugely regrets even, but that it may be even a girl that he was obsessed with, that sparking murderous ramp, a murderous rampage makes way more sense than just a teen going, I'm going to kill a girl tonight caveman style. Like you have to be a very specific type of person to be able to do that in the first place. It's not, it's not like going, I'm going to sniff glue. And then there were two, two other kids at Michael Skakeles boarding school later who said, yeah, he admitted to it. Yeah. So these kids from the Bronx would have probably gone back and bragged about it. And there would have been more people saying that they did it, not Kobe Bryant's cousin. Yeah. But I just hate that idea that, I mean, it, most black people have a hard time driving around Los Angeles, California, you're going to roll up into Greenwich, Connecticut and just be like, let's see what we can do murder wise. Like wander around with clubs. I don't think so. No, yeah, you're right. Also, if you live in the Bronx, where you're getting the gas money, where you're getting any of the money to get there. Yeah. Like, I don't know, it doesn't, it just doesn't add up as quickly to me. It's just, it's, but what's, yeah, I don't know. But who knows. And I just don't understand why this guy who has a family, Kobe Bryant's cousin would want to do that. But there's fucking narcissistic people who want attention all the time. Or maybe he really believes it. Maybe he believes it. And maybe he doesn't, he's remembering incorrectly. He really believes that's what happened. I, here's what I will say. I love the idea that we still get to talk about the Martha Moxley murder, that there's something still happening with it. Yeah. That's fascinating to me. No one's in prison for her murder still. Yeah. Did I want Michael Skakel not to have done it? Like I want there to be a different answer, but I don't think there is. I just think that, I think that the thing that comes down to with me with a lot of these stories is my irritation over the fact that people accept kind of like, like if you're a white guy wearing a button down Oxford shirt, you can kind of do whatever the fuck you want. And people will be like, Oh no, that nice boy down the street. Like you can, you get to hide in plain sight with this camouflage and meanwhile be whatever. And people will not believe it. They'll immediately believe three black kids driving up from the Bronx to kill this one girl. It's just such a bummer because I think what I don't want him to be guilty is because he is such a fucking loser and such a little twerp that he doesn't deserve. I want it to be more sensational because she deserves to not have just been killed by this little jerking off little shit face. Yeah, who is jealous of a thing. That's a that's like a friend zone murder. That's what that is. Yeah, or like you want to fuck my brother and not me. I'm jealous. Yeah, yeah, which is such an obvious boring. I get this is why I like cold cases is because you can you can like imagine that it's more complicated and mysterious and bigger within the answer, which is usually the answer is just some fucking dude didn't take his meds and went crazy. And it's like, and this guy's a piece of sword and this guy's a piece of shit and the murder victim was a good person who deserved who and I always think like, just kill yourself. Don't kill someone else. Please just kill yourself. I mean, that was if they had any kind of nobility about them whatsoever. Well, and also the other thing too is you can't just leave kids just because you're rich or just because you can like get a tutor. You especially like teen boys are the ones that need to be like observed and written and like, you know, discipline constantly, they have to be there have to be boundaries. No impulse control. No, and it's the 70s. So they were like on drugs and smoking pot and drinking all the time. They did whatever they wanted. I mean, yeah, that's it's to me in my mind. It's much more likely that a rich kid or super rich teenage boy would murder a girl who has too much privilege and affluence and has always gotten away with whatever he wants. We're we're Kennedys. Yeah, we're the Kennedys of Greenwich, right? Yeah. Yeah, come on. Yeah. Oh, man. Fuck. Hey, I'm Mike Corey, the host of Wunderies podcast against the odds. In our next season, three mask men hijacked a school bus full of children in the sleepy farm town of Chautchilla, California. They bury the children and their bus driver deep underground, planning to hold them for ransom. Local police and the FBI marshal a search effort, but the trail quickly runs dry. As the air supply for the trapped children dwindles, a pair of unlikely heroes emerges. Follow against the odds wherever you get your podcast, you can listen, add free on the Amazon music or Wundery app. It's your murder. Well, my so I picked mine because we were talking about hitchhiking and laughing about how insanely dangerous and crazy hitchhiking is. And so I went to look up why we think that and know that and what the story with the actual stories and murders are behind that. And it turns out, that there I looked up freeway killer because I remember hearing there was like the story of the one guy with the van on the freeway. It turns out there were three. Wow. And between like the mid seventies and 1980, there were three serial killers that dumped bodies on freeways in Los Angeles and Southern California, working all at the same time in this area in this area. And on top of that, the in the same amount in the same time frame where the hillside stranglers. Yeah. And so they weren't even counted in this because they dumped bodies. Yeah, but they dumped bodies in the hills. So they would take women off the street. Okay. And then they would they it was where they were dumping in the hills. That's what they call them hillside. They thought it was one guy doing it like as if they were walking up there and then realize they were bringing bodies to there. I just think it's crazy that when two people joined forces and are both in agreement that they want to do the same. Like it's insane. How do you find someone like that? Okay, you're that's exactly right. And here's why I love the story. Because the guy I focused on is William Bonnan. He had four accomplices over his, I believe it was just a year or it was like a year and a half where he was doing the most most of these killers killings. Sorry. And he had four different people who helped him. That's insane. It's crazy. Something was going on in the late 70s, because that's also when Bundy, when John Wayne Gacy, like it was all around 1978. There was this weird explosion of like, maybe it was just that people learned about what it was and the story started coming out. Like Dahmer was later, right? Dahmer was later. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, or because the term serial killer wasn't even coined Intel, but I didn't mean that they weren't doing it. They weren't doing that. Right. Just don't think people understood. That's right. Yeah. They didn't. And also, how do you introduce that concept to like without introducing huge mass panic? So one of the guys, I'll just tell you the other ones first. One was the scorecard killer. And this was a guy named Randy Kraft. So from 1972 to 1983, he killed for sure 16 boys, but they think 51 and 51. And there was also so and he they call him scorecard killer, because he kept this really long list where he had code words for the people that he killed. So they were able to track. That's why they know it's at least 51. Because there would just be a word that would say like tank top or whatever that would somehow relate to the victim. Yeah, it's crazy. And he was like the he looked like anyone in the store when you see pictures. He looks like a high school teacher. Holy shit. He looks like he would have been on a episode of episode of Mary Tyler Moore. He has like kind of a pointy nose. And like he has kind of a jolly looking face. He's like he's a guy in the 70s. A guy in the 70s just like, Hey, come on, do you need a ride? And he would pick up little kids. He would pick up men of any kind. Okay. And then he would brutally he would brutally rape them and then dump their bodies. There was also Patrick Wayne Kearney, who worked from 75 to 77 who killed definitely 28. Shit, that's two years he killed 28 people 28 and they think 43 they just can only pin 28 on him. Yeah, like there's no way he didn't start earlier and they just don't know yet. Right, exactly. And especially because at this time, imagine three of these people doing this at once. And this guy would pick up hitchhikers, shoot them in the head, then do stuff to their bodies and then wrap them in trash bags. And keep their heads? Is that him? No. Not that I know of. That's I mean, no, I don't think so. I think that's a anyways, yeah. This is one of these people? No. Well, anyway, imagine like living right now and like, like how, you know, summer of Sam how like, yeah, there's a person killing people out there right now, like I just wouldn't leave the house anymore. I know. And three, three at a time, three of them that at any given time could be driving down any fucking street. But the key in this in all three of these and the reason that they didn't go that they went on solve for so long is because they were gay. It was gay boys. And it was it was that situation of boy hitchhikers, usually young and for William Bonnan, his youngest was 12, a little boy who was trying to get to Disneyland. And but William Bonnan is like the worst, the worst of the worst. We can just go through his super quick because it's just a humongous bummer. He's kind of got shades of Charles Manson in that way where it was never okay for him from day one. Yeah. So he he was born to two alcoholic parents. And the mom left him and his two brothers with her father, whom molested her and whom molested the boys. Then he he ran away when he was nine and he got arrested for stealing license plates and he got sent to a boys, you know, like juvie basically for boys where he was again raped and molested. And there's a super dark story. This is if you don't like dark things, this will bum you out. So spoiler alert. Spoil your life alert. Let's just spoil. Spoiler. Spoil your life. They told a story of the first time he was someone approached him in this in juvie to say that they were going to like fuck him essentially. And he asked the boy to tie his hands behind his back first because it made him feel safe. That's how badly he was being molested by his grandfather. So he was we can talk about this person and at least draw a strain of like with that why question that I always have with this like you cannot torture human beings like this. How do you create a failure or serial killer? Yeah, just follow this guy's life. Yeah, basically, you know, neglect. They were like the neighborhood people said that they look like they were starving all the time. They were like, you know, they were completely neglected children who then of course became criminals because what else were they going to do? That's the thing of like, where do you go? Where at what point do you switch from feeling sorry for this child to thinking that this man should be dead? You know, like, right? There's there's like a moment. I guess it's when he kills the first person you ever go. Yeah, because there's a lot of people that get molested and fucked with as children who never do anything bad to other people. Totally. There's definitely that element of responsibility, but it's just like you just see that thing where like that mother couldn't be responsible enough to go. I'm going to get you out of this cycle of abuse and not let what happened to me happen to you. But how horrible that is. So anyway, he goes to he of course, then when he gets out of like that juvie, he starts molesting kids in the neighborhood. It's just like now with the thing that he does, he he gets arrested for it once, then he gets sent to I think he goes to Vietnam has a full tour in the air. He joins the Air Force. He came back. He was in Vietnam from 69 to 71 came back and immediately started kidnapping and raping boys. He did it to five boys. Can you imagine the second fondling he did in Vietnam? Yeah. Like that was like a free for all for him. Yeah, you could do anything you wanted. So he comes back. He gets caught for kidnapping and raping five different boys. They send him to a mental hospital. Oh, great. So he goes from being in a mental hospital in the mental hospital. They say he's he can't be rehabilitated. So they send him to real jail. But then he's released in 1974 because there they decide he's no longer a danger to others. You've got to be kidding me. Uh-huh. And so 16 months later, he's charged with the gunpoint rape of a 14 year old hitchhiker and the attempted abduction of another teen. So he's sentenced from one to 15 years to in jail. From one to 15 years. One to 15 years. How cute is that? Yeah. Just, you know, go think about what you did for a little while. A year. That you've been doing your entire life. The fucking penal system of all these stories of horrific things. I'm usually the most disturbed and disgusted by how little time people get for heinous. Yeah. The crimes. Well, as when when our rape and child molestering going to start be being really seen as like these are people who should not be in should not be getting out in six months. I don't know. You're going to stop putting a fucking statute of limitations on prosecuting people for rape. Yeah. There's a statute of limitations. Sure. For rape and kidnapping. Yeah. How fucking, how fuck that was that? Yeah, it's insane. So the cops can't find the dude who raped and kidnapped you for 15 years. You got away. He's free now. Sure. Do what you want. It's insane. Boys will be boys. Yeah. So he's released from jail and he moved to Downey and I was just in Downey and I read the I had breakfast and I read the criminal section of their newspaper. Anything exciting happening down there was a home invasion robbery here. Oh, okay. It's not too bad. So there he he they later found out that he murdered a 13 year old hitchhiker, but he was ultimately arrested for molesting a boy and Dana point should have gone back to prison because he was on parole at the time. But due to a clerical error, clerical, clerical error, he was released. Someone spelled his last name wrong. Exactly. He walked right out of the jail and he got picked up by his main accomplice for all of these murders. A man named, what is it, something but something, something but it's a classic name. So anyway, and that's when he tells he tells butts. Now there's not going to be any more witnesses. That's what you're creating when you keep letting these people when you keep arresting them for one to 15 years is that they learn the lesson not to let anyone identify them right by so you should kill them. Yeah. So then he makes this what they ended up calling like the death machine or something and it's this green Fort O'Connor line van that he's got chains. He's got like handcuffs. He's got all this stuff and they would pick up hitchhikers and there would be the butts guy would be in the back and then they basically he'd like pull over and like attack and rape and he, he was a big strangler. He, for most of his victims, he strangled them with a t-shirt. And that's how, that's how he killed most of them. And Vernon butts, that was his first name. Vernon butts. And they also were lovers. And they played Dungeons and Dragons in the sewer system of Los Angeles. That was just a small detail that I wrote on the side of here that I remembered and I just am fascinated. That's a lot to comprehend. Just if we could kind of go into that for quite some time, but I find that fascinating. This isn't a gaming podcast. Otherwise we would get deep into Vernon butts. So into it. Oh, so, oh, so basically it's just he then, it was basically a year long tear where they went and picked up, you know, what they think is, I think he got prosecuted, what did I say? He got prosecuted for 16. No, he got prosecuted for 14, but they think he did 44 murders. That is the most staggering number. And I think people were getting fucking kidnapped left and right. Just boys disappearing everywhere. And apparently there was a reporter at the Orange County Register, which is, as you know, the Orange County is very Republican, very white Republican kind of Christian area in Southern California. And he found an envelope, the Southern County Register with all the paper clippings of all these different individual stories of hitchhikers or bodies that were found murdered. And the, on the front of the envelope, it said dead gay boys. So he was like, why isn't anybody looking at this as like, like some trend at the very least. He kind of wrote, I think he wrote a book, he wrote something about that I was reading part of that was basically all about how the attitude was like, well, too bad for them because they signed up for that lifestyle. It's the same as prostitutes. Yeah. It's like, well, they live a, what was it, a high risk lifestyle? Right. They chose to live a high risk lifestyle. Yeah. Which is, so, oh, okay, you're right. So then any serial killer should get to do whatever he wants. Yeah. Yeah. That's bananas. It's super crazy. I mean, just the thought of, of knowing that there were those people out there. I mean, there are now, but like in your fucking working actively in your, in your, in your hood, in your hood, well, and also down here. I mean, there's so, there was so much murder down here and also 78 was the same year as Jones town. Like there was something, there was something in the air. You know what I think of like, when I think of like murder in the 70s and 80s and like how like people were so minors were unaccompanied, like just as a rule, like you could go and do your own thing. We would, we would leave and be gone all day and then come back when it's dark. Yep. Like picture a fucking, a fucking arcade and like all the kids that were just hanging out in arcades and all the perverts that were probably working there. Yes. Like intentionally working at an arcade. Cause kids would be there. Yeah. I mean, it's a scarier, it's a scary thing to know, like to have the information, but it's such a better time for children health wise. Yeah. I think in all those ways. Cause it's like, yeah, if you have kids, you probably should know where they are all the time. Yeah. And you should probably make sure there's an adult with them. That's responsible. Definitely. Definitely. If we leave, if we leave you with anything this week, yeah, don't let your kid and then like the kids who, you know, we stayed at home alone every day. We were latchkey kids. We were too. Me and my sister. Crazy. So crazy. One day we went to get dropped off and we just at the last minute decided to get dropped off at my aunt's house cause she lived next door and our house was being robbed at the time. Oh my God. Of that decision. Are you serious? I swear to God, my uncle saw the guy walking out our front door with stuff under his arm as he drove by and so he called the cops. Holy, the guy get caught? No. Holy shit. If you had fucking walked in on a burglar. Yeah. At the time I think we were like eight and 10 walking in on a very large bearded man looting our house. I definitely remember being offered rides as a kid by like strange men being like, nope. I used to walk like literally a mile to school by myself. Totally. By myself. That's stupid. I used to ditch school and then I go like go hang out and it's like, oh, you could have just been, you dumb idiot. I know. We're so lucky to have survived. You know what? God bless America. You know, this is a positive time. Oh wait, no, now we get to read some of your hometown murders. We've asked you guys to send us hometown murders because we love it and you've done it and we appreciate it. We have a Facebook group, my favorite murder and we have a Gmail account, my favorite murder, so you can send us your hometown murders. I'm going to read you one Karen and you read me one. Perfect. Okay. Want me to go first? Do you want to go first? Sure. Okay. This is by Mark Schrum. Hi Mark. Hi Mark. He's very nice. He said, he said, I hope I have the right email. If not, I'm sorry for the frightening subject line because if it went to the wrong person, it just is my favorite murder. You open up your email and you're like, there's just someone describing a murder to you. Well, you would be shitting brick. Mark, he says, when I was a freshman in high school, there was a high-profile kidnapping case here in West Des Moines, Iowa. Maybe you heard of it. It was the Johnny Gorsh, Johnny Gorsh case. Yes. It's pretty well known nationwide and drug on for years and isn't a hundred percent salt for this day. This happened in 1982. He was a paper boy and was kidnapped while doing his paper route one morning. Didn't they just find his bike and that's it? Yeah, I think so. There was another boy, Eugene Martin, that was taken in 1984. Same story. He was a paper boy. My story comes in in 1983 when I was a paper boy. Mark, your mom should not have let you be a paper boy. My brother and I were delivering papers one morning and it was still dark. We were on a street that the houses were pretty far apart and set back from the road. So we weren't right on the street. I looked up the street and saw a blue panel van coming down the street extremely slow with no headlights on. As we walked, it kept following. My brother from the street, wait, my brother and I had walkie-talkies, so we were communicating about it and we decided to run and head behind the houses to get away from the street and meet up a few houses down. As we took off running, the van took off down the street and finally after a few houses turned the lights on and sped away. Was I going to be next? I guess I'll never know. About five minutes later, we saw our manager, told him and he called it into the paper dispatch. I don't know what went from there, but I was never questioned by the police and one year later Eugene was gone. Haunts me to this day, even though you are only one of the handful of people I've ever spoken to about it since it happened. Wow, Mark. He said, keep up the good work and don't ever remove the humor from the podcast. We did that, it's just depressing. We did a little bit on this one. He said, it isn't being disrespectful and you aren't going to hell. We're just coping with a fucked up world in the best way we know how and he wrote F up. Thank you. Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Mark. That's so true. It's coping. It's coping. It's coping. But wow, ground zero at the Johnny Gosh. There was no way that wasn't involved. He was in the middle between two boys, paper boys being kidnapped. I'm sorry, if you're driving a van, you should be pulled over more than people of color. Vans are, what good is happening in vans? Especially like a green van with the headlights off slowly cruising down the street. Please. You're the biggest child molester. My guy that I just did, William Bonin, had a green van who murdered so many people. It's like you're either a serial killer or you're a Scooby-Doo team. But Scooby-Doo, they were smart enough to put pink daisies on the side, which is really declare. It's a decoy. It was the mystery machine, but it actually means rape and murder. Well, also, if anyone is interested in going deeper into the Johnny Gosh kidnapping, did you listen to that last podcast on the left about, it's all about the pedophile ring and the conspiracy theory about the credit union that's in that town and the guy that runs it and this governmental conspiracy. His name is, what's the reporter's name? Yes. That's right. It's the same name as Larry King. Larry King. Larry King. That's right. Lawrence King is his name. Lawrence King. Look at that. And it's Lawrence King Credit Union. And what is it? Is it Iowa? Or where did Mark say he was from? Mark was from Des Moines. Yeah. Yeah, so it's Iowa. That's crazy. Connected. And there's like a whole thing about it being a child sex ring. He started a youth group and just befriended these kids and the kids in the town. And the documentary that I saw were like, yeah, he made us go get kids for him. Yeah. The kids talk about it. I mean, and also it's like that thing of like people, it's like no one wants to believe something would happen in Des Moines as if like, if it's a pedophile ring, it would have to be in Manhattan or something. Right. Oh, it's bad news. And the people that you trust the most are the shadiest. It's like your parents. Don't trust anyone. I feel like the pillars of the community, I mean, they're usually the creepiest. I mean, with great power comes great corruption. No, no. Power corrupts. That's the saying. Yeah, it does. The other one is. Forget it. Forget I said anything. There's a whole one out of all of those somewhere. There's a whole one, something, somewhere of ideas. Yeah. Okay. Here's mine. Let's definitely hear it. This is from Emily. I'm assuming it. You pronounce it. Maze are M A E S A R. And it's the Asheville hometown murder story. George and Karen. Nice things. And then, so I live in Asheville, North Carolina, and have since, and have since I was in kindergarten that we lived in Enka Candler, though, which is an unincorporated community on the west side of the city. When I was in elementary school, first or second grade, my sister had a friend. I say friend, but they were probably somewhere between friends and acquaintances. It was high school and it was the 90s. There was probably gray area. My sister was a sophomore, maybe 15, and so was this girl. My sister was supposed to spend the night at this girl's house, but something came up and my sister couldn't go. I was so young, though, that I can't remember if it was on our side or her friends, looking back probably the latter. That night, the girl's mother's boyfriend murdered my sister's friend. If I remember correctly, I think he wrapped her in trash bags, tied weights to her legs, dropped the body in the amazingly shallow lake where she was discovered a day or two later. I honestly have no idea if there is a sexual element to this crime. I'm inclined to say yes, only because statistically, there usually is for both women in general and specifically young women, but the internet is no help with real details, probably because it was so long ago or maybe because it was such a small town. Either way, it's a thing that I think about occasionally when I think about my sister because it's fucking terrifying. He was sentenced to a little under 17 years for murdering a teen, murdering. If he's alive now, I have no idea. He's probably out again, terrifying. Emily, thank you. That is unbelievable. That's incredible that that happened in your life. Oh my God. Yeah. Those near-miss stories are like. Those are the best. Amazing. To be that young and be like, oh, this is, things, people do this to each other. Right. Yeah. The innocence lost. Yeah. It's so intense. Yeah. A friend dying in some other, like a drunk driving accident or like a typical way is awful and terrible. Yeah. But this adds an element of like what the hell. Someone else did this thing to this person. Yeah. Oh my Lord. Wow. Under 17 years. Ooh. Jesus. He got the same amount of time that she got to live on the planet. That's. Fuck you. Bullshit. Fuck you, Judge, whoever decided that. Oh, what a, well, I bet he, that's all he could do. I bet it was like, it wasn't premeditated and I bet this guy said it was like an accident and so I just got rid of it. Right. Like this is such bullshit. The rationale behind it. Yeah. Whoa. Guys, this has been, this episode's been a lot. It's been kind of depressing. It's been a lot to handle. A lot of murders. A lot. It's a lot of stuff. That's what we do. I mean, it is what we're doing. It's what we signed up for. This was, yeah, this was an intense, this was a downer. But I do like the idea for going forward, thinking of, um, themes that would help us kind of talk about more general concepts around, right? Yeah. I mean, that's the idea that you want to do. I definitely think so. Okay. So if you have any ideas for them too, I'm thinking like, like child killers and people who kill children and, you know what I mean, like child, children who kill, you know, shootings and believe it or not. People with glass eyes. Yeah. Like a real specific, something really crazy. Yeah. Well, because I, and I know we plug this all the time, but we love last podcast on the left. It's one of my favorite podcasts, but they just recently did one about Dean Coral, who is the Candyman killer in Houston, I think. And one of the things I find so fascinating in the way, the way they do it is Marcus Parks, who is their researcher and, and provides most of like the context, the content or whatever. Yeah. And we're talking about, he got away with all these murders because there was no, at the time there was no police force. Like there was one point, something million people living there and there was like 2200 policemen, like this impossible. And there's just these things that happen in, in history and in time where like all the sudden, like in 1978 in Los Angeles, you did not want to be a teenage boy that looked slightly effeminate or hitchhiked. Like that you, your odds of living through that were very low. And that's just like these weird sine waves of, of, of the times. Yeah. Things happening all at once. It's just crazy. Yeah. A culmination of circumstances. Yeah. Yeah. I'm into it, but in a negative way, but in a fascinated way. We're trying to cope as Marcus said, I mean, Mark, what was his name? Your guy's his name. Mark. We're trying to cope. We're trying to cope when we're trying to talk about it. Anxiety. Um, so email us, your hometown murders, uh, or your favorite murder and go to the Facebook group and the Twitter, my fave murder. Oh yeah. And we, and some people are just emailing suggestions. There's lots of really good ones. So we'll get to those two, um, and suggesting someone suggested a really good documentary called the house of Suh, which I looked up and has like an 83% rating. So I'm definitely going to watch that. Yeah. Oh, there is someone on the Facebook group. Oh, I wish I had their name who's making a fucking Google doc of every suggestion we bring up for like a movie, a book, a documentary of this. That's so awesome. I know. That's very cool. If you could, if you join the Facebook group, which is closed, you'll find it on there. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. And we'll try to make them and then we'll try to convey yours that you tell us. Yeah. Awesome. Yes. I love it. So we can get a lot, a lot of listeners, you guys. Yeah. And thanks for listening. Thank you for listening. You're for us and with us. We appreciate it. Bye. Bye.",
