Oh, she's wearing something dumb, for a second, I thought that was just some bizarre blossom hat and that very well could have been, they've already established how arty she is. Dude, she, it's so annoying how hot she just is at the beginning of the movie. You say that about every woman though. That's not true. Name a woman.

You could definitely yeah, Dan Ninen That'll be so tight, which I guess people were asking they did one They want some explanation of Dan Ninen because he's come up on the show The reason I don't really talk about him is because he's it's honestly he's fucking boring at this point Right, you know, I mean Dan Ninen was funny three and a half years ago. Yeah Funny if he's new to you, but I know it's a limited gimmick. So that's like I said, I'm glad we spent 20 minutes talking about him on our show Well, that's I mean, it's boring for me because I've known Dan for like five years Yeah, I've yeah, I just found out about him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but I don't know people were asking about it And so Dan is this half Indian half Japanese comedian that was born in 1952 what is he but where does he buy a sushi? It's 7-Eleven. Yeah, why but oh Yeah, is he he's red engine or is he here Joe Robinson going off about that bid on on the Robin Joe show No, no, no, it was just like, you know, they don't sell sushi Like Walgreens, but they don't have it 7-Eleven. Does he have hearing aids on Macaulay Culkin's little brother's got hearing aids in this movie. That's deep. Oh She look just use this minute dad. I'm ugly Why did she suddenly seven years younger than she was in the last scene? They had a show Dan Ninen is Old comey. He's an old guy who started doing open mics in DC and probably like 2005 And then sort of rub people the wrong way and eventually just sort of he found it That the best path for a career day for him was going to be to lie to people lie to clubs and Bookers and say that he's like so-and-so is opener or whatever He used to he just like got Robert Schimmel's schedule and would call clubs When as soon as they booked Schimmel and like be like, hey, this is Rob Schimmel's agent. I'm trying to get the booking information For his opening opener Dan Ninen and the clubs would be like, well, what do you mean is opener? And then he'd be like, oh, yeah No, he has an opener that he brings with him that has to be there So if you could get the hotel information and then he would book Dan and after like a couple months of that I guess yeah, Schimmel Schimmel was like who the fuck is this? You know, why do they keep booking him? And then so Dan lost that and then he moved on to Russell Peters. I'm David Brenner is open Well, apparently I don't know if this is true or not, but I'm sure it is knowing Dan But when Robert Schimmel died Dan emailed Schimmel's brother and was like, yeah Robert was a fucking asshole and a piece of shit That's terrible. Oh, yeah, Dan's a sociopath. He's a fucking piece of shit. Well. He also had that Russell Peters Yeah, it does that the Russell Peters saying we you know, we're I think Russell talked about it on on what the fuck or something Dan also tried to pay like five thousand dollars to have Mark Marin have What the fuck where he reads the letter and he doesn't say Dan's name, but yeah, I'm a corporate comedian I've made more money this year than you will make in your entire life Jesus yeah, yeah, and you're too much of a coward to have me on your pod Yes, so my my exposure to Dan was through Joe Robinson, I guess and like Joe was doing that Kurt Shackelford Hyatt room and you know, he meets Dan and Dan was like hosting and Dan's talking about you know I make three hundred thousand dollars a year doing stand-up and then like, you know, Joe's like then why are you doing a $10 spot right right in the lobby of a hotel, you know, like that doesn't make any sense right at the Hyatt Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a fifty dollar spot. Thank you. All right. Well And so then fucking Dan because he's super defensive. It's like fuck Joe Robinson. Fuck Rob. Mara. Haha. Here's a picture of me and my Tesla Here's me in the cello waiting room. I don't know why you think that's a brag that he shows up too early for his train It's not like a flight. There's no security Go there and get on the fucking train and he goes there hang out in the clubhouse with no one else by the way Just a little yeah, so if you if you shit talk, Dan will put you on his enemies list And it'll just email you constantly. He really hates a GL or JL Calvin yeah, yeah Despises him so he'll bring him and Josh Homer up all the time as Guys, he's doing better. Those dude. All right, so Are we gonna talk about Dan? Yeah, we're talking. I'm just looking at it on the TV, dude It's not my fault. What's your name? With titties on this fucking screen and I'm supposed to pay attention Rachel Lee cook got some jumbo yum-yums She does dude. It distracted. Anyway, they did dude. That's the first unsheathing of her titties It's a big moment in the movie. Damn. She is fucking hot dude. All right, Nick. All right I've yes back to Dan 9 and I'm only doing it cuz people laugh Prefercest but I don't give a shit about Dan. Oh, I just look all I'm saying is got you mad if I'm at if I look at titties Yeah, I get it Hey, you know, it's a it's a PG-13 movie Fucking saucy. I don't understand. I was 30 year old man A cup breath and they're not a cup they're fucking big old titties and you know what even if they were a cups What's up? If you got some juicy a cups out there. I'm with it as well No one is going on ghosts to stop to look at the gorilla Yeah, you want raindrop drink. Yeah, I'm trying to look some gorilla pussy, dude Gorillas have like abnormally small dicks. That is true They have like well, I guess it is normal for gorillas, but they have like three centimeter long It's abnormal because they're the they have like the biggest disparity between the size of the animal and the size of their penis That's why there is that the gorilla mindset. Yeah Having extremely small dick Armadillos have four-inch dicks. Whoa the size of them That's a big-ass dick Damn, dude, that's average Yeah, now I kind of want to now I kind of want to go out there and and fuck at the armadillo To prove it wrong To establish dominance over have you ever seen an Argentinian duck now Argentine duck they have that like corkscrew penis Well, they have the nine inches Like yeah, yeah, yeah, it looks like an umbilical cork I wish I could do that with my dick, dude No, it would be consensual ducks have the cloaca they have the one-hole policy Mm-hmm. What's that for shitting and pissing and fucking fucking means whatever gender you identify as you can always fuck the duck. That's true Yeah, that's good to know dude. It's a real target policy I'm trying to get it all up in that cloaca, dude Yeah pigs ever weird dick I remember watching a video of a pig fucking a woman one time It was on e-fucked what Yeah, we're talking about this on a couple so what is e-fuck? Like really bad. Yeah UKT.com. Yeah, it's still really really despicable Scary it was scary porn stuff because you were talking about how you saw that one a guy just fucking a blowfish Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was my favorite video on there It's well It's two women in bed and they're shoving eels in their pussies and then it kind of like paint like tracks right and then you just see a Guy next to the bed and he's shoving his like a dick in this big rockfish's mouth Aren't they quite poisonous though? Yeah, but only if you eat them. Okay. Yeah, they're not poisonous They're not they're not venomous Okay, the best one is the fat virgin and the two porn stars and then they take out his pathetic penis And then they one of the poor stars gives him literally one suck And you just start six really guys rig all over miss that one. Yeah, it's a really big one was great Cuz I didn't know very funny pigs the pigs dick looks like it's tail Which is what's it's always surprises me when I think about like if I was gonna think of a funny way to draw pigs Dick without knowing what it was. I'd be like, yeah, I'll be the tail No, yeah, and then you see a pigs dick and it's the tail and it's it just sort of you know It makes me question like, you know evolution or if there is some kind of Intelligent design that that would happen. No, it's a good bit. What's that? Yeah, that would be a good bit to design a poor pigs dick, right? Yeah It doesn't make sense why that animal would have a dick that looks like that another animal stone So how did the how did the woman like it? Oh, did she had to wear a burlap sack on her back because the pigs will scratch And bite the fuck out of you. Oh God, um, but you know what I I guarantee is you know, she's on a couple of sitcoms now Real work, you know mom mom. I just need one more check and I swear things are really working out here in Santa Monica I've got really cool roommates couple of short films Lawrence Fishburne's daughter remember that or she did poor yeah, I'm gonna turn into acting Yeah, yeah, I'm a transition to act well Sasha Gray tried doing that and that's one real movie Yeah, well, she's in a movie that was directed by Brett or written by Brett Easton Ellis and Paul Schrader Yeah, apparently it's a piece of shit. No, she wasn't in that. She was in that Ronda Rousey's Dean was in that Male porn star was in that movie. Yeah, Ronda Rousey in the last fast movie was so fucking bad at acting And I feel like she's in the entourage movie too. She thinks she's gonna have an acting career and it's just not gonna happen She needs she got her shit fucked up The only without she got knocked out Ronda Rousey Ronda Rousey who's turtles girlfriend Why do you have a cool way to say it? That's how you say? No, it isn't you fucking bitch and you know it It's a South African shut up. It's a South African. Just say your fucking name Ronda Rousey was say Rousey bitch Yeah, you're not even getting it wrong. You want to have your own personal say I've heard his name is Ronda Rousey Ronda Rousey Ronda Rousey You're saying Yeah, it's Roy Roy Cohn's Roy Cohn's nephew is what about Ronda Rousey? Yeah, what about Ronda Rousey? She was in the entourage movie and she had a very romantic plot line with a turtle. Yeah, it was very romantic Do you see it? She was so bad in that that fast movie. I really doubt you'll have any kind of acting career granted I'm wrong about literally everything. Yeah, I never tried to predict anything. I was wrong about the other one With the exception of consumer electronics. I've been pretty right about those trends over the last 10 years, but There's a there's an MMA lady Gina Caron. What's her name? Carano? Yeah, Gina Carano She's been in a couple movies and she's K-Wire directed by Steven Soderbergh. Yep. She's also directed Sasha Gray in the girlfriend experience. Yeah. Yeah, Sasha Gray I don't really see her having much of a career in acting. No Oh, she's in a couple other movies. Yeah, I know. She's probably done done better than most, you know, but I think she has like a record label now or something That's true. Tracy Lawrence. Yeah. Yeah, she was great. The best actor porn porn crossover is clearly Mr. Sylvester Slime Stallone, baby the Italian stallion. Oh, uh, him and Frank Stallone, by the way, I follow them both Oh, yeah, me too. They both got to go to New Year's Eve at Mar-a-Lago with the Trump Oh My favorite You'd like Frank Stallone follow him on Instagram by the way. I definitely will love Donald Trump. It's private I love Donald Trump. That's awesome The best is the picture the Instagram of Sly Frank and Trump is they're all doing like boxing fists like But Sylvester Stallone just played a boxer in a movie like the actual boxes But they like kind of feel like the only way Frank Stallone should be allowed to tweet is by writing on his own headshots that are left in Italian restaurants And that should be his exposure to social media. Oh, that's just unveiling by the way. That's where she's at. Oh, yeah We realized that she's hot for the first time. Six pence, none the richer. Wow, dude. Hell, yeah Four foot seven. She looks better in overalls and glasses. Yeah I mean, she looks generically hot now. I'd like indie chicks. Yeah, me too. Why is the whole family there? Oh, it's not his family. No, it's her family. I think that's a comedy Do you see that part the comedy part of it where she's trips? Yeah, everyone's like nice She's still retarded though. Yeah, she still doesn't know how to walk down Was obviously parodyed in not another teen movie which starred the now Captain America one of the biggest movie stars in the world came from a parody of this movie That requires acting though. What that's not like a crazy transition. It was that was an acting I mean, you know, and really the only guy to get out of like, you know Any kind of like a sports arena in the acting and do really well as the rock Yeah, because the rocks charming as hell the other day like the rock is the only he's the only thing America has going for us Cinematically, yeah, like there's no other action stars like all the Star Wars movies. Those are all British people Right original stories. At least they were American, right? Right. That's all gone. It's the rock and Vin Diesel are like the only Like yeah, they're in movies. Absolutely. Yeah, the rock smokes him to yeah I mean, yeah, Walberg's hanging on but he's too old now And he's not he's not on that level though either the rock Yeah special about him, dude, but yeah, who do we have? Is there anybody even come? Rocks uniquely Fight no chain. It's just a pretty boy. I guess fucking what's his face? It's in all the guardian shit that everyone tries everyone So he's not See the rock is like has is good humor about like being an action star But like Chris Pratt is just too like self-referential. It's always Just does Seth Rogen's jokes, right in a hot everybody does you know and like all all the commercials now just use Seth Rogen sense of humor and it's fucking annoying and it like has penetrated so much of like screenwriting Like the Force Awakens when you know What's Adam Driver's character's name? Yeah, Darth girls He you know destroys that whole village and then Oscar Isaac's like you know They've captured him and then they're looking at each other and then Oscar Isaac's like So do like I talk now or you Whatever and it's supposed to be this comedic moment and it's like just shut the fuck up That's so stale that well they're just trying to make him Han Solo in all those movies. Everyone has to be she's doing the same It's like he's supposed to be like the wise-ass. Yeah, but there was a cliched way to go about it Yeah, funny line, but yeah, like the other like there's a scene with like Fassbender could be he's not actually he's not American He's not American. He's a German. I read got a huge dick. Have you seen it? I hated that movie. Well, it's hated it. I've never seen the movie, but I hear he fucks a lot in it So no, he doesn't I went in expecting it to be just a non-stop. No, he doesn't fuck that much He really doesn't you see that That was the moment the movie they're trying to show you like how desperate So what we say we saw we went last week we all went to go see the the Boston bombing movie We're like it's now the third movie that he's done with Peter Berg That is just like where he it's like all based on like some sort of disaster or atrocity that's happened like very recently Oh, yeah, like they started with like there is the Lone Survivor movie. Hell. Yeah, deep water. That was a good movie Lone Survivor I fucked with I saw the deep water horizon movie, too Which is like a more cinematic disaster than the Boston bombing which was right to pressure cookers exploding at a marathon Yeah, so I saw I'm gonna add it about this the other day like I think they should continue with this trend and my idea for the next Peter Berg Mark Wahlberg property is Just the pulse nightclub shooting And it's either Wahlberg could go for Oscar glory and play a gay Latin man Never survives against all odds or one of the SWAT team guys who's like we got to save these games He's a homophobic SWAT team guy and then he saves everyone in the nightclub Oh, yeah, and like he could do press for the movie where he's like going up in Boston I didn't think gay people were humans and I would attack them on I know that you know, this is America. Yeah Have you ever seen him on inside the actors studio where he talks about that assault? No, no, it's ten years ago Yeah, and he sort of just laughs it off James Lipton. Oh James Lipton. Oh James lips is the king, dude He's so good and he talks about Assaulting that Vietnamese guy. He briefly mentions it. Yeah. Hey, just what does he say? I can't I mean That's where I learned about that that is like, you know, you had like a violent, you know a pastor or whatever and you watch it You're like what the should you be in jail? No, dude, wait, didn't you say that Kanye when he got in that car accident that like made him Oh, yeah, Kanye fell asleep. First of all, he was selfishly pursuing this production career. Yeah, and fucking fell asleep while driving because he was you know spending all his time in the studio and Drifts into oncoming traffic. He means selfishly though any creative pursuit is self He was working on it. He could just go have a regular job. He came from like an upper-middle-class background We're to the gap dude. He was a once-in-a-generation talent He would actually be robbing all of us by not pursuing a music career. All right. It's still a selfish pursuit So he would actually be making collages like the like lead Actually, yeah so he Fell asleep while driving like crosses in the oncoming traffic and fucking just You get sent a front-end collision with some cab driver and then was like, you know Lawyered up and made it so that he didn't have to pay the guy anything and like destroyed this guy's life in his business And then and then he that that accident and like through the wire Well, yeah, right. That was like the first single that you know off of the college chopper Yes, and the rest is history. Yeah, and it was because he destroyed that poor. I'm assuming Pakistani man Life, I don't know dude. I won't have I hit you Kanye And that man was I you should Sadiki's father You know, she has no idea it's sort of like a gangs of New York situation like a river I don't remember I don't remember like traffic.

It really was never the only shows. I really enjoyed that season 2 is a little bit better This season one, but I liked him both. Yeah, I thought they're both great I love Billy Bob, but I thought his kind of his plotline was a little too Jason Bourne for me Mm-hmm It was like he was just too good at karate and knowing which door to open and stuff like that But the second season I thought was was awesome. I liked him both. I didn't see fine That's Adam's film TV review guide TV guide. I don't watch any new I was just was watching RuPaul's Drag Race for the first time that shit is awesome, dude But I don't watch any like good TV except the Sopranos, which I've been watching. Well, you started watching fucking the Clay Clayton Dallas. What's it called? Oh, yeah Wait, I want to know more about this show. He's literally he's like a vine team Here's the setup so Cameron Dallas is one of these vine kids. He's actually originally an incident Was he was he in the vine apartment in LA? No, no, no, no He was part of this thing called MagCon which was put together by this older man that was like Obviously, he clearly feels like he missed the boat on being a vine boy Because he's in his like late 30s and he like you could have been a pretty boy when he was he was like He's like one of these guys. He's like a friend. He's their pimp. Yeah So this guy he started this thing MagCon where he like gets all these boys together and parades the boys in front of young girl He's like the the Lou Perlman the blimp Yeah, yeah, he's like sort of Lou Perlman meets Justin Bieber's dad. He's like a fucking monster energy drink Kind of like a real Federline vibe tatted up. Yeah, k-fed type dude. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, he's a pimp So he was pimping out the children The children got upset about it because they weren't getting enough money So they stopped doing the MagCon and they went with another guy that pimped them out even harder and like Exploited them even more. They went back to their old back to their original pimp and they said look we've always been your bottom dollar bitch You know, we want to we want to kiss the ring We want to turn that ass out, but then they fuck you night daddy By doing great vibes, I'll put that boy puts you on the stroll for you So yeah, then they go on like a European tour and it's basically they're exploits, you know what I mean It's just like Cameron Dallas got equity in this MagCon thing So now he's the boss of MagCon. Yeah, he's like this other guy Yeah, now I'm like a vine star and also a CEO. So like I got a hundred, you know, I have a lot of pressure in my life Yeah, and his mom is just like just oh, yeah, they show these kids backgrounds and it's like they don't you know They have kind of tragic backgrounds. It's like my mom was a drug addict and my dad was the guy that got addicted to drugs Yeah, so I have to live my great my green on green green paw my poop on peep-paw That was raised on pee pee and poo poo. It's it's it's chilling to learn the the pathos sits behind jokes about your mom not having They're heard the you know bagel bites ready They all look she was in recovery They all look like a sort of like feminized to they're all they're all beautiful sexy little boys for sure There's yeah, they have like full. They have gay mouth. They got a Well me and Cameron, you know, we're I mean that's that's always sort of been what what handsome is traditionally handsome Just a little bit of feminine feminization for sure for sure Elvis Elvis looked like a little bit I don't know if Elvis had gay mouth. He kind of Lips I don't know. I don't know yet. I'd have to take a look again. Yeah The best the best was the guys that were like considered handsome even though objectively not like Bogart or Jerry Orbach. Yeah This guy looks like absolute shit. Yeah, that's how strong the patriarchy used to be Some guys that women had to fucking think are handsome We got to get back to those levels So you talking like all the the the vine boys getting pimped out reminded me this is a good come-town film rec It's a closeout the year. Have you guys seen the documentary or heard of the documentary that came out this year called tickled? No, yeah, I've heard about I saw the trailer, but I was going to see it and then I heard it was like pretty disappointing Eat like no, I enjoyed it It was entertaining because like it's just the like the concept is that there is this basically one guy in Long Island who has been impersonating like women and people online for years Years basically blackmailing Teenage and boys and young men into tickling each other on videos. Hell. Yes Like and he is the the the mastermind of this entire like boy tickling network Hell, yeah, dude and rules it through but intimidation and blackmail It's done through Christianity sort of like as like kind of Is he blackmailing me gets like dick pics like well like well He blackmails them because he's like then threatens to like show all of these pictures and hours of a video It's like they're friends employers school The name makes it sound like it was like it should have been a Brennan Fraser movie that came out in Yeah, post I've got to find these boys Yeah, I got to find them It's pretty nuts though. I'm gonna check that out. I want to see that shit Speaking of be fridge, you know a movie I saw the other day Monkey bone but that bedazzled Is that the one he's the devil or whatever It's a good movie and he asked to be like a famous famous basketball star He has to be the most sensitive guy in the world, but he can't stop crying.

Yeah, she's really good in that shit You ever see I remember seeing tabloid pictures of her with like 35 nicorette patches on her body Yeah, yeah Cigarettes again. Hell. Yeah, dude. She probably does She she kind of looks evil which makes sense for being Satan. Is that a British thing? Maybe I'm looking evil. Yeah, now they will they either look like put big-time pussies or they look evil Look if they're up to something or they have like that fat like scone face Yeah, then boys up to something. Yeah. Yeah, there's they plot they scheme the British Sorry real quick This is the point in the movie where richly cook reveals to Freddie Prince, Jr. That her mother died and she makes collage art about it and she's gone back to being really unattractive Oh, she went back to that fucking ponytail if I see that bullshit one more time bitch Her collage art sucks though. Yeah, she sucks it on Every whatever paintings is why is she why is she being a piece of shit to him? She doesn't know she's not aware yet of his like scheme, you know, well, she's defense She can't let people in the background. She has a past. Come on, man. What's the past? died because of her art Now they were in the car together he's doing collage art in the back and like the mom was like just put that away Squirted paint on the She painted a picture of like a beautiful sunset on the inside of the windshield Oh, I'm a whore mom went to work and her mom fucking went right into a sample in the Kanye West So it wasn't his and then he spit it through the wire. Yeah. Yeah, dude. Yeah, it's like in Team America where they They're talking about the cast of cats rape That's why he hates actors by the magical mr. Misophilius that is such a funny So they're all Jewish Where's the fucking litter box piece of shit You stupid I'm trying to I'm trying to cough up a fucking hairball and you're down my ass Why don't you get a job you fucking cunt I was licking myself Licking my arms and my legs I was getting real clean And then what do what happens right as soon as I feel smooth I get this tickling in the back of my throat And I know I'm just gonna buff up a big one We do we really legitimately should go see cats and review it for the pond dude.

They're so pro. Yeah, every black and white movie. Everyone's smoking cigarettes. They look so fucking cool Yeah, and it's not like they didn't know prior to the 90s Yeah, yeah, but they honestly, I don't know up until like I was Like how did he become an actor? Fucking bloated pumpkin should be in a bowling league. He was in all this guy was in other shit Yeah, I know I'm daredevil. He's Kevin's isn't Power Rangers one of the bad guys one of the bullies isn't he Kevin from home or Kevin's older brother from home alone No, is that buzz is yeah, it might be buzz. I don't think so. He is the beta beta friend on daredevil. Mm-hmm the one who Daredevil fucks his bitch, right? No No, he doesn't but he could he could yeah, yeah, the girl wants to fuck daredevil But she doesn't and then that opens up the thing for him to fuck her, right? How fucking annoying would it be if you break up with a girl and then you see her on the street? And she's walking around with some fucking daredevil blind guy, and she's like oh He's like a great listener like you never listen to me You know he can't like you know and cuz he's blonde cuz he's fucking blonde He's a good listen cuz he's blind yeah his other senses including listening and then he just grabs her pussy.

We talk about your fan Bob Who sounds off in the comments and hates Bob Bob is the funniest. I love Bob so much I don't care what he thinks about me and the one where he's like I get two hours a week away from my demon. What? Yeah, Bob Bob. I'm son Bob. Yeah, he had Bob to be on Facebook when I did race wars And I thought it was like, you know, somebody doing an old guy character and I messaged him and I was like What's your deal? He's like just a race worse fan. I'm like, but are you really like an old-ass man or he's like, well, that's you know I guess relative. Oh Oh, yeah, look at this painting. Oh, she's a clown James Cameron ripped her off. That's the Navi right there That's avatar Came out and immediately fleshlight had an avatar pose They're making two or three more of those has there ever been a movie more flesh It's made more money with that with a little cultural impact is avatar. It's crazy No, I mean, it's insane. Does anyone like there's literally been no movie that's made that much money That's crazy. Yeah, it's the highest person. Yeah, and it's it's a garbage movie. No, it sucks dick But here's what I never thought you know the first one you go and see it and like what makes it such an immersive experience Is the 3d glasses? But for the second one, it's gonna be even better because it's gonna be in 3d It'll probably be in 4k, but you can also bring your avatar fleshlight That is five dimensions the fifth dimension is coming That's why fucking Stephen Hawking is obsessed Special relativity you know, but you remember in in avatar, right? Like the they like they when they hook when they fuck Yes, they look they had their like pony tails. They're pony tails like tentacles Like actually it's like yeah with one another exactly. It's the USB thing. That's interesting It's docking. However, they're docking. It's also in that movie When they like tame those like flying dinosaurs or whatever they port into them as well Oh, yeah, they're fucking dinosaurs. Yeah, it's a fuck dinosaurs. That's awesome Yeah, I realize that odd straight very strange. My favorite scene in that movie is when the mech pulls out a knife When the robot has a knife Guns the robot has a I mean weapon of last resort. Yeah, I guess I don't remember the public is in this movie Yeah, but Norman Norman Wilkerson had the funniest line about that movie goes What the fuck did he say he was like so why it's just like black people meets the cover of every yes album It does look really prod rock. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I can't believe yeah I thought I heard that that once it came out. He was gonna make like seven like he had this crazy Well, he designed a language. He had like a language make a language for and yet the font that you wait How funny is that that he basically? Commissioned a Linguistics professor like they're a guy that did screen printing Make me some shitty merch for my movie language print it up I bet you paid better than being a fucking professor. Whatever the fuck the he's uh, he's such a spirit go James Cameron You should watch do yourself a favor watch his best director acceptance speech for Titanic it's so funny. Yeah, when he asked for a moment of silence like a like a victims of the Titanic It was like during Bosnia. Yeah You know Titanic victims He's like and then he's like just not crushing the speech and it's going really bad that at the end He's like, oh, I guess there's a one thing left to say Dude, what's his name? Yeah, what's I directed shame and then 12 years asleep. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah Steve McQueen see McQueen. Yeah, he should have done that for 12 years of slay Yeah, there's only one thing left to say I'm 12 years asleep But uh, like okay, so he's asking for a moment of silence for the victims of the Titanic Yeah, yeah, the worst one of the worst boat accidents ever. Yeah He couldn't get away with that now because people would get mad at him for be like Hollywood Just only recognizing white victims. Yeah, he's literally only white people died Oh Then you can accuse all those people of stealing Cedric's bit About out. No black people. No black bands. You'll be playing as the ship goes down. Oh, yeah. Yeah, which is a great bit By the way, I think it's hilarious bit. What's the bit? They got the bands playing as the ease maybe it's Steve Harvey, but they're like what I think it's a drink Yeah, it's like what black band, you know is gonna be playing as the ship go down It's like, you know fucking cool in the gang. It's like pack up the shit. We're gonna Yeah, it was on Kings of comedy it's from the King's special. It's it's part of the bigger bit Which is about how like black people anytime they see people running they He also has that joke and that one about how Black people he's like the black people can't play hockey because it's a sport where they let you fight Dude Cedric's amazing Cedric, I think it's a very good comic. Yeah Before you guys came over we were watching the the Werner Herzog volcano documentary Yeah, and in it he talks about there is this French couple that like they all they did was film volcanoes But film them like extremely close up in a way. That's just stupid. Yeah, like they got amazing footage But it's just like it's just suicidal, right and he's like, you know, they filmed volcanoes for many years at great risk to their lives Of course, they would eventually killed by a volcano People so of course I had the thought that this would be a great bit for a black comic. Yeah Yeah You really did I guess like they just never get killed by nature And that's the trade-off. That's why we have to do it Is because you know what a tornado this turn is not gonna do it Oh, yeah, that's the one it's Hurricane Katrina. Yeah But what Hurricane Katrina would fuck what killed so many people wasn't actually the hurricane. It was the levees Yeah, it wasn't really the night. It was a man-made disaster Army Corvus. It was also the police afterwards Raping and beating their way through fucking New Orleans. Yeah shooting all those people Damn, um, that's when you could really you could really let loose as a cop. Yeah Imagine being a racist like a story about a black guy getting eaten by a killer whale. You'd be like that can't be right Yeah Yeah, you know Jamel used to have a bit about a canoeing and and what is that mountain climbing mountain climb?

        "transcript_text": " Fuck is this a family reunion? God damn, it's Brooklyn in the house! Alright, we're gonna set this up, fashion your seatbelts. This shit is definitely real. Now how many y'all like sex? We're gonna talk about sex. Now check this out just the other day, right? I went to the top floor of the World Trade Center, they got a bar up there. And I see this bitch got more butt than a box of new ports. Woo! Now this shit is definitely real. Hell yeah. Now how many y'all like sex? Check this out man, I be having sex sometimes. And this is what you do man, you know how it is man. You get the girl down there, a hoe, you bend over, you pull your dick out. What you do? You put your dick inside of the pussy. Pussy. 17 minute act out. God bless y'all, and remember let's get the guns off the streets people. Get the guns off the streets. And then Martin Lawrence comes back on stage. There are 157,000 murders in Chicago yesterday. I got caught in a deaf comedy jam. Why don't we call it a black hole? I want to sound... LASIST. I do not want to sound like a LASIST. It's a Chinese guy saying he doesn't want to sound racist. What's the guy's background? Give me a little bit of flavor. The Taiwanese. The guy I'm doing? It's a Jewish man doing a racist impression of a Chinese. Let's wait for it off. Yeah, yeah, no I see it. That's the thing about it, all these damn Jews are so racist. Every single one. I agree. I went to DC last week and met a lot of nice fellas. And they were saying a lot of the same things about Jews. I've been saying since I went to camp. The black Israelites. They're the original Jews. That's quite a show by the way. I love those guys. Just setting up shop and watching them. So somebody, I had kind of a legal issue going on this week. So I didn't have time to respond to them. Also, just a heads up, I'm getting a lot of notifications for Facebook messages. If you're messaging me and I'm not responding, I am banned from Facebook. I can't respond to you. I have no, I can see the messages, but I can't respond. So I'm not ignoring you. I know a lot of people are probably... People sliding your DMs trying to suck you off on Facebook? Yeah, I don't know. I think, you know, I mean, if it's, I don't want to say Reddit guys, but basically anyone in any online community is fickle. So you don't respond to them for two days and they're like, actually you know what, fuck this guy. So I'm not ignoring you, I just can't, I can't respond to anything. This is what fuck you pieces of shit. Yeah. I'm the bad boy, dude. They're going to be fickle. I'm the bad boy of the group. I'm like the administrator. I'm like the chief of medicine here. I don't know what that means. I'm house. Who's the guy that runs the hospital? You're the... You're the... You're the sexy Jewish bitch with the big nose. The doctor. So what's the administrator? It's like the... You're the bitch with the big nose on house. I'm house. No one watches house. Adam is a... No one knows what the fuck you're talking about. Adam is a... I don't know what the gay character is. This is a diagnosis murder household. You're right, I'm sorry. So basically... But I am house. I'm a... I'm fucking dick van dyke. Okay. You're Scott Bayo who has written off the show. Yeah, Belly. Adam is the guy that replaced Scott Bayo. Yeah, yeah. Now, but Scott Bayo was so much better than the guy that replaced him. Yeah, and then he went on to do some bullshit show where he's like a... He's like a doctor that's also a poet, I think. Who's Scott Bayo? Scott Bayo. That's why he left out against his murderers to do some other shitty daytime. To switch it up. To switch up the doctor. He was the dumb doctor he was. Yeah, I forget. You know, I made... I used to run... I think it's still on Twitter. If you go to twitter.com slash PAX television. I had like a Twitter parody account. Back when I was struggling to find content that hit, I had... Where I would just pitch PAX TV shows. So I know that there was one Scott Bayo joke on there. And now I can't remember the difference between the Scott Bayo joke show I came up with. Where he's a doctor that's also a hobbyist beekeeper that moves to the big city and needs to use his bees to, you know, cope with the medicine life in the big city. The best idea I had on that one was a show called Checking Engine. Hello. And Branscom Richmond plays a Navajo man that uses stereotypes to solve crimes. Branscom Richmond, by the way, plays Billy Six Gun on the show Renegade. Oh, yeah. Starting Lorenzo Lamas. Yo, that was a good show. That show is badass, dude. I'm trying to watch some Renegade. I liked Lorenzo Lamas. He was... I mean, I'm a fan of a lot of 90s action guys. You know, your Lamas's, your Lundgren's, you know... You would put Lamas in the same category as Lundgren? No, no, Lamas was a TV guy. Lundgren was a movie guy. I forget the guy who played Adrian on the Highlander TV show. Oh, yeah. He was great. Yeah. And, uh, Gabrielle or something? Uh, Union. Gabrielle Union. Gabrielle Union. She fucks Dwayne Wade. Dwayne Wade? Well, no. Hold on. There was a point. Oh, yeah. Also, there was a kid... Dwayne Wade? There was some guy... There was some guy who's like a university. He goes to some school and he fucking emailed me questions. But then I had this, like, legal thing. Oh, fuck. Oh, yeah, the guy. Yeah, he wants to do his school report on us. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it was like... Basically, I guess, you know, maybe I shouldn't just blow up. I guess I could respond to them on the podcast. That's easier than typing. What is it? University of Montana. Well, he was like, yeah, I guess I could pull him out. He was like, you know, are you worried that people are going to think you're a bigot? And, uh, it's like, you know, I am, I guess, right? No. By pretty... By, you know, the looser modern definition. I don't think anyone would be cool. I don't think you are. I don't think everybody... Substantively, you're bigoted. I think that you're actually... I run a barely ironic podcast. I say racist shit all the time, and I get money from actual Nazis to do it. So, I mean, if I'm not... I don't know for sure that they're Nazis. If I'm not a bigot, then Steve Bannon isn't a bigot. No, I do. We're by the same definition. You're right. We aren't as funny as Breitbart. That is true. Those are some fucking good asses. Steve Bannon made his money off of the Jewish sitcom, Seinfeld. Yeah, that's true. And we are making our money off of the Nazis, so we're the opposite. Why would some shitty article that was like, he drew inspiration from... Who's the filmmaker that made Birth of a Nation? Uh, oh, uh, fucking the... Oh, no, not Birth of a Nation. Shrine for the Will. Uh, Lanny Riefenstahl. Yeah, yeah. They're like... They show in like every film class. Yeah, she's a genius. Yeah, to be like, oh, he drew inspiration from a Nazi propaganda. And so was the guy who made Birth of a Nation. He's like a filmmaker. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, what's his fucking name? Not DeMille. She should be DeMille. Yeah, it wasn't DeMille. We're idiots. This is the whole fucking job. First of all... I don't know. It's Michael Bay. I think anything... You know, I used to say... I used to say... I used to say, any movie that's a silent film, it's bullshit. Not worth watching. Hell yeah. It's too antiquated, and I'm right about that. Yeah, that's right. No, there's one good one. There's one good one. Is there one with titties? I don't care what you're going to say. You couldn't even have titties back then. There's one. Yes, you could. In the pre-code Hollywood, you could have titties. Really? Yeah, they were much slottier back then. Oh, hell yeah. And women played bigger roles, and then after they introduced all the code. Oh, they dumb shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's like 30s. You could even kiss. And 1938 is when... In 1938 is when... A window outside. But no, I used to say... It was like fuck off screen. No silent movies are worth watching. And then I updated it. Now it's no movies without color. A couple years ago. That's fine. Yeah, so... It might be one or two. Now it's... If it doesn't have CGI in it, it's bad. Yeah, seriously. If there's no turtles. Because the technology's gotten good enough now. Yeah. You know, I'm not talking about Scorpion King, you know, Mummy 3. Yeah, that shit's fine. I'm saying, you know, I want it... Avatar is the only good movie. Avatar is the only... Not even a good movie. Because, you know, it's not a good movie, but it's the only movie worth watching anymore. Wasn't he gonna come out with like 12 avatars? I will go to the theater unless it's for something like that. You guys should know this. I'm shopping around for a 4K television. Basically what that is, is it's four 1080p televisions combined into one TV. So that level of resolution means that's four different ways that I'm better than you. Yeah. And when I watch a movie, I'm experiencing it to a degree that you'll never experience. There are no Steven Seagal movies in 4K. Yeah. We all just gotta check for $1,000 each. Yeah, we're rich, bitch. I'm buying a 700 dollar blender. I'm fucking making soups in that, bitch. Because that's how hot they get. Stop actually copied my idea to get the blender. Guess who's gonna buy first, bitch? I got a meaning. It's my idea. I got a new TV, guys. Did you? Yeah, it's a 3K TV. And it only shows racist...nice. Oh yeah, okay. That was pretty good, man. That's a 3K TV. That was really good, Adam. You were sitting on that when we were talking about 4K. Then we started talking about what we're gonna buy with the checks. I'm sorry. I couldn't get in there. And you thought this 3K joke is so good, I thought it would save it for after a whole another topic has been introduced. Well, it was fast. It was fast-moving. And it was just one topic. Maybe if you were feeling the flow of the conversation, instead of being pleased with yourself because it's a 3K joke. I just thought that if I brought back the 3K joke, that it would be a funny enough joke to disrupt. So what else are you gonna buy with these things? Yeah, when I was a kid, I thought...I get anxiety when people bring up the clan because as a kid I thought it was Clu-Clock's clan. Yeah, yeah, me too. What do you mean? Hold on. And so I said that to somebody one time and they laughed at me in fourth grade for saying Clu-Clock's clan. And then that's why...so whenever the clan comes up, I get nervous. It's not Clu. It's Koo. It's Koo. And it's because I fucked it up one time. I used to think it was like chickens. So the thing that makes you nervous about the KKK is the pronunciation. Yeah. It's not that they're existence and you're just like... Yeah, no. That's my privilege is that I get nervous. I'm embarrassed about the conversation. I'm pronouncing it wrong, not them like fucking doing hate crimes to your family. Well, that doesn't affect me. Well, no, it does affect you apparently. How so? Nick can't handle antisemitism. I thought it was Clu-Clock's as well. Oh, yeah. I had to get off Twitter. Nick quit Twitter because of all the antisemitism. And you know what? I support you as an ally. You know? He's also wearing a yellow star in solidarity with me for the month. And I think that's great. I really, I support you. Well, we do make you wear a yellow star. Well, I have to. In true punk rock tradition, I got a giant swastika tattooed on my chest. Yeah. And a little arrow underneath it that says bad. No, get out of here, swastika underneath. So people know. Fuck, dude. That's awesome. Yeah. People know that I'm against the swastika. That's fucking tight. Yeah. It's cool. It's anti-fascism. I like that. I like that. Anti-fascist. Dude, anti-fascism is where it's at. I was putting pins on my leather jacket. Oh, dude, yeah. Also. Did you guys see that pin that was like $10,000? Like Swarovski crystals. It was a safety pin. So funny. I just mean I like putting like Gigi Allen pins, you know? Like I'm a cool guy. I love Gigi Allen. That's real music, man. Real music is when you just get up there and you take a dump on the stage. Have you seen the documentary? And then you show everyone your dick and you smear the shit all over your face. And you talk about fucking kids. And you eat the poo. And then you eat the shit. You eat the poo poo. And that's like, you know, that's the kind of shit you miss out on with your fucking MP3s and your CDs, you know. That's like real vinyl. Right. Who is visceral? It's immediate. You know, you're like seeing the man poop on stage. Smelling the poop on stage. You know, you're seeing him eat it. It's something more, it's punk rock, you know. And there's always some posers. And there's always some posers wearing the shit from that show to the show. Oh, yeah. The older shit. You gotta wear last year's shit he left off. He went to the merch show. You can't wear shit from the same guy who just walked in. He went to the merch table, bought a t-shirt. You gotta have 311's shit. You gotta have a big turd. Not even the same genre of music. Who the fuck went to a G.G. Allen concert? You saw that documentary. I found out what that was like and was like, hell yes. That's what I want to fucking... Some guy screaming is gonna smell horrible. The guy that might rape my mouth while I'm fucking... It's also like you can get that for free in New York City everywhere. Yeah, just take the train. That's what the train is. The only people I knew that liked G.G. Allen were just like fucking try hard 13 year olds, right? There's not still this. Were there any grown men at those shows? Were there grown people? No, it's music for 11 year old. To say that you're cool. To have zero imagination. That are mad that their dads haven't come back. Yeah. That's why I'm glad I never liked Bacowski. There's a whole period where people are getting into Bacowski and I'm like, you realize this is trash, right? It's garbage. This is really bad. Jake liked Bacowski. Well, Jake is a man of many tastes. Well, no, it's one taste. You like Bacowski? Yeah. What do you have to say about that, Adam? I think it's cool if he's into that, but I think I don't... I agree with Nick's take, because Nick is my boss. Nick ain't my boss. Dude, I'm a fucking independent contractor. I'll do whatever the fuck I want. Yeah, you guys are independent contractors. I'm not necessarily your boss. No, you're my boss, chief. That means if one of you individually gets sued for something that happens on the show, I don't have to help you out. Well, if I get... If I get... One of the odds is someone gets sued for something on the show and it's not you. If I get injured when I get sued, I've never said anything bad about anybody. If I get injured on the show, which I'm planning on... I said true things. What's Jake gonna sue me for saying you like Bacowski? It's fucking true. I'm gonna talk about that. If I get injured on the show, I'm gonna file for... Yeah, Jake doesn't even... We do workman's comp? No. That's... You don't understand. No, you... Nick, you have to do it if I get hurt. I'm gonna fucking... Stop it! Ow! Adam's bitch! Ow! Stop! Ow! That's a work-related... Yeah, what if I hit him? The soon you be accountable? One part of independent contract, if you don't understand it. If you're employees, yes, actually, because of a respondent superior. Well, let me be vice president. Which means that anything that happens, even something like that, in the course of normal day-to-day business, I would be responsible for it. Now, after that, I could, you know, go and sue you. I could also sue him because you colluded to make it happen. Was it collusion? Yeah, you posed it as a hypothetical. First of all, I have... Already, I have nine lawyers. And everything I say, yeah. Everything I say, they go lobby and make it into law. Oh, wow. Holy shit. I don't know that. That's fucked up. That's what I'm talking about. That's juice. That's real juice. That's power. Yeah, that's power. So we're gonna become Wall Street guys. We have been wearing suspenders ever since we got these $1,000 checks today. Yeah, dude, I'm in hair club for men now. I'm wearing suspenders attached to my oversized basketball. Yeah, that is such a bad look. I have a French cuff shirt, you know, stripy. You do have tie-dye socks, though, bitch. Don't tell the listener. That's some straight Jewish summer camp socks right there, my dude. Oh, hell yeah. These socks will listen to fish, dude. Guster. So what's going on this week? I guess, you know... Thanksgiving, bitch. Yeah, Thanksgiving. I can't wait. I'm gonna give a fuck. In honor of Thanksgiving, we have a couple of fun little facts, maybe stuff you didn't know about Thanksgiving. We've been prepping this bit, so I think it's ready to go. Yeah. It's been in the oven. It's been roasting. Yeah, like a turkey. Like a turkey, yeah. Like a big turkey. That's pretty good. That's pretty funny. Adam, do you want to start? I have one, hold on. That doesn't pick up ever. Why? He does that every episode where he farts at the fucking mic. It just doesn't register. The fart gets trapped in the wind guard. Dude, I bet it registers, honestly. It doesn't. I'm the guy that fucking listens to the man. Every once in a while, one of them goes through. No. That wasn't a good one, but anyway. They're never good. Also, you should do better farts. I'm trying, man. I have not been eating that bad, by the way, so... Yeah, you do very small, lame, like French girl type farts. I've been trying to eat better. That's why. You're a fraud. You should do some thunderous kind of a wet... I've been wearing a fat suit. I'm sexy as shit, actually. You're dead sexy. Dude, I'm so fat. I wish fat suits would come back. Hopefully in the Trump administration. Absolutely. That's all comedy. Honestly, you know, people are like, oh, this is going to be good for comedy. It's like, yeah, it's going to be good for comedy if comedy goes back to being racist. Because that's good comedy. You know, I mean, seriously. People are like, oh, wow, adventure time. It's actually got a lot of jokes for adults. No, it's for babies. You know what had a lot of jokes for adults? Fucking Daffy Duck when he was using the N-word. Those are jokes for adults. We're going to talk about children's entertainment. It's meant for a grown man. How about Porky the Pig calling somebody a Jap and shoving bamboo under his fingernails? That's a joke for an adult. You're dead, Jap. Those are good adult-oriented children's cartoons. Yeah. The N-word. The N-word. The 7 Dwarfs. That is. You expect a child to understand the jokes printed on the back of that murder-incorporated truck? Well, it's very nuanced and adult. Oh, fuck, the 7 Dwarfs. That shit is so terrible. The prince's teeth are made out of gold, and they've got, like, dice markings on them. Well, gold, that's expensive. Yeah, children don't understand that. It's expensive, too. They don't know about any of that stuff. Yeah, that's true. Well, children are fucking stupid as shit. Yeah. You're right. I still think we should make that cool sultan sketch. That would be a good sketch. With all this money? I had another idea for a fucking sketch the other day. Oh, yeah. It's like a dog fight, you know? I love that. So it's like a warehouse. We could use my dog. Real tough urban setting. Yeah, very urban setting. And all these dudes are like, yeah, and then we'll write the N-word into it. There'll be a lot of guys saying, yeah, you know. Like, I'm gonna say my man right now, but you know what I mean. It's like, yeah, my man, let me get, you know, setting up the dog fight. They got the dogs in the pit, and they're like, yeah, you ready to do this shit, my man? You ready to do this shit? You know, so this is like the U-Pan 20 version of the sketch. You know, like, so they got the dogs there, and there's a guy with a boom box, and he hits play on the boom box. Yeah. And you know, the audio is like, obviously coming from the boom box. It's not, you know, overlaid the shot. And then out of the boom box, they're all listening to like, in the arms of the angel. That's their favorite shit at the dog fight. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the song they listen to. The one from the commercial. They're like, yeah, yeah, that's my shit, my man. Yeah, my man. My man. My man. Yeah. That's the sketch idea. Do you think Tarantino, like, he's like at his keyboard? My man, please. Tarantino is like, my man's running around. Oh, guys, stop it. So to answer your question, yes, the show is bigoted. It is ironic, but you know, what does it matter? Because it's a slippery slope, irony. Look, you know, look, that's why I had to leave Twitter. VanCult is going to openly defend the American Nazi party. Yeah, that's tough. There's no room for guys like me anymore. At least online, relegated to the world of podcasts where there's still a little bit of nuance left. Yeah. This is nuance. This is nuance, dude. That's what I was thinking. I would break my heart if my daughter ever brought up my man home. Shut up. Do you think there's a guy out there that's like, you know, a guy that's like, I don't care if you're gay, you're my son, I love you, but don't you ever bring a Mexican man to me? Yes, for sure. I think so. You can be gay, in fact, I'm glad you're gay. Yeah. The Bible actually says it's okay. Yeah. People read it wrong. It's like that for gay Jews, where they're like, where they're like, you know, as long as you bring hope into the Jew. Which book actually says that it's wrong to be gay? Leviticus? Yeah, it's the same one where it's like you can't wear, you can't fucking eat shellfish. It was my bar mitzvah portion, actually. Oh yeah? You just chose it? No, that was just around my birthday. Just want to send you a message there. Just in case. You have to make sure he's not a... They're a little suspicious. I'd say like, read it like this. Now, Edam, read this very carefully. My dad crocodile doesn't need it. No. Goodbye, mate. I'm from South Africa. Oh, Edam's gay dad. Blumen Onion, Governor, Cheerio, Tip Top. Put another boffit on the lorry. I'm gonna suck off a kangaroo, I am. That's not how it's South African sound. I can do a South African accent if you want. No, Edam's gay. Edam, my son is gay. We're gonna do our version of the South African accent. We don't want to hear your version. I'll have a gay son named Edam. He's gay. Oh, he's gay because I ate too many crumpets while I was pregnant. Well, I was an organism mom. Inside Africa, the man gets pregnant because he's got a pouch. Like a fucking roux. I can show you guys the South African accent if you want. And then he sucks it. You know what he does is he puts a kangaroo's tail up his ass, and then a kangaroo nods at him. And he sucks off a wallaby? Yeah, fucking country, dude. You know, it's okay for us to say that because South Africa is racist. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's us doing freedom fighting. There's a story my dad used to- Fucking white ass. Down with fucking- White ass South Africa. There's a story my dad used to tell me when I was a kid. Is this shit called apartheid? Yeah. Down with that shit. There's a story my dad used to tell me when I was a kid. And was he like, eat him? He sat me down and he said, There was a lion. And a great warrior. Great. That's pretty good. Yeah. Scottish. That's pretty good. Scottish accent. Unlike our spot on South African accents. Wait, what were we talking about before we started? Thanksgiving irony? No, oh yeah. Getting head. South Africa's pretty stupid. It's a beautiful country. They've been making so many shitty movies. Leasing and- Is that guy? District 9. It's just that one guy. Chappy. Chappy's kind of tight. No, it's not. It's not bad. I watched it. I watched it wrong. It's not bad. It's bad. District 9 was pretty good. District 9 wasn't that good. And people thought it was good. And then he's like, what if I made an even shittier movie? No, he's like, what if- He's like, okay. First of all, we're going to have robots. Right? Okay. No, there's not. The middle one is at least you. The robots. The robots. Represent the blicks. The blicks. And then everyone else represents the whites. And it's really about apartheid. It's not- It's like, yeah. It's like- Is that Chappy? Is that District 9? No, that's what District 9 is. That's what Elysium is. Elysium is the one where- It's all about apartheid. Not Damon. Not Damon, who like- He has some bullshit accent or he speaks Spanish or something. He doesn't speak Spanish or he's the one guy raising the barrio. Yeah, there's like a barrio. There's a bunch of fucking Spanish people. The movie sucks, dude. Elysium sucks. Chappy sucks. Okay. Well, sorry, dude. It's not my fault. I don't know that guy, Neil Blumconf. I'm mad because we were talking about something. Then we got sidetracked. Thanksgiving, irony, inculter, Nazis. Oh, yeah. The inculter thing. Yeah, that's fucked up, dude. Yeah, that is fucking weird. She's just outright defending Nazis now. I'm shocked. I am. I would think she would be that dumb. I actually kind of am. You know? She's- It's presumably scary that Nazis are just like- She's just a troll, right? Things that pundit- People say that all the time. Like, whenever they're confronted with somebody that, you know, just has these ridiculous beliefs, they go, oh, they're a troll, which is the case with maybe two or three people. She knows how to piss people off, though. Sure, but she believes it. Oh, sure. If their beliefs just pissed people off, why wouldn't she anyways? There are plenty of bigoted idiots that don't know how to piss off a ton of people, and she is not one of them. I don't understand the motivation behind saying, oh, well, they're just a troll or whatever. I think that's like- I'm not saying that- I'm not saying that as an excuse. I'm not saying that she- But there is this narrative of these people that just have regular beliefs, but put on this fucking- People think that about- Bill O'Reilly. Black, Bill O'Reilly, all these types of motherfuckers. And I guess I sort of did think that about Ann Coulter. Well, Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly makes more sense, because they're like former radio guys. Right, right, right. Glenn Beck, more so. Bill O'Reilly was like, he's got that little hat and shit now. He's got the little hat and that scarf. Oh, yeah, he looks terrible in that picture. He looks so funny. Oh, yeah. Now he's black lives matter. Wild Wild West. Yeah. Yeah. Wild Wild Kanye West. Yeah, yeah. He's like Westworld now. Yeah. It looks like he goes to get his dick sucked by fucking barmaid's in Westworld. Yeah. Well, he goes to Westworld to suck Thomas Jefferson's dick. I fucking watched one episode of Westworld when I was high, and the point of that thing, these people pay money to have these like fantasy experiences. Yeah. And then just like a lot of them are just rape. Yeah, and murder. They're just rapes people. What the fuck is that? I don't know why it has to be the Wild West. Why would rape be like a destination thing? It's not rape, but they're having sex with prostitutes in the Wild West. No, that guy like rapes people. But it's also like there's no way in the future in the world he wouldn't just have prostitutes. Right, right, right. Like I don't understand why you would go with your family to the Wild West, and you'd be like, honey, you and the boys have fun. I'm going to have sex with this extremely realistic robot that has its own personality. It needs to be wiped at night. I'm like, no, it's not cheating. Because, you know. It's like if you're going to rape dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. That's essentially what this is. That's what happens. That's crazy. Why would you... That's the fucking... It's because human beings actually have a dark nature. Oh man. That's how you know the show is smart. That's pretty good, man. It's kind of like Black Mirror. It's for smart people. I actively hate Westworld, but I've for some reason... I watched three episodes of it. I didn't want to watch it. I watched ten minutes of the first episode and I was like, yeah, this is a bad show. And I've kind of been... It just costs so much money that I feel like I have to watch it. I don't know why. It's stupid. I don't know why. I was watching Sopranos again. I love it. I'm back in. I had never technically finished the Sopranos. I know. You're a fucking idiot, dude. I know. I'm plugging away, dude. That's what I'm doing over Thanksgiving. I'm just fucking eating a steak by myself. And... And watching Sopranos. Guys, so Thanksgiving facts. That's what I was trying to say. Oh yeah! Well, I didn't sidetrack us on that one. That was someone else. No, I said, Adam, what's your Thanksgiving fact? And then, stop saying something. That was our homework for this week. We're rich now. We have to prepare for this podcast. Absolutely. We have to start writing bits in advance like all the other good podcasts do. You think Mark Marin just lets his show happen? He's like, nah, how am I going to act like a cunt this week? He writes all that. This is a character I'm doing. He's actually a really nice guy. Yeah. But that's his character. He's an angel. So Thanksgiving is basically the holiday. And he hates going to the fucking post office. Where Christopher Columbus met with the Indians. That's right. Known as Italian-American Christopher Columbus. Right. And he said, we're going to have lunch. We're going to have a big old fucking meal. Yeah. And then that's how... They had macaroni. They had gravy. That's how we're going to make peace. They had a lot of gravy. Yeah. They had some gravy. Very good gravy. Some macaroni. And then what happened was, because of his flashy style, his flashy but very accessible style. Italian style. Because he wanted to fuck him. And the chief got mad. What are squaws? That's a type of Indian? I think that's a woman. I think it's like a group of friends. I thought that was like a woman Indian. Squaw. Squaw. Squawgulls. Squawgulls. Squawgulls. And then the Indians got mad and tried to fight him. Well, what are the types of Indians? And then he had to have a genocide. It's Apache, Dothead. Savage. Savage. Dot. Jesus. Muslim. Sikh. Sikh. Yeah. Turban style. Sikh is actually, that's like the SS. If Muslims are Nazis. If Muslims are Germans. Then Sikhs are like the SS. Yeah, yeah. Like the Schittstaffel of... Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why people are like, oh, these Sikhs are being attacked after 9-11. Yeah, yeah. They had too much pride to do 9-11. They weren't responsible for it because they thought they were too good for it. Yeah, it's a cowardly way to die. Yeah, yeah, yeah. If the Sikhs could have found a way to chop down the towers, I'm sure they would have. And that justifies it in my mind. Guys, Nick is just a troll. Now he believes all this stuff. You know what, and I probably brought it up before, but where the fuck is... What happened to those Turbans that had the jewel and the feather? I know. That was tight. Yeah, I could fix Muslim-American relations with the general public in fucking 20 minutes. If you just let me sit these people down and just say to them, once and for all, bring back the jewel feather turban. Wear it. The Muslims don't wear it. I don't think they have turban. We'll pay for it. I don't care. Start wearing them. That's what people want. They do want that. You make a deal with the police, you put a camera in the jewel. One gold tooth? Yep. Yeah, the NSA will pay for the cameras. The Muslims become the police bodycams. They get the cool. Everyone thinks they're Aladdin's dad in law. Jasmine's dad. The good guy. Because right now I'm telling you, you're Jafar. He had a turban with a thing too. He did not have a jewel and a feather. I think he did. I think he had a red jewel. No. He was also kind of fruity. That's true. But did he want to fuck Jasmine? All the bad guys were gay. But Jafar was sort of an Omar Mateen character. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. If you think about it. Yeah, yeah. He was like a closeted radical. Omar sucks pee. He used to just go to the gay clubs and be like, I hate it here. I hate it. Everyone's so happy. I don't want to have sex with anybody here. That's my Jafar. Pretty good. Not bad. Not bad, right? Yago, let me suck your parrot cock. They're supposed to be Muslim in Aladdin, right? I don't know. They're supposed to be Arabian. Arabian, yeah. But didn't Jafar want to fuck Jasmine? Yeah. No, he only wanted to marry Jasmine so he could have a descendancy. Yeah. But didn't he have like a weird creepy wanting to fuck her, a fucking eater? That's not creepy. She was hot. She was gay. She was the hottest girl. For sure. Well, yeah, for sure. Out of any Disney girl. She was fired, dude. And she was hot as shit. She had ass too. She had ass too. I'm actually only attracted to the POC Disney princesses. In case anyone's listening and keeping score in terms of the things I've said. Chuck, a big fat, that's like a hundred points in the Good Guy category. Yeah. In real life, just white women. I actually only wanted to fuck Sebastian, the Jamaican lobster. I wanted to have... That's huge, man. That's transpecies. That's black. I want to fuck him. I want to use his Pinterest on my balls. Put his claw in my ass. Put his tail in your ass while he pinches your balls. The Jamaican. I want to fuck Mulan when she's dressed as a man. I want to put the tea kettle. I want to fuck the tea kettle. Warm up that. I want the candle in my ass. That French candle in my ass. What's he doing? What's going on in here? That has to be the gayest word. Candelabra? That's the gayest word. There's no way. There's a Liberace documentary. Yeah, for sure. That wasn't bad. Scott. That candle definitely went in people's asses. That guy was definitely a gay candle. Gaston was gay. Gaston was hella gay. You think Gaston was the only straight character in The Indies? What are you talking about? The Beast was gay? We were all gay except Gaston. Gaston was the only gay that was straight. Gaston's assistant? LaFou? LaFou. Holy shit. I wanted to suck off Gaston so bad. What if we're... My favorite thing about Beauty and the Beast is that like, you know, first of all, Belle is a piece of shit. That character sucks. She's just like the only person in town that knows how to read and she's like, I'm better than everyone here. Yeah. Fuck, her dad works hard. Like, you know, he's got a job making shit. Sure, the shit he makes sucks. But she's like, no, I'm just going to read all of this. These men just did suck dick. Yeah, she fucking didn't do shit. She sucked. And then everyone in the town is just like, you know, like no one's like, didn't we have a prince at one point? Yeah. Wasn't there some kind of government here that like oversaw everything? The prince has just been missing for years. There's a mansion in the woods that no one checks in on. I think we talked about this. Yeah, we might have. But who else would you fuck though? Sleeping Beauty? Jasmine, dude, she's so far. Yeah, Jasmine is the hottest one. She's so far. She had to ass. Were there any women dwarves? Why weren't there any women dwarves? On what? In Sleeping Beauty and the Beast. No. That's the only man. The other one. No, they all, they all, there were seven dwarves. I love that. Oh, Maleficent probably, she was fucked. I love going to DeviantArt accounts where the seven dwarves are doing gang gang. Oh, the best shit on DeviantArt. Yeah, that shit is great. The best shit on DeviantArt. They're all just fucking with their little but thick ass midget dicks. The best shit on DeviantArt is Train Sonas. It's autistic people that draw themselves as trains. Oh, yeah. So they have like, you know, so it'll be like a top. Hell, yes. It'll be like a colored pencil drawing of like a Thomas the Tank engine character. But then it'll have those like, those shitty rectangular lens crafters glasses on the train. Just no emotion on the train's face. Like this is my Train Sona, Eric. Train Sona. Yeah. Stupid names person. But it's a train, yeah. Damn, that's some good shit. Oh, Arthur, she got divorced. Oh, that's funny. She left him? Yeah. What did he look good? I mean, better than Arthur should be able to do. Yeah, well, that's true. Arthur should really only fuck people that look identical to Arthur. There's no lateral shift. There's no lateral shift in looking like that. You know, you can't be like, oh, well, his wife's ugly, but in a different way. Like that's peak ugly is Arthur. Yeah, that is true. You want to hear? Arthur looks like the brain bug from the end of Starship Troop. Oh, fuck dude. My cousin, this is funny kind of racist thing. My cousin, well, we don't want to hear it, man, is dating a Chinese guy and she did it. So one chat family. She did Snapchat face swap with his grandparents. Like these two little Chinese people. And they look exactly the same as without the face swap. Old Asian people. It's like, yeah. Completely. It's really cute. You think that's why communism worked in that country is because they all look exactly the same? Yeah, you just replace one. One goes out. Yeah. Yeah, but I mean, because even the Chinese people, they have to come on. They have to be like, come on. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you know, I mean, there's like with white people, they all came from like, at some point, all extremely racist countries that insisted on inbreeding for, you know, thousands of years. So that's what you do have some kind of. So we're all cocker spaniels. Yeah, exactly. There's different like breeds of white people, but with China, it's like, I mean, come on. There's like four people that live there. No. It's like the Sims, dude. Dude. It's like China is an entire country built on like create a wrestler presets. There's one guy that's like an asshole with like tie dye sweatpants and a parrot on his head. I think they juggalo makeup. I think they all look really different. I think there's at least 12 types. There's like the Yao Ming. There's the Jackie Chan. There's sexy bitches. There's different flavors of sexy bitches, you know, the ones with big titties. The ones with their tall, but trim, so that's like two people right there. Thoughts? You know, I think that probably if you live in China, it's probably easier to differentiate between different people that you live with. I don't know, guys. If we have any Chinese nationalists that listen to the show, just call in. Go ahead and call in. Let us know whether or not. And I know this is like definitely an extremely stale inquiry, probably dating back 30 years, but it hasn't been resolved. We're doing like a David Brenner bit right now. Have you ever watched David Brenner? I just have no answer. Oh, I'm getting a call right now. This better be good, dude. This better be a fucking hilarious thing you have to say if you're going to do a phone act out. What is it? They hung up. Who hung up? Oh, they hung up? The Chinese national that was calling me. All right. Thanksgiving facts. So the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria. Yeah. Yes. Do you know it's originally the Nina, the penis in the Santa Maria? I do now. I saved it. Hell yeah, dude. It was Nina, Latina, Rita, Shalandra, Freakly. It was a Peetie Pablo. There was a fourth ship called Freakly. Peetie Pablo was the original settler of Catan. He came over from Europe for spices. How fucking funny is that that like all of the problems as far as racism goes. Because the food was too bland. Colonialism, yeah, is because somebody was like, I'm trying to put some hot sauce on. Oh, my damn bread. That's how Europeans actually talk back in the day. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I learned this from the black Israelites. Medieval Europe, all black men. It was. Just the kings. Yeah. Everyone else was white. All the subjects were white. And the kings and queens. Dude, I fucking love them so much. I know. I wish I could participate. I would fucking love to be a part of that. Jezeb and their stupid costumes. I love it. Just screaming at people, dude. Yeah, King Arthur, oh, he was black. King Arthur was black. Merlin was black. Merlin was black. Yeah. Like, yeah, none of those people were real. They weren't to take them away from us. You know how you spell Merlin? M-A-R-Y-L-A-N-D, yeah. Nice to meet you, boys. God. Yeah, very nice, very nice. Balmer Merlin. Yeah, what do you guys do for Thanksgiving? I was going to roll with you, but I just found out that you're not going home until Friday. Yeah. So what the fuck is that? But Thanksgiving is tomorrow. Yeah, but... So you're not going... What the fuck is the point of going back on Friday? Well, some of my family's not even going to be there until Friday. So I just... You're having Greek Thanksgiving? No, we don't really give a fuck about that. Greek people don't really care about Thanksgiving. So I'm just going to go... This is why Ann Coulter's right. That's why GC go back. I'm going Friday. Greek people don't care about Thanksgiving. That's why we need to kick them out. This isn't a women's shelter. It's a country. Yep. I went to Starbucks today and had them write Thanksgiving on my cup. Yeah. Yeah. This is pretending to have a problem with it. You're a gun in the selfie video you're taking. Yeah. I want you to watch this, YouTube. I'm going into Starbucks now, and I'm having them write Kwanzaa Christmas, Monica, Thanksgiving, Arbor Day, every holiday I can on the cup. If they run out of space, I am discharging my weapon. I'm going to fucking kill the ethnic barista that's paid too much money. How is that? That's like the last battleground of America. Why are they so mad at Starbucks? It's fucking lattes. I'll tell you why, because if you drive cross-country, you go to some of these shitty ass towns in the middle of nowhere. The only thing they have is a Starbucks. That's like the most cosmopolitan place they have. Yeah, dude. That is New York Liberalism. That's the beacon of liberalism. If you walk in there, it's like a fucking Woody Allen movie to these people. Yeah, I love that. Every year, it's fucking something. They were just writing Trump. That shit is so good. What a fucking protest. They won't write Trump on my book. I'm going to give these motherfuckers $12. My name is Swastika. You've got to write it on there. That's the rule. Yeah, like that's even a law or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the fucking Constitution. They're the same people that insist on misgendering people. Yeah. They're like, I am fucking saying Bruce. They're like, they wrote my name wrong on the cup. On my double shot, red-eyed, flat white, that I had to have mine special. And they wouldn't do it. So now that you're not wrong, what are you doing? How about you, Adam? We're having Thanksgiving at my apartment. Ooh. I don't have to go back to Las Vegas. No Vegas, dude. Your parents are immigrants, too. My parents are immigrants, but they embrace a lot of American shit. They assimilated like bitches on like my dad who hates America. He doesn't like basketball or anything. He hates everything, dude. Really? He hates it all. If we didn't even take the language, fuck no. You couldn't even really speak to me. Well, my parents were English-speaking immigrants. Right. We had a little bit easier. My dad got kicked out of his citizenship exam. Did he? Yeah, yeah. Because they... This is a bullshit. Literally, yes. He was like... Because he couldn't spell things, right? And they were marking him wrong. And he was like, I don't want to be a fucking citizen anyway. Literally, he did just like that fucking... He got kicked out. He got tossed and he never went back. So wait, he's just overstaying his visa now? I think he's got some kind... I mean, I don't know. Hopefully he's legal. Because I will report him. We will report his ass. It would be so funny if because Trump, my dad gets deported. I'm gonna report his ass. Dude, don't do it, dude. Don't report him. I wouldn't... I won't say his name. Yeah. It's a scary time. You know, it's like in the first Care Bears movie when they call the cousins. Yeah. We can all help. But did they win? Did they beat Trump in the Care Bears? Yeah. Hillary becomes president in the Care Bears. I just found out that woman, Tulsi Gabbard, on our Smart Politics episode. That was like, yeah, she's gonna be the next president. She's a U.N. ambassador. No, that's Nikki Haley. No, no, that's Nikki Haley. Yeah, well, she just got it. But they were talking about Tulsi. She met with Trump. She met with Trump, yeah. She's also a fundamentalist Hindu. She like supports Prime Minister Modi and India like killing... Oh, Modi supported genocide. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like killing like all the Muslims in India. Jesus Christ. She was like protesting against gay marriage like real hard. What? Yeah, yeah. What's the good thing you open your stupid mouth about it? When I say smart shit, yeah, yeah. You're wrong. You're also wrong about the fucking stock market, which nobody has apologized to me for you. I never said that. He did on the election night. Everyone was like, oh, the fucking stock market's gonna happen. No, I said immediately on election night that they were gonna be running hog wild and like making a ton of money until the next fucking collapse and we have to bail them out again in front of... No, no, no. Everyone was like, oh, the markets are collapsing. I was like, it'll bounce back. No, and he's gonna have a fucking political operative as chairman of the Fed. He's gonna lower interest rates around election times and he's gonna keep winning. But that doesn't mean that we're gonna have an overall healthy economy. What do you think the next bubble is? The next bubble? Yeah. I mean, financial institutions are gonna... It's gonna be the same thing. Financial institutions are gonna get way too big and if any of them fail, we're gonna have massive systemic failure and it's gonna tank the entire economy. It probably won't be a finance industry that does it. It's probably gonna be the... The market. What market is gonna... The sex doll. The sex doll. Sex doll industry. Sex doll. I think water and now. You think water is gonna do it? I think water is the most important thing in the next hundred years. Yeah? Yep. They're gonna like fucking... We have more water though. The glaciers are melting. See, look, these people, they don't even think these things through. Look at him. He's making up excuses now. We're gonna melt the ice caps. Everybody's gonna import the melted ice caps all the way to Flint. I think that... The TransPP bill. The TransPP bill. The TransPP bill lets trans people go to China for free to pee pee in the Cokeers revenge. Sounds good to me, but it costs a lot of people toilet making jobs. I went to a toilet factory in Flushing Queens where they invented the toilet. I met all these people. They love me. I said, we're gonna flush Hillary. So he's not locking her up now? No, he's not locking her up. You should go to r slash lock her up. It's pretty funny right now. Oh, is it? Yeah, yeah. That sounds great. Yeah, they're very upset. Yeah. Oh, yeah. They're like, he's not the FBI. He's just a fucking president, man. He's like, he can't tell them not to lock her up. Yeah, they're pissed. Yeah. I love how much they want Hillary Clinton to be in jail. Oh, no. Like, why do you peep? I mean, look, Trump this week is like, first of all, I met Obama. He's a really cool guy. Yeah. First of all, he's really, really cool. My man Kushner is just running shit. It looks like. Who's got a hilarious name? Kush? Kushner. You know what's got a better name than Mike Crapo? Yeah. The, uh, what is it? The Crap Man. Hey, Crapster. Where is he from? I'm with Crap. I'm with Crap. God damn if he ran for anything and fucking. Who is that guy? Who's Mike Crapo? He's a. Hold on. Hold on. He's you. He's a senator from Idaho or congressman or something? I don't know. Fuck. Is he really me? Yeah, he's you, dude. That's fucked up, dude. Whatever, dude. He'll be in a bathroom trying to fuck a guy. That's why they want to keep trans people out of the bathroom. Because that's where they try to fuck us. I might accidentally fuck a trans person. I'm trying to. I'm trying to fuck a real man. I'm trying to have sex with a real man in the bathroom stupidly. I've made that joke. I've made that joke. Yeah. Well, I just made it now. I just heard you made that joke. I said it on stage. None of us witnessed that. Sounds like you're fucking lying again. I'm not lying. When? Where? What show? Crooked a piece of shit. I did it at the Hollywood Improv. I did it at the Hollywood Bowl. The Hollywood Bowl. I did it at fucking Carnegie Hall, dude. Really? The Carnegie Deli in line. Across the street from Carnegie Hall. They named the hall after the deli? Yeah, it was there first. God damn it. You learn a new thing about this city every freaking day. That's what I love about it. Andrew Carnegie actually took his name from the deli. He named himself after the deli. He was a trans woman that lived in the bathroom. When he got rid of his dead name, he chose Andrew Carnegie after the deli. He chose his name because he likes the sandwiches. We should go to Deli. We should get Deli for lunch. You guys want to get Deli for lunch? Not really. I want there to be something funny to happen in this episode. I feel bad about it. Wait, there's funny stuff? No, you know what? It's my fault because I wore workout clothes. I got too comfortable. Yeah, your T-levels are out of control, dude. You're wearing your compressions, right? I'm too masculine right now. It's no time to be funny. You just want to fucking get yoked. Yeah, I want a snowboard. I want to fucking pull Sean White's bitch-ass hair. How dare he have that hair on my mountain? He doesn't have it anymore. He cut it. Not on my mountain. Not on my beach. This is a soda drinking, crew cut wearing fucking mountain. Yeah. And if you ponytail boys come up here again, I'm going to tie your balls to the fucking chair lift and put that shit on full blasts and rip them off. Holy shit. Yeah. And I just fucked him up, man. And he serves, too, dude. He serves? Yeah. Not on my water mountain. No, this beach is locals only. Hey, locals only. Hey, everybody do the shock-assign, Adam. Listen, look at these fucking bay-hay over here, man. This fucking boo-hoo bay-hay. Fucking bay-hay. Is this Hawaii? Hawaii voted for Trump, right? No. Hawaii's like the most liberal state in America. Hawaii loves Trump. They love him. They got that hair cut. His hair cut looks like the ocean. That is true. That is true. They do love the water. The clouds over the ocean. He's very tan. They love tanning. Do they still have a king? They love having skin cancer. Yeah, they all do have a skin. Didn't they used to have a king? They have a king? I feel like the king of Hawaii is the guy that eats a 15-pound burger and gets his picture on the wall. No, it's the guy from the punch. It's whoever the fattest, Simone. It's the king of the buffet. Yeah, I'm about to challenge myself. Mahalake. Yeah. Let's do a Hawaiian episode. This man has drank so much coconut milk. This beach is locals only, bro. The king is the guy from the punch, the punch guy. What punch? Hawaiian punch. Oh, that guy. You know that's a hat? Yeah, I didn't know it was a hat. That's crazy. You thought it was antlers. You thought it was part of his head. Yeah, I thought it was some weird antlers. No, it's a hat. It was weird hair. Well, they updated it. They got a new Hawaiian punch guy now who looks like he has cancer, by the way. Yeah, he does not look good. Why is he so fucking pale? Yeah, I thought it was some weird ginger, like the ginger in a city of God. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're like, I understand he's actually from the favela, but do you understand how confusing this is going to be in racist American audiences? Ron Weasley. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Why the fuck Archie Andrews is in, you know. Yeah, he should be denying these people welfare in an office area. He shouldn't be in the slums. Karen. Yeah, fucking carrot top in Brazil. Dude, that guy looks fucked up. I met him once. You met the guy? I saw him at Costco. I thought you met the guy? What? Carrot top? Carrot top. At Costco in Vegas? Yeah, yeah, he lives in Vegas. I would love to walk up to Carrot top and be like, man, I just got to ask you, where did your name come from? And then just act completely blown away. I was like, it's because I have red hair. They're like, oh my God. I never realized that. Mr. Top, big fan. Dude, he was buying so many props. You want to know something artistic about me? My friend like quizzed me one time. Sonic came up. Sonic the Hedgehog. And like, do you know Tails? Sure. He's like, do you know Tails is full name? It's like, yeah, it's Miles Tails Per Hour, which is his full name. His name is Miles Per Hour. What the fuck? That's true. I happen to know that. And he's like, yeah, it's Miles Per Hour. And I was like, oh, and I just, yeah, it's Miles Brower. But I had just known that it was Miles Prower. And he was like, wait, you just remembered that as a name? I was like, yeah, I didn't understand why that character. I never thought about it. I thought it was, yeah, it was just like a weird deformed animal that has like a man's name for some reason. Like a black tax attorney's name. Yeah. Yeah, it sounds like it. It's the law office of Miles Prower. Esquire. It sounds like a personal injury. Please leave a message and we'll get back to you at our earliest convenience. Sounds like a, like a South Central LA personal injury attorney. That's basically an identical joke to what I just said, that adds nothing. That adds literally nothing to what the fuck I just said. You're going to take the joke and now I'm going to make it mine by saying the exact same fucking thing again. You couldn't even go on with another middle class occupation about a TV the other day. That's a classic. Yeah, that's a classic Adam right there. I got a 3k. Shut up, bitch. 3k TV. Tails was a small boy that Sonic fucked, right? Yeah, Sonic fucked Tails. Sonic fucked Tails. I think that was like a video game thing. Donkey Kong used to fuck Diddy Kong. What was Knuckles thing? Did he fuck Sonic? No, he punched. He was a punch guy. He loved punching. But do you think he fucked Sonic? Was there a woman in this universe? Yeah, there's a girl. And I don't know if she's a- She was yellow. Amy. Amy is the girl. And did Dr. Robotnik fuck anyone? No, Dr. Robotnik is asexual German. Was he German? Yeah. Well, maybe he's Russian or something. I always figured like he was the villainous Jew. You know what I mean? I always thought he was like a villainous Jew. Right, didn't you? One of the classic archetypes. Yeah. I wish I could grow his facial hair. Like just giant orange triangles coming out from the sides of my face. Yeah, what is that? It's just like a Chester B. Arthur cut. Yeah, they just put no effort into animating this shit. They make it. You know, all of it stems from like when video games were like fucking 8-bit. Right. So the proportions fit into whatever they could make look like a distinct shape, you know, on that screen. So when it became a cartoon and they just kept going with that blueprint, they were like, what the fuck is this? I guess that's just what this guy looks like. It just becomes sort of freaky, messed up shit. Some weird oval. I don't remember what he looks like. What's up with Chris Chan these days? With who? Chris Chan. Who's Chris Chan? Oh, you don't know who Sonichu is? No. Christian Weston Chandler? No. Oh my God. How the fuck did, how have I not told you guys that before? Is this like a computer thing? No. It's the most trolled individual in the history of the internet. Really? So it sounds like a computer thing. Yeah. I mean, I don't even know if it would be worth it to go into it because I'm sure everyone listening to this knows who Chris Chan is. I think probably a lot of people don't. Like me and Snow. Well, you're completely ignorant to what I'm talking about, so I don't even know what your frame of reference is to say people do or don't know about it. I just, I think we have a lot of listeners. Yeah, okay. Well, I'm sure a lot of them, anyhow. So about 10 years ago, about 10 years ago, this guy got popular on the internet. I'm like mostly on 4chan. It was an autistic guy, like a 24-year-old autistic guy, lives with his parents for posting this video, where he's like, it's wrong to be gay. Oh, hell yeah. Being gay is incorrect and you should always be straight, you know, or whatever. But he's got around his neck this weird medallion made out of model magic that looks like a yellow sonic. Hell yeah. And people dig deeper and they find all these cartoons. He makes comics that looks like shitty. He has the artistic abilities of a fucking 10-year-old. So he draws these comics called Sonichu, which is a character he created that's just Sonic combined with Pikachu. Oh, that's cute. Yeah. But he's a homophobe. He's weird. So, you know, people would like to sort of observing him, but over the years, the trolls became more and more involved in his life. And he had all of these ongoing dramas and his main things, at least 10 years ago, where he was in search of a boyfriend-free girlfriend. True. And he just self-described a boyfriend-free sweetheart. Oh, hell yeah. So he would put up, he would have a sign that he would write up that he'd be like, I'm looking for a girlfriend. And he would go sit on the community college campus. But then he had qualifies on there like, she has to be white. She cannot be, you know, like just racist and stuff. You're not allowed to be fat or whatever. Hell yeah. He's just a statistic guy. And like the dean of students, you know, kicked him off and he got into this feud with the dean or whatever. And then he was constantly being banned from his local game shop. So he had these feuds going with it, you know, and he would make these videos of like, create a character and like soul caliber of him murdering the dean. He would like make the dean then make a character for himself and then have videos of him stabbing the dean. And then the police had to get involved and like, you know, and it just got better and better and better. So he had this quest to find a, he could describe himself as a, as no vio phobic, which is some bizarre combination of Spanish and Latin or Greek, I guess. Yeah. Which means a boyfriend free or boyfriend phobic, you know. Okay. And so he became a, but he just stalks women. Like, you know, there's a woman that worked at the mall that was nice to him. And so he like, unfortunately she was nice to him. So he would just like wait outside the store and stare at her and she'd be like, get out of here. And he would like run away, you know, come back and stuff. Jesus Christ. So as he got more and more attention online for his shitty comics, like people started trolling him. And it was all these like 12 year old boys that would call him up because they sounded like girls. And they would pretend to be girls to troll this grown autistic man. Oh fuck. What did he live with parents? His parents. Yeah. And you know, so then obviously his nudes got leaked and videos of him fucking blow up doll. Yes. And screaming like, oh, Julie, I love you, Julie. Oh my god. A 12 year old boy pretending. And this was like all happening 10 years ago. And he's got, so now he's trans. Is he? He's trans. He basically killed his own father. I think he set their house on fire. He got them kicked out of their house because he uploaded. He's like a tour of our home and the department of like health found the video and their home is just in disarray and trash everywhere. What? So they got, they got taken out of their home. And a couple of years ago, he got arrested again. We'll buy him a computer. It'll be good for him. Yeah. He got arrested again at GameStop because they changed. Get this. This is one of my favorite recent Christian things. Sony changed the color of Sonic's arms from tan to blue. Yes. Oh. And he's like, that's not what Sonic's arms look like. Yes. And so he went into the GameStop. And his video of him doing it, he's just, he's fully trans now. So he's dressed like a woman and he goes into the GameStop and he's trying to color in Sonic's arms with like a blue magic marker. Yes. And the employees are like, what are you doing? And he starts macing the employees. Oh, what? Yeah. And he's like, how stupid you are that like, Sony makes a change. Yeah. So you go to your local GameStop and decide that's what's going to change it. That's what's going to change it around. Dude, you got to be the change you see. Yeah. No. He's, he's so good. You know what? And, but he's from an older version of the internet that was much fucking meaner. And that's where like, you know, Brandon and all these fucking idiots are like, oh, I love BB or whatever. It's like, you know, you're exploiting him. Right. And the older fucking generation of internet people had the courage to be mean to these people. Yeah. Positive control. Yeah. Pretend like you care about fucking BB, Brandon. You're laughing at a retarded man. Fucking own it. Yeah. Oh, BB's so nice. Oh, no, BB. Shut up. No, don't support Trump, BB. BB must be thrilled. Isn't BB a Trump supporter? Yeah. Huge shrimp. Oh, fuck dude. What are you wearing the clothes on? I don't feel like recapping Sonichu for people who already know about Christian. It's really worth it. Um, geez. What are, what are, uh, what else? I've had nothing, man. I've been dealing with this legal bullshit all week. Yeah. And I won by the way. I can't go into details, folks, but, uh, chop one up for the little guy. Yeah. Just looking good. Adam, have you fucked recently? Oh, actually I haven't fucked. Really? Hit a little bit. Yeah. How it's a little bit? Uh. It's your dick. Shut the fuck up, Nick. Take that back. No. Dude, take that shit the fuck back. No. Take your dick back to the tiny dick store. Dude, I lost the receipt. So I can't even, I can only get store credit. No, but if they look up your, if you paid for it with your debit card, they could look it up. I didn't, it was a cash transaction. You paid cash for your tiny dick? Yeah. Hey, that's so stupid. Fuck, man. Now I tell you, these tiny dicks, a lot of people say that the girls don't like them, but they're wrong. I tell you, they're absolutely wrong. The girls go crazy for these tiny dicks. It's true. The only thing they want is to have their clit played with. And that's the whole secret of the penis game. Now I'm telling you, because you don't look like a sucker to me. You look like a straight shooter and I respect you. And so what do you say? Right now, right here, let's do it together. Let's make a cash deal. For this tiny little dick. I don't know, mister. Just do it. I'm telling you, I'm looking at you now and I can see that you want it. For this amount of money, can you get a bigger dick? I'm not sold. I'm interested, but I'm not sold. I think you have to sell me a little harder. Look, maybe you want to put in the ass in the future. What we're doing is future-proofing here. Maybe big dicks are in now, but I'm telling you, in five and a half years, everybody's going to want to narrow to an extension. I don't know how. Look what happened to this sedan market. Everyone was saying big cars were going to drive a big car. Oh, we want a big car. And then the Japanese came in with their tiny dicks and everyone wanted a tiny one. That is true. He's making good points. I'm telling you, look, listen to me very close here. You have to sign on the line. Listen, I got to talk to my wife before I make any- Don't do that. Don't talk to her, that fucking bitch. That bitch, she's a cut. She just doesn't want me to make financial decisions. She can't listen to her for anything. Without her permission. For any one of these women driving a working man mad. What kind of dick do you have, sir? I don't worry about what kind of dick I have. I have whatever dick I need to have. This is about you. This is about a deal I'm giving you here, Shelly. I'm telling you. Well, it's just she- we have a joint checking account. And she's going to see the charge and I just want to get her permission before I- I think we've done enough checking. I don't think that's really adding anything to that. Thanks for trying, Adam. What about the insurance policy? Just get more and more mundane into the dick? Is there a warranty on the dick? That's really the only impression I can do is him. Oh, that's not true, Nick. You're a good actor. Thanks. Did you guys know that listeners that Nick in secret is a good actor? He's going to be in a new movie. I'm actually method acting as a guy that's not actually racist. For the podcast? For the podcast. Oh, I see. That's cool. Yeah. That's a fun act. No, that whole method acting thing. It sounds like bullshit to me. It is bullshit. No, like Val Kilmer's like- You're the greatest actor of all time is? Who? Jennifer Aniston. Yeah. I'm serious. Jennifer Aniston. Jennifer Aniston. True. She says, she goes, you just remember the lines. You just say the words. That's it. That's it. That's all it is. That's really all the fucking- No, no, no. Some people that are charismatic and then they're just like that in their, you know, everyday lives, but yeah, acting is- Well, no, you got to get a haircut and then- You got to get a haircut. You got to get a haircut and then you just- Well, the rage- They put on cool clothes. And then you say the words. You could see- So, there was an era of French where you could see so much nip and it was tight. Yeah. What? Everyone was showing nip. Everyone was showing nip. I was like a bra-free, like bra-free air kind of 90s. Hell yeah, dude. We're feminists. You know what was crazy on that show is like, so Joey and Chandler have an apartment together and then they like watch Baywatch because it was- Hot. It was network television, yeah. So, the implication there was that, you know, that was like TV code for- Joey and Chandler would sit around watching porn beating off together. Well, no, there was an episode where they would watch- They watched porn. What? So, I think- Yeah, there's an episode where like you get porn for free or whatever. So, the actual implication is that they literally were watching Baywatch and beating off together, I think. Well, maybe they thought it was a good show. Which is even stranger, I think. Yeah. They were watching Baywatch with your broys and beating off. That had to have been like one of the EPs was also collecting royalties on Baywatch and they're like, it has to be in the show. You have to force people to watch Baywatch. I think it was like a 90s culture. Another thing people don't realize is that theme song was just written for the show. Yeah, it was. A lot of people think that that's a song that was just on the radio and then they used it for the show. Guys, really? I have an idea. Yeah. What about, we don't have a theme song right now. We get the Rembrandts to do it. We get the Rembrandts. Or we just use the Friends theme song. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. You want to use the Friends theme song now? Jobs, Joe, you broke. Your love life's got HIV. There you go. Yeah, they're not really broke. I'm gay, I've never had sex with a woman. They all had pretty good jobs. Joe's an actor. They lived in the West Village. Yeah. But he never got, he's called Joe. I mean, this is well. Joe, he's like a successful actor. Yeah, I don't want to go into the bit about how Friends is unrealistic because they have a nice apartment. Please don't do that. I'm just saying that the theme song is a lot of lies. Yeah, the theme song is a lie. I wish people fucked as much as people fucking said cops. Also, where's that, that fountain's in Central Park, right? Uh, yeah, that's the Angels in America fountain. If you did that in that fountain, you would be arrested. Yeah. You would be arrested. Unrealistic. There weren't that many people around, man. Yeah. You tell me there wasn't anybody around. You just take your time. Here's my question. The dance move. The Hulk gets mad. How does he, how does the shorts stay on? That's what I wanted to know. Who made Superman's costume? Oh, shit. Where'd he get that? So true. Where's that come from? He probably made it himself. Right? How is he also just like a journalist? He's just also a successful journalist and that never comes up. Well, he went to school. Well, he was smart. He grew up in Kansas. He went to college. But you never hear anything about his journalism career in the comics that I've never read or really paid attention to at all. Yeah, there's probably an actual explanation for that one. Yeah. You run it by Mike Lawrence. He's like, actually, there's a whole side story. Yeah, you probably read the comics about the journalism school. It's just Superman's articles about municipal legislation and fucking Gotham City or whatever. Yeah. He just went and exposed it sitting there during the pages, just a drawing of a newspaper that's like, the city council met today to discuss the new bus terminal. Meribeth Avenue. This is good stuff. It's him trying to get fucking student loans. Student loan paperwork's in order. All right. Well, none of this is funny. But you know, we did an extra long episode. How long was it? This is our 10 minutes. 10 free minutes. Hold on. Hold on. Let's plug the show. We got a show on Monday. This Monday, come on, everybody. I forgot to ask Sam. But Liza Trayger's on it. Liza Trayger. Jordan Temple. Liza. Jordan Temple. Liza. What does that say, Liza? Liza Trayger. She's an actual friend of mine, and I know her name. And it's not Trayger. He said it wrong. Trayger. It's Trayger. Liza. Liza Trayger. Well, Liza's on it. And she's funny. And she's hilarious. And Jordan Temple's on it. He's very funny too. And then Sam, Mike. Oh, yeah. I saw him. I forgot to ask him. It's double. Anyway, yeah. Come to the show. It's going to be good. That's it. All right. You finished? Yeah, we're done. Turn this off now. Yeah, turn it off. Just shut the fuck up, bitch. No. You know why? Why? Keep this... Turn the fucking thing off. I'll turn it off when I'm ready to turn it off. I'm hungry. Turn it off. I want to go... Turn it off. I want to go to Katz's... Lock her up. We're not going to fucking Katz's. I've been to Katz's. It's not very good. We're not going to fucking Katz's. I want to go to the fucking bake pies. We're going to talk about the Katz's Stealy thing. The fake orgasm. I don't know. Sorry. I probably did. We did? We definitely did. You know what a podcast is for? It's for all the shit that you know would not work at open, Mike. Yeah, that's what we're doing with each other. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll tell you. I got a TV. Shut up. Just press the fucking button. Let's go make pies. Don't fucking. Do it, bitch. All right. Just end them. No, hold on. Here's what I'm gonna do I can turn your mic off now I get the final no now I get the final word Yeah, I turned both of your mics off so that's been the episode guys thanks for listening it's not gonna pick up",

too.\"},{\"currTime\":1858,\"text\":\"Yeah, have sex with every girl in the class and then sit back down at my seat and then\"},{\"currTime\":1862,\"text\":\"start time again.\"},{\"currTime\":1863,\"text\":\"And then you would just see every girl in the class suddenly just be like, oh, and\"},{\"currTime\":1868,\"text\":\"then I know what happened and I'm just

        "transcript_text": " Hello. Hello everyone, welcome to another edition of your favorite podcast, Come Town. Hey there you go dude, is that your first intro? I think so. I think I tried it once and I didn't do it professionally. We got Adam on the 1's and 2's. I like the idea of a guy that doesn't know what 1's and 2's means. What does it mean? It means like two turntables. Oh shit. Turntable 1 and turntable 2. Oh man, we should have just not told him then Stav could have been that guy. He was until this very moment. Can I be honest, that was my guess. I love guys that say things wrong. When I worked at GameStop, I worked at GameStop as a seasonal employee and then the manager there was this guy Bill that we tried. That was your career. It's fine. What's that? We get it seasonal. That's one of your credits? Like on a stand-up lineup? Yeah. I worked at GameStop. Seize the little play? Sure you're over there. Then I won't tell the story. Tell the story. It's funny. GameStop is a funny place. Yeah. I'm sure the story is going to be funny. You're a good story teller. Thanks. I'm feeling bad about myself lately. No no, tell the story. I bought shorts and they don't have pockets and they make me look like a five-year-old. These are my good shorts but they're ruined. Those are your good shorts? Yeah. Those look fucking stupid as shit. It's almost not shorts weather anymore. These are not your good shorts. Those are just the shorts you always wear. That doesn't make them good. Yeah, they have, I see like four holes in the front. They're black. They were black but they're like bronze. Somehow your shorts are rusted. They're light brown now. Yeah, but they had rust on their shorts. How is cotton rusted? They're working. From working? From being a working man? Yeah, from working hard. Well they look gay. Working hard, hardly working. So anyways, I was at GameStop working there. Yeah. When I worked there. And the manager, Bill, was just retarded. And I mean it wasn't like an actual retard. I mean he's like a fucking idiot. Yeah. He was retarded. Sorry, the cat is... We don't have kingdom hearts. The cat... Yeah, yeah. Sound wee. The cat's chewing a dead mouse in the living room right now. Yo, fuck this cat man. No, actually that's the cool cat. No, there's no cool cat. Now it's like batting it with its hand and it doesn't understand that it's dead. It's like Lenny. It's pulling a Lenny right now. If we get up close to it, it'll put the mouse back in its mouth. Yeah. Alright, so as we're going to GameStop, I can't have to podcast your rail this quickly. Absolutely not. This is not the... I already decided the other episode is going to be the bonus episode. So this one's got to be good or... It's called the N-word threshold. Okay. If the n-bombs are dropped, it becomes premium content. Oh, shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what people said. Yeah. What's going to happen? Do we say the N-word on the bonus one? I told that story about my dad with the Australian guy. Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which I had to say it. I mean... Yeah, you had to. It was so funny. Yeah, guys, that's premium though. You bitch-ass motherfuckers who don't have that won't ever find it. You're not going to hear that great story about that Australian guy using the N-word. So, yeah, when I worked at GameStop, the manager was this guy Bill. Did I already tell the story or no? I don't think so. Oh, man. So Bill, yeah. Bill would just hear people say things and then repeat them like the Big Lebowski without understanding what they meant. And like one time he was like... Yeah, I'm planning on... I want to put these games here but then Forte these other games above them. He's like, what the fuck? He's like, you just guessed completely. He's like, no context. It sounds good. Yeah, it sounded alright. It does sound pretty good. Forte it. Yeah. Yeah, one time he was like... He was using the word preface wrong like a bunch. Kept saying preface incorrectly. One time he just shit his pants. I know that. I was going to ask you about it. I remember you told me that story. What happened for that again? He fucking... I came into work. First of all, this dude lived in Bel Air and the store was in... Bel Air, Maryland. Yeah, and the store was in Rockville. Which, that's a two hour drive. That's very far. If you're lucky, it's two hours. It's a two hour drive, yeah. That's basically DC. Yeah, he would drive all the way down every morning and work bell to bell every day. He wasn't an hour. He was a salary employee. Right. He was a manager, so he got his like $20,000 a year to manage the game stop. And so he didn't have to be there, but he would work 73 hour weeks. And I remember asking him one time. I'm like, Bill, why do you do that? And he was like, well, I'll tell you what. It impresses the district managers are all pleased with me. All of the area managers are pleased with me. And, you know, that's the kind of thing that's important for moving up. And it's like, Bill, you don't have a college degree. You're never going to move past store manager. You don't hire store managers as like district managers. Right. You're already, you're done. You got to the top. You know, the game stop would let him if he beat Zelda fast enough be a district manager. Yeah, yeah. That's how it works. He also told me he's like, also do loss prevention for the district, which was a lie. They don't have that, I don't think. And I have a guy that just does loss prevention. And then that store, I told you that story. That store got robbed one time. I didn't get robbed. They had this like a frame with all like Game Boy games in it. This is already like, I don't know, it's probably like 2007. So Game Boy was really on his last legs. It was done. Yeah. So the game's costs, like if you wanted to buy them, they were maybe like three bucks a piece. Yeah. The trade in value is nothing. So the entirety of this case was worth maybe like, you know, $4 worth of merchandise. Adam just, Adam got the mouse and he's putting it in his pocket, maybe to sell later. The market. Listen. The market template. You don't know how much these go for these days. Yeah. Watch it with the fucking wires. I'm going to put the mic down, throw it out real quick. Okay. All right. Tell the story. I want to hear this fucking. So Game Boy, a frame full of Game Boys. Yeah. So fuck, I should have drank some coffee. No, that's fine. This is a good story. I'm fucking it up. It's Adam's fault for stealing, forgetting the mouse. It's just. It was distracting me. I'm sorry. It was distracting everybody. There's a fucking dead mouse on the floor. I can't see it because it's blocked by the table. It was really distracting. Thank you. We really have to call an exterminator for the Anthony Cumea studios. Yeah. It's fucking. Well, and it got in a little bit of trouble calling exterminators. They told them we don't do black guys and just please stop calling. Yep. So he actually can't do business with any of those, any of the companies in New York City. He called every single exterminator in New York and asked them to exterminate. How do you get rid of these fucking people? I'm sure you find one. In New York? Yeah. It's big city. Yeah. I'll do it. I got a guy for that. How big is he? Yeah. Oh, you said he was a rat wink, wink. No problem. He just murders the guy in broad daylight. He just goes to jail. Now, I'll be seeing about that $25 you owe me. Pow. Yeah. So this fucking case with these Game Boy games and it was worth nothing. Somebody had that glass sliding doors in the front, but the comment that was like, you know, there's locks with the teeth. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So somebody found that you could like wiggle them on the sides just enough to like steal like the sides of the, so they stole like 10 Game Boy games off the side. And I like just noticed it. And I told the assistant manager, John, who was like 34 and wore like an Indiana Jones hat and his like shitty face, like facial hair and like this shitty stringy hair. And I told John and Bill and, you know, I thought they'd just be like, oh, okay. And they both come over and they're like crossing their arms and like huffing and puffing and they're like, damn it. You know, and John's looking at it and he looks at, he looks at Bill and he's like, this was probably a professional thief. Dude. Yeah. Fucking. Yeah. Ocean's 11. Daddy Ocean. Yeah. And stole your fucking Game Boy games. Stole Dr. Mario for Game Boy. Yeah. Yeah. That shit was, that shit was so fucking funny. That's incredible. Yeah. No, Bill shit his pants one time. I like went into the store and I had to like open with him. This is like the morning I'm tired of shit. I don't really want to be there. Of course. And I go in and Bill's like, would you mind setting that up over there for me? Thanks. And he like turns around and walks back to the counter and as soon as he turns around, it's like on his ass, there's like shit splattered on the back of his pants. Oh no. Not like on, there's like brown like shit splattered. But it didn't make sense because you know, if you shit your pants, you shit on the other side. Right. So I don't know. He's somehow shit on the back of his pants. He just seeped through. No. I'm assuming he had like diarrhea or something and like was rushing to pull his pants down and shit on the, he's shit on the back of them while like trying to sit down and shit. Interesting. Okay. Well, I was like, I was like, great. This is fantastic. And so as other like employees were coming into the store that day, I'd be like, oh, yeah. Hey, Jeremy, how was your weekend? Oh, by the way, Bill shit his pants. If you want to take a look, you can see he shit his pants. I called my friend Matt and because like, you know, I'd made fun of that guy so much. Yeah. And Matt's like, no way. He shit his pants. I was like, yeah, he shit his pants. Two hours later, I was just, you know, like stocking the shelves or something. And I just hear from behind me, my friend Matt's voice. He's like, can I tell him? I'm like, man, I didn't come to the store to see it. He's like, can I tell him shit his pants? Yeah. That dude ran over a child on his way to work one morning. What? Yeah. He got to work like 20 minutes late and he's like, that's it. Sorry, I'm late. And he, but maybe it was a little bit long then he goes. He's like, sorry, I'm late. He's like skidded on the ice and my car went into a 14 year old girl and she got hit up on the roof, but the police said it was her fault. She didn't have the right of way. So I was clear to come to work and I was like, Bill, go home. Yeah. There's no reason for you to be here. He just hit a fucking child. Yeah. He ran over a child on his way to GameStop. That day shit his pants was the only day he actually left when his shift ended. Yeah. He was like, wow, three o'clock. I'm, I'm tired. I'm beat. I'm ready to go. What is that? Oh man, I wonder what that guy's up to now. I don't know. He told me about like when I am interviewed for the job. For some reason he's like, well, I'll tell you a little bit about me. He was like, I was enlisted in the army after the army. I worked at Suncoast video and worked my way up to manager and I was there for 17 years. Jesus, I'm fucking old. But how old was he for real? He was like probably like 37, 38. Damn. Yeah. But I don't understand why that was part of the interview process. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's just hoping he's friends. Yeah. Doesn't matter. Imagine that working at a Suncoast video. What a depressing store. We never had this. We just had Blockbuster and Hollywood video. Suncoast video wasn't a rental place. What was it? It was a video retailer. They sold like, yeah, they sold. They sold camcorders and tapes. No, they sold like VHS tapes and like posters and shit. DVDs later. DVDs later. It was like a Sam Goody. It was exactly the same Goody. It was like a place where you could get like box sets, like compilations of shows and stuff. Okay. Jesus dude, how can you imagine people would fucking go to the mall to a Suncoast video if they wanted to like watch season three of a show they liked? Yeah. That shit sucks, dude. Yeah. That was a whole fucking industry. Yeah. And now it's just like, that asshole doesn't have a job anymore. Yeah. Fucking dickheads like that. You know what's funny is you think back to and it's like, yeah, but you know, you had the shit you were entertained by and you didn't think you were missing out on anything. That's true. Within the context. But I remember being like 13 and like just getting so bored I would get fucking like angry. Yeah. You know, and start breaking shit. You know, light stuff on fire. Like that's what causes that is like fucking bored. No Netflix. Yeah. I just get pissed off that there was nothing to do. Yeah. I fucking, I remember once I got the Chappelle show DVDs, I just watched those. That was it. Yeah. That was the time when the DVD box that was king. That was the best fucking thing on earth. Everyone in college had that box set. Oh yeah. And that's why Dave Chappelle is like super rich now. Yeah. The first thing I ever watched online, I think was trailer park boys. Oh yeah. There's a website. It was like, no, it was on like ice films or TV, TV links. That was the website. TV links. Hell yeah. Yeah. TV links.something. That EU. Yeah. And I watched trailer park boys on there and you stick forever for that shit to buffer. Yeah. You'd have just fucking pause it and walk away. Yeah. Yeah. Pause it and wait. Yeah. Like a half hour and you could watch a whole fucking TV show. Yeah. I thought this is like the greatest thing in the fucking world. Watching like a TV show on my shitty like fucking 15 inch, but giant CRT monitor. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck dude. Then I would go get Arizona iced tea from CVS, which I remember thinking was healthy because it was iced tea. It was green. Yeah. No, I didn't drink the green tea. I just drank the regular iced tea. Oh really? Yeah. I'm like, it's tea. It's healthy. It's not like soda. I think Arizona iced tea was like put in urban areas by the CIA to kill like black people. They found out about the crack. It's 99 cents. Yeah. That's like just drink this tall boy. That's Bill Clinton's crack. Oh yeah. That was, yeah. Reagan is to crack as Bill Clinton is to Arizona tall boys. What the fuck did Obama do though? Obama just he just white people. He made white people move to Brooklyn. Yeah. More than the crack of the Obama administration. Human crack. Hey, whoa, whoa. You guys are the gentrifiers. I live in Astoria. Okay. Well, that's the podcast folks. Everyone, thank you so much for listening. Yeah. Please donate. Yeah. Thank you for bringing the content. If you check that shit out, we got N words for you. We just found out right before starting this that David Simon uses the N words on Twitter. That was awesome. David Simon is hot off the press. He's on a tear tonight, you know, using the N word and defending his use of it. Yeah, we can't say it because that would make this a premium episode. He went soft A and he thought that it was okay. The way he explains it, if you say soft A N word, the interlocutor of the grammatical, I don't know, some fucking nerd. It makes it not okay to use the N word. I feel like listen up black people. I went to college for saying the N word. I wrote your favorite show. He has literally typed out the N word on a word processor. Yeah. So many times. A million times. So many times. That is the word he has typed. He wrote the wire with dictation software. Oh, so he shouted. Yeah. It was that early shit that he had to shout at. He only wrote the dialogue for the black people though. It would be great to hack Stephen Hawking's computer and then just throw N words in there whenever he's talking to Neil deGrasse. You should get a weave on that. Yeah, a weave who's agreed to do the show because Sam Hyde wouldn't. We'll see if we can get weave to hack Stephen Hawking's. We should have weave on and just demand that he does that. I'm down for that. Please hack Stephen Hawking. Yeah, just give him things to hack. Oh, fuck. Yeah, look, I'm a little, I'm even more out of it than usual because we're going to go out to eat after this and I haven't eaten for a while. Dude, I took a fucking, I took one of those, yeah, I took one of those 7pm naps where you wake up and you feel like. That is the worst nap to take. Yeah, you wake up and you feel like there's like a bunch of blood in your nose. The nap where it's light outside, you wake up and it's dark and you just have no concept of space. I feel like you take those are the naps you take and you wake up and you're like, what the fuck? Why do I feel this way and your body was like secretly trying to die when you weren't like looking. It was like, oh, I'm not doing, I'm just hanging out. Like, why can't I feel one of my legs? Fuck dude. I mean, I know I'm getting fatter when my fucking legs go numb when I'm shitting. Yeah, that happens to me all the time. I don't think it's a weight thing. I think it's a candy crush thing. I think it's maybe eating a lot of shit. Yeah. Do you eat your own shit? I've been eating like my shit, my roommate shit. Yeah. But that's it. I mean, nobody else's. Yeah, you know how like. There's a place in Williamsburg that does a really good shit. You know how people like will like lock themselves in their garage with their car running to kill themselves? Yeah. Put like a hose from the tailpipe into the car. Just do that, but with your own ass. So it's a hose that goes up your ass and then you jam the other end of your mouth. It's a gentle. But it takes like four shits for it to fill up. They just sit in the library and leave a note. You just hold a note and you hand it to people and they're like, sir, what are you doing? It's a gentle way. Goodbye, cruel world. Put the hose back in your mouth. Fuck. I actually do have something fucking funny to talk about is I joined. When I was working at that dumb website before it got shut down, we were like, for some reason, we thought it would be good viral marketing to like join a bunch of weed groups and like fucking post jokes on Facebook. Yeah. But as a result, I forgot that I joined something called 420 BBW Freaks. It's just a bunch of fat bitches going live on Facebook and smoking once and sucking dick and they just show it. Go check out 420 BBW Freaks on Facebook. Yeah, they probably have no way of censoring Facebook live. They have no way of censoring. And it's also it's a bunch of guys trying to fuck fat bitches on Fabbage that love weed. It's so funny. Just guys posting their like glamour shots, like just like, hey, what's up ladies? Like, like if you like what you see, it's like he gets no likes. Yeah. And there's another guy. There's another guy who's like big, big ass dick pictures coming through. It'll be like, it'll be like a warning meme. And then in the comments, he posts pictures of his dick and the women are just like, nice. That got rules. And then I clicked on it and this bitch has just like, it's like some old white woman. It's like pictures that like her children's graduation and shit. It was, dude, was some of the best dick pictures. Warning. Big ass dick pics coming through. That's awesome. And then one said medium sized. It was really funny. Yeah. It's a good group. I got fucking, I like Raytheon on Facebook and the guys that leave comments on Raytheon's posts are the fucking best. Oh, yes. It's always a mustache, always a fucking baseball hat in the picture. The guys that have their, uh, their profile picture and their cover picture are the same. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Them twice. There's just one guy. I'm going to change my shit to that when I get home. Yeah. That's actually a good look. Yeah. Yeah. Oh fuck. Yeah. Guys, don't ever do the thing where you like somehow incorporate where the profile picture overlaps a cover photo. Like, check out this guy over here or anything like that. He's pointing up. That makes you an asshole. That makes you a stupid asshole. You look like a YouTuber if you do that shit. Right. That's the type of shit YouTubers. You got to go, you got to really up your social media game and think about these things. Oh yeah. Yeah. For example, post nude pictures of yourself. That's what I do. Shouts out to D. Guerrero's. Took some good ass pics of me. You'll see him soon, gang. If you follow me on Instagram at staveybaby. S-T-A-V-V-Y. Baby. Jump in those DMs. Try and fuck me. What do you say? That took pictures of you. I read into her today. Nomi, also great. Nomi. Nomi photo. Check her out. Now I'm just fucking. No means no. No. No means no. Nomi photo. I don't think she knows your name is Stave or Stavros, so she just kept calling you Stavey. Some people call me Stavey. Anyway, Stavey was over like two weeks ago and we took some. We did a session for maybe hour, hour and a half. It was just so great to work with. I was telling Stavey, I have this huge loft. You guys should do shows at my house. Why does she have a loft? She's rich. Is she rich or does she? She's rich. She's not a business out of there. She's really rich from, she runs a business where she takes sexy pictures of men. It's like, and women, I guess. It's called like booed war for talking to fruit. If Stave puts her out of business. Absolutely. Isn't that the technology? No, I wouldn't because I'm hot, bitch. People want to fuck me. Get this gas cat off my ottoman. I think she gets royalties from, she's worked for like Thompson Reuters or some big shit. Like anytime they run a picture of her, she gets a check. Nice. I wish I had that. You wish you had a photo. Apparently you can make a lot of money. My bit, like whenever I meet a photographer, like my asshole bit that I obviously repeat every single time I meet a photographer is they say, oh yeah, I'm a photographer. I like always just take my phone out. And I'm like, yeah, me too, buddy. Me too. That is a good bit. Does that go over? No, they hate it obviously. My favorite shitty open mic bit is when people are like, yeah, when I tell people a comic they're like, can you do a bit for me right now? And it's like, you're not a comedian. I hate that. There's nothing I hate more than that shit, dude. You wouldn't go up to a doctor and be like, yeah, just do some surgery for me right now. Actually, you would. If there was a fucking emergency that happened, if a fucking bomb went off, they would immediately be like, who here's a doctor? Fuck, that is hilarious. God damn, that's funny. The doctor would be like, what is this guy, a comedian? Why don't you make the comic do it? I'm not at work right now. You piece of shit. Quick, this man's in dire need of laughs. Back off, pal. God damn, I hate open mics. I fucking hate open mics. I hate stand-up comedy. I hate myself. I wish I was dead. Yeah. No, I'm with you on that one. I was dead the most out of us. Probably me right now. I think it fluctuates. I think you have- I'm on a high, actually, recently. Yeah, I'm doing bad this week. I was doing bad a couple weeks ago. I was doing bad about it, but I really do a lot of the time, just wish. You're on a nice even keel, though, where you're semi-depressed, but then you'll fuck like women for no reason that are hot as shit, and you'll still pretend to be sad. Well, I'm having an affair now. Even though you're smiling. Oh, are you? Yeah. Well, I'm the mistress. I had a whole bag of chipset and fell asleep on floor. On the floor. I didn't do anything. I bought plexiglass on Amazon today, and then I fell asleep on the floor. Really? That's the level of depression on that. That's pretty bad. But this motherfucker's talking about being a Goomar, dude. He's fucking cucking somebody. Well, I'm saying I'm winning. You're winning, yeah, but I think this is pretty interesting. He's cucking. Yeah, go finish your story. I mean, that's it. Stav said something really true to me about it, which is that you ultimately just start feeling like they're cheating on you with their boyfriend. Oh, now he's trying to beat you with his hat. The wisdom of a large woman. Stav wrote that. You should be on the view. I would love to be on the fucking view. I would love that shit. They should just rebrand the view. What if you thought the view was about fat people and not women? He thought it was like, yeah, it's a show for old fat people. This doesn't work, because they have those young- They have a couple of hot Republican bitches. Yeah, the Elizabeth Hassel. She's been off the show for a while. She's been gone. But I feel like there's always one hot Republican, right? Yeah, I think. I don't know. I haven't watched that show with any kind of... Has it been really on for 20 fucking years? That's crazy. Yeah, I remember when it debuted. Me too, which is fucked up. It used to be Barbara Walters, right? Barbara Walters. Barbara Walters, Rosie O'Donnell. No, she came in and out. Whoopie Goldberg. Whoopie was there. Yeah, I do mean Oprah. I did have to think about it. You know, I think sometimes I make myself laugh, the thing about being the color purple, but then I think I call her in my head the smell purple. I don't even know what that means, but it makes me laugh. Nice, man. The smell purple. The smell of purple. The smell instead of the color. Why does Oprah keep trying to act? She's still doing that? She's about to be in a movie again. I mean, you're fucking rich as hell. What is she trying to act in? She'll pop up in a movie, everyone. She was in the butler. She was. She was weird. I think she produces movies, and then she forces them to make her act, to let her act. She's in those. Get the fuck out of there, Oprah. Yeah, that is weird. And she's like... She has the worst production company name. Harpo? That's the most retarded shit in the world. Also, it's a Marx Brothers name, too. And it's just her name backwards, right? Yeah, that's her name backwards. So stupid. Our production company name is way better. Stovskay, LLC. I would fucking love it if that was the production company name. I might do that. I got to talk to that CPA. Yeah, hell yeah. The Child Pornography Authority. Yo, is this... Okay, I just put it together the other day. Is sports authority supposed to be a port authority party? Yeah, you texted us back. I think it is. That's the dumbest shit I've ever... No, it's not. I think it is. What about bus terminals moves sports merchandise? I don't know. When was Sports Authority started? It was either going to be that or Bad Lieutenant Sports of Call New Orleans. Sports of Call. That was the other name for the store. When was Sports Authority started? After Port Authority. Dude, I don't know which one was first in the store. The concept of a port authority. As a little kid, dude, the dream was to get fucking locked in a sports authority overnight and like... And molested? Yeah, get fucked by the day. Yeah, but then they hold along robbers and fucking tie your legs to basketball hoop and make you suck their dick. Put a bowling pin up my ass. Dude, imagine though. Show them a bunch of fun tarts. I fucking farted them out. That was the dream, man. Being molested in a real fun, chill way. That was funny the moment I was going to say so. I just love sports. Dude, just getting locked in. Did you ever want to be as a little kid get locked in places? No, my god. And like have your run of the place? If I was locked in a whole food. I used to have fucked shit. Exactly. In a whole foods? A whole foods. The department store was the best. The most shit. Yeah. The most different shit. But a sports authority was fun. Like you would fucking dunk and you could just like play with all the shit. Oh yeah. Trampling. I used to have a fantasy that I would do repeatedly in my head. And it was a weird like, I don't know. I would have a recurring dream that every window and door in my house like that led to the outside. If you open the door, there was just a giant ass. It was like a nightmare that there was a giant ass that was like jammed in there. The goofiest nightmare of all time. Yeah, yeah. So you couldn't leave the house because there was these giant like asses being like shoved through the windows and doors. Is this a dream or a fear? That was the dream. I can't remember. I just remember that was a prominent part of my childhood. And you felt scared of the asses. Yeah, yeah. I couldn't, there was no way to leave the house because of these asses or whatever. And then there was this other fantasies to have that there was like an underground tunnel I could go in. I had like my own panic room, like my own panic control room with like, you know, monitors that let out everywhere. And I could kill people with like remote machine guns and those kind of things. Now that sounded more like a huge fantasy. No, I actually talked to a couple of people and like numerous people had that. Really? You know, it's funny. I bonded with a friend of mine over like a couple of serial killers in junior high. I remember I used to fantasize about having like, what was that movie? Like, I don't even think I saw the movie, but just like there was like a, it was like kids had watches that could stop time. I don't know. Clock stoppers. I think that was the name of the movie. Oh yeah, it was Time Stop. Time Stoppers. Something like that. I didn't see it, but I understood the concept. Yeah. And I remember like in middle school thinking about like, how cool would it be if I could stop time and then have sex with every girl. I know dude, I thought that too. Yeah, have sex with every girl in the class and then sit back down at my seat and then start time again. And then you would just see every girl in the class suddenly just be like, oh, and then I know what happened and I'm just sitting there just super relaxed. You just come at times. Yeah. I just took like nine days to work my way through the entire classroom. Oh boy. Yeah, that was on heavy rotation, stopping time and touching titties all the time, dude. Yeah. It was fucking awesome. It's just rape. That's rape. That's what I was gonna say about rape. You're just dreaming of rape at an entire school. It's not rape if it's hypothetical. Because actually, you know what, that is like a fun physics question about would consent exist outside of a construct of space time. Whoa. I'm serious. Dude. Would the concept of consent exist? Because here's the thing. The problem was rape or any crime or any crime, right? Any kind of violent crime is like traumatizing somebody. You're hurting them, right? Right. But that only becomes apparent through consequence. So if you stop time and time doesn't exist and you fuck somebody, the effect is true. Well, that's not true because if you rape someone while they're sleeping, they don't realize it. No, no, no. They wake up and realize it. They wake up. They stop time. So time, so if there's no- But then how would you rape if there's no time? Yeah. If you can't say something occurred because it happened outside of the realm of occurrence at large, then there is no crime. Right. Yeah, but then would you just live out the rest of your life in the stops time? Because as soon as time resumes, then it's rape. No, because that didn't happen to them. I guess technically, Nick, you're right. So you could rape that way. Congratulations. No, no, no, no. What do you mean? And then cut through a scene of me storming out of a courthouse and everyone's cheering. They're reporters. They're taking pictures with me. Your arms raised like Rocky. The greatest scientist of all time. I've been working for 40 years in a lab. So you could rape people while time is stopped. You devoted your entire- You had one of the finest scientific minds. That's really a beautiful mind. That's what that movie's about. Nick, you truly have. The mind may be beautiful, but that ass. That's the parenthetical title of that movie. Goddamn. That's the sub title. Subheader. What is it? No. I'll tell you what, boys. I am excited to make some use of this Craig Masterjig. I've had my eye on it for a while now. I'm going to be cutting a lot of pocket holes and dowels in the next couple of weeks, folks. If you own the Craig out there and you're looking for some project ideas, follow me on YouTube. It's the official Daily Stormer account. Maybe every 100 videos or so I'll do a woodworking thing. But watch all of the videos. It's important you listen to what these guys have to say. I know genocide may seem like a scary word, but if you really think about it, it's kind of necessary. What's happening to us right now? Yeah, we're being white genocide. Oh man, I was really disappointed that the police shot another unarmed black guy today. Did you see that? On the day after the terrorist? Yeah, let me have one day. Where I get to be like, I told you so. I fucking knew it. And then that, you know what, it was a lady cop that did it. Of course. A lady cop. Yeah, she's like, I got to take one for the team. Yeah. I got to do this and make this happen so that we can go back to... I didn't even fucking realize, man, that's quite a shame what they're doing to black. I'm trying to remember his name. Terrence Howard keeps popping back in my head. Terrence Howard has a micro penis, by the way. Is that a fact? Yeah. What do you mean, the actor? Yeah, Terrence Howard. He has like a micro penis. No. Yes, he does, dude. What do you mean he does? How do you know that? You guys talk for a second. I'll pull it up on my phone. Okay. But there's no way that guy's got a fucking micro. He has this weird thing about... What's the math thing? Zero plus zero equals one? I have no idea what you're talking about. He has this weird thing where one times one is two. That's what it is. What do you mean he hasn't? He's like... He says a lot? He's just bad at math? What does that mean? He's really bad at math. No, but he's like very confidently bad at math. Okay. He's like, I have this theory. I'll look it up after Nick pulls up this guy's dick. Okay. You mean that thing, that contradiction in algebra where you can prove that one equals two? Was that what it is? I mean, maybe that's the thing they show you in junior high. Is that a real thing? Really? I don't remember. I remember when I took algebra, they showed you that one... Fucking nerd. You know fucking algebra? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, not anymore. Bitch. All right. I could see him. I guess he seems like the kind of guy... Oh, he's bad. I shouldn't say. He could be the kind of guy who only eats pussy. Yeah. No, in his divorce. Get this. In his divorce, he was, and this is just me, I'm staring at a picture of his dick right now while I'm telling you this. Show me. I will afterwards. So, in his divorce, he was saying that his wife was blackmailing him and saying that she was going to tell everyone about his tiny little dick in the divorce settlement. What do you mean? That was in the court documents. But then he did a naked scene in a movie. Look at this shit, dude. Adam, pass me that? No way. Yeah. Why would he agree to do a naked scene? No. Look at that, look at that. Are you sure this is real? That's real. Let me see. I got a bigger dick than Terrence Howard. They wouldn't give him a fake micro penis. No, but this could be photoshopped. It's not photoshopped. It's a scene in a fucking movie. I can't understand how small this dick is. Let me see it. But why would he agree to do it in a movie? I don't know. What? No. That's pretty cool. That's a pretty cool micro to pee. What the fuck? No. I guess now we know why it's so hard out here for a pimp. No way this is real. Folks said it's a reference to the movie Hustle and Flow, which came out in 2005. 2005. Was it? Very overrated movie. I thought it was okay. I thought it was kind of a piece of shit. You know what I want to watch again? Training Day. Terrence Howard believes one times one equals two. So he created his own language. If you believe the rules of basic arithmetic, Terrence Howard... I mean, you know, it's like not the biggest dick I've ever seen. No, that is a tiny, tiny dick. It's a bad angle. You can throw it to me. I got an Otterbox. It's a bad angle, but he's probably, you know... Damn, that is a pretty small dick though. Yeah. Poor guy. I mean, here. Look, in this one, all you can see is his balls. There's another one? Yeah. All you see is his balls. Oh my God. He's completely invisible. All right. This is not good... This is not good broadcast material. Well, when we do... We were all looking at that picture of Arthur Chew. People seemed to like it. Did they? I forgot we did that. Arthur Chew is a micro penis. Well, duh, of course he does. That's not news at all. Yeah. It would be weird if he had like a bigger than four inches dick. All right. After seeing his shoes, I love the idea of Arthur going to like, fuck a girl. And somehow he like, shoves the condom halfway in his ass. And he's got like, the wrapper jammed down his dick hole. He's like, okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do this. All right. This is what Terence Howard says about one times one. He said, how could it equal one? If one times one equals one, that means that two is of no value because one times itself has no effect. One times one equals two because the square root of four is two. So what's the square root of two should be one, but we're told it's two and that cannot be. That's that two isn't the square root of two. No, it's like, it's like one point, something weird. He's fucking stupid. He's got a little ass dick. Yeah. I'm glad. I'm glad they replaced him in Iron Man with maybe that's why maybe he's just thinking with his dick, folks, because it's small, his little ass dick, Nick's doing a thing like he's whispering. Yeah. Well, that does pick up. Oh, it does. Yeah. I didn't know that. People can tell there's an acoustic difference. I'm doing it now. You pieces of shit. Yeah. That's a, I feel like this makes things funnier if you do that. I've been doing this a lot actually recently. Yeah. This, like, like, uh, like you're trying to stop other people doing it. Yeah. It's a fun. Like your hand is blocking the sound from exactly. Yeah. Oh yeah. That's cool. This is also good radio. I feel like I've been on point tonight. You've been great. You've been good. Thanks guys. You've been really caring. I've been so depressed lately. So I needed that. Yeah. I'm thinking about getting into cheese. It's not a bad thing to get into. Like stinky stuff. Like French. I just, I'm thinking about, I really, I really was in the mood tonight for some cheddar and triskets. Okay. This podcast is brought to you by Rosemary and Olive Oil Triskets. The Triskets for, uh, not gay guys, the rest of the Triskets, you better be, you're gay. I love Rosemary and fucking. You know what I understand? Why Trump doesn't just say, like, look, if you don't vote for me, you're a faggot. Because the people that aren't going to vote for him that would still would fall for that. You know what I mean? You saw the jelly beans. That's the perfect way to solidify his base. Like vote for Trump or you're, I would love, imagine gay, imagine seeing fucking billboards that say that just like Trump or you're gay in major American cities is not completely out of the realm of possibility. This is the new dicks out for Harambe. Yeah. Vote for Trump or you're gay. Vote for Trump or you're gay. I think this could be something. Did you guys hear that when they arrested the terrorists that did the bomb today? He said, dicks out for Harambe. That was the last. Did he? Yeah, he said it. He said, I hate Brandon so much. He said, I was, uh, he said, he said, the person that inspired me the most to commit this act of terrorism is Brandon Gordell. I mean, he could have said that. The guy was a psychopath. He's not a real Muslim. Any Muslim that commits any kind of, uh, when he jumps a turnstile, you know, doesn't pay his taxes, they're no longer Muslim. That's true. In fact, the only real Muslim is the, is the guy from the night up. That actor. It's the only one guy who's a good boy. Yeah. He was a good boy. And Adnan. Also a good boy. No. No. Adnan did it. So he's Christian. Adnan's a bad boy. Yeah. Adnan's Christian now? Yeah. I didn't know that's how it worked. Christian by guilt. Adnan did it, by the way. I didn't, I never watched that. You didn't listen to cereal? I don't give a fuck about cereal, dude. Well, it's great, actually. It's like, it's actually, what got me in, I didn't listen to cereal season one is what got me in the podcast. I listened to it when I was moving once. What do you mean? That was fucking two years ago. Yeah. That's where the, that was the first podcast I listened to cereal. Yeah. That's weird. I was like, okay, maybe this isn't like such a stupid thing. You're like a fucking Midwestern mom. That's what they were saying. Like the first podcast, the podcast has been an industry for like, people were doing it for how long? Like 10 years. I listened to a handful of what the fucks, I never really cared for it. Yeah. You know, I'm really good. But you also hate Marin. What's that? You also hate Marin. Yeah. I didn't listen to Race Wars when I was on it. Yeah. I had probably been on like seven podcasts before I like actually got into listening to podcasts. Yeah. I can't listen to the ones that I'm on that's fucking weird. Yeah. No, it is weird. Who does that? I don't know. What kind of fucking psychopath does it? Little Dick Terrence Howard ass motherfucker. But yeah. So, no, cereal is great because there's one episode where like the whole, the whole the prosecution's case hinged on their like structure of like how, like their time frame of how like the crime went down. And there is a like 21 minute window where Adnan can't be accounted for and neither can like Heyman and like they just have to go based on like Adnan's story. And the prosecution says like, okay, this is what he did. He left the school. He, you know, met up with her here at Best Buy. Yeah, Best Buy choked her out in the car and then dumped her body in the woods and then went back in time for football practice or whatever. And that was, that was what happened in the 21 minutes. And so you're like halfway through a cereal and, you know, they cut to like Adnan on the prison phone. He's like, you know, I just don't understand how I could have, you know, ever had the time to do that. You know, I mean, it just doesn't make sense to me how I could do that. She's like, well, what did happen Adnan? And he's like, you know, I honestly don't remember, you know, that's his whole thing. He's like, I don't remember. And then she's like, that's what makes him so credible is that like, he doesn't have an alibi. And it's like, okay. And then so I don't disagree. I, you know, I don't either. I don't remember what I did yesterday. But there's this idea that like convicts don't fucking lie to people like they're not really good liars. Right. Well, no, convicts are, for the most part, pretty bad liars. A small percentage of them are sociopaths and they're incredible liars. Most of them aren't very good at lying. I think so. You do? They're pretty good. Yeah. I think any, any person that I've like met that has like spent like, you know, a decent amount of time in like prison, they're usually good at lying. They're usually liars. I would agree with that. Yeah. Well, he hadn't spent time in prison. He was just a. Yeah. He's a murderer in Syria. I guess he was anyhow. Yeah. So there's one episode where they like, she's like, so me and Dana decided to follow the prosecution's timeline and see how long it would take. And they like time it. And they're like, okay, we're leaving. They actually leave the school. They do everything that she said he did. And then they get to the phone booth where he makes the phone called it ends. And she's like, and time. And she looks at the watch and she's like, okay, 22 minutes and 30 seconds. It's like, it's almost like pretty much like, you know, it's like a minute off. And then they tell Adnan and he's like, well, that, hmm, okay, you know, but yeah, no, he definitely killed that girl. Do you think Steven Avery did it? Steven Avery absolutely did it. Look, any kind of thing, any kind of justice documentary is bullshit. They're all bullshit. Steven Avery, guilty, Adnan guilty, Robert Durst innocent. True. Yeah. He's 100% innocent. There's something about Robert Durst. I don't know what it is that Adnan just was not. I can't put my finger on it. Steven Avery kind of rose that joke. Oh, I guess. Yeah. But I like where you're going with it. Well, Robert Durst is Jewish. You could go that route. Yeah. I suppose. There you go. Well, then that's bad also though. Yeah, it is. No, it is good. Steven Avery is something different. I told you guys, right? And O.J. was going on, my father just went absolutely crazy about the trial like a lot of people. That's not very remarkable, but he did not believe O.J. Simpson killed his wife. He was like the only white man in America, and he was just sitting at home going absolutely nuts. No, it was pretty evenly divided. Like white people were like, yeah, he did it like rich white people didn't want to believe well. I just had my finger directly on the pulse of America back then when I was five years old. Yeah. No, I really understood the zeitgeist at the time. The people I talked to at work when I was five, no, you watch those reaction videos, watch the reaction videos like from the world star ones from the 30 for 30. No, no, watch the reaction videos from the 30 for 30, I didn't say the 30 for 30. It's in. That's insane. It's literally white people just weeping about Nicole and then like black people just going. Absolutely. Yeah. Like so excited. That dad is such a funny character. The guy that they got to play the dad in a TV show looked exactly. What about my son? Exactly like the real it was so funny. What's his name? Goldman. Yes. Dead son. Okay, guys. Well, it's our monster truck check in time now ready for the monster truck minute. Actually, we should probably take well, I don't want to. I've been enjoying not taking breaks because then I then I don't have to fucking find some gay bullshit to put in the middle of the show. Yeah, that's fine. Let's find out what we've done on a small caffeine world going out to dinner after this. I can't go to yes, I can just we'll grab something quick where I don't know we're going to a diner. I have my bike going to Danny's diner that Danny's Danny's delicious diner down on the block on decal. Is that place open on decal? I don't fucking know. I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm trying to fill time. You're both falling asleep. All right. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, guys. We did a podcast late last night and then I'd be up at seven this morning. Yeah, I got to go build a goddamn fence tomorrow. I'll be up at six a.m. Really why? I don't know. I told my online helper put a gate where Westchester no and Hell's Kitchen Hell's Kitchen. Yeah. Yeah. What kind of gate? Like a wrought iron gate? No, it's just like a stockade gate. It's like we're out. Yeah. It's in like it's behind the apartment. Oh, behind the apartment. No one has like a wooden front gate in New York. No, no, no. It's like where her garbage cans are. Yeah. It's all wrought out. Are you getting into iron work? That'd be cool. I want to learn how to weld, build a fucking robot, get those robot fights with my giant robot that I built. Hell yeah. Yeah. Get an angle grinder. I guess my new thing is just making sparks. That's the coolest shit, do you know what? Do you guys remember David Letterman had that woman that would fucking do sparks? Yeah, yeah. Remember that shit? Yeah. She would grind this shit on her pussy. Yeah, yeah. I remember beating off to that a couple times. Really? Yeah. Because you could see like a real high up near her pussy. She had like a real angled bikini bottom. A real, yeah. I don't remember that bit. The only one I remember is Will It Float. That's fucking. He did some great stuff. God damn it. He was the best person to do that very, very stupid job. Nah, dude, Jimmy Fallon. He's the best. Shut up. I love that everyone was mad that Fallon had Trump on. They're not mad that he had Trump on. They're mad that he like flirted with Trump. Didn't even ask him. Trump's a great guy. Shut up. He says we're all thinking, you know, he really, he, look, listen, he really understands people. Okay. In a way that other people don't. He's a blue collar billionaire. Yeah. You know. He's the blue collar comedy tour. He's all for those guys. Exactly. Exactly. Did you see Larry the cable guy on Fox and Friends? So good. I think we talked about this on another time. Look, Hillary Clinton is going to ruin the country. He went, yeah. Oh my god. We got to get her out. Done. Get her, get her finished. You got to get her done. Yeah. He went in character to a fucking man, Dan Whitney, you mean? Yeah. He was in and out of character. I don't even know. Have you ever seen Dan Whitney videos like before? Yeah. Of course. Yeah. It's just a regular guy. Mike Diesel used to pretend that he knew him before he was Larry the cable guy. That's awesome. Well, he was a Florida standup. No, he's like a Florida guy who called into a radio show. He would like call into radio shows as different characters and eventually the Larry the cable guy character was a hit. Get the fuck out of here. Jesus Christ. Yeah. I don't know. I don't think he had much of a career before that blue collar comedy tour thing because Jeff Fox where they blew them all up. Yeah. Ron White's the one that it's like cool to like. Ron White's the only one that was like actually any funny comic, too. Tater Salad. Yeah. That guy's real funny. Bill Engvall, baby. Bill Engvall, the Bill Engvall show. Yeah. Everyone gets Bill Engvall. When women pee, they look like they're waiting for a bus. Why are you watching women pee? Why are you supposed to look interesting while they pee, Bill? What the fuck is your point? Oh, fuck. Oh, you know what we didn't talk about? What we said we were going to talk about on the bonus is Irwin, dude. Oh, fuck. Yeah. Yeah, we should have a little Irwin. That's how it goes. That's a fucking good one. Yeah. I just mentioned Mike Diesel and I forgot completely about Irwin. Irwin. He changed it to. He did? Yeah. Why did you change your name to that? I guess he doesn't want people to know that he's Jewish. Yeah. Yeah. Well, Irwin and the way the guy looks. Irwin. Yeah. This guy looks like, if you've been following me on Twitter for a while, back when I was Eddie Cum, my avi was Irwin hanging off that swing set. Where did you find that? That's the greatest picture I've ever taken. That's such a fucking. He takes the best picture. He's awesome. I've seen him with him just sitting in a chair and at the back of a stage. He's morbidly obese. Morbidly fucking obese. He has a mustache. A mustache. He looks like, he's like, I look like Ron Jeremy and he does, but like, looking like Ron Jeremy isn't a good thing. Right? Ron Jeremy. He's a good looking guy. He has one good part in his body and it's not, it could be an ugly. Just some fucking guy that never fucks and just like works it at who knows where. Yeah. He ran into some fucking, he's a, he used to run open mics in DC. He ran the EJ's landing. Yeah. Kaleidoscope comedy. Kaleidoscope comedy. What the fuck name is that even? I don't know. Yeah. I feel bad with Irwin cause he's just like a guy that sucks at comedy. He's not like, right. And I used to be really fucking, I used to fucking bully the shit out of that man. And I was like 17 years old and he was 40. He did. He hosted the first open mic he ever did and he was like, what, how do you think I did? To like me and Jordan Owens and Jordan's like, yeah, just keep at it, man. I was like, honestly. And he was like, yeah, I was like, you have no business doing comedy. I was like, I know it's your first time, but like you're just really not fucking funny. That's hilarious. Like there's nothing in your person. You really said that to him? Yeah. I was mean as shit. That's incredible. I was like, there's nothing in your personality that resembles like a funny person. Yeah. I don't like, you don't have like the prerequisite, you know, a sense of humor to be a good comedian ever. There's so many people probably like that. I know. But I was like six, seven months in and I'm like, yeah, who's junior over here is first open mic because I also remember that was like, I think Jason Weems was just getting started. Yeah. He'd been doing comedy like one or two weeks and he did that open mic and he did like 20 minutes. And crushed. Yeah. And it was so funny. Crushed. Well, no one was there. No one was ever at that mic. I'm sure. But he was like incredible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Weems is fucking hilarious. Yeah. Irwin is. I feel bad telling. I can't. I don't know if I can. Oh, you got a real good one. Yeah. I don't know. Because I already said his name. I said his whole name. Yeah. It's pretty fucking damning story. Anyway, let's talk about another guy. Do you know any stories about a different guy? Oh, yeah. This guy, Irwin Dickfield. He sets a cousin. I forgot about this. This guy. Yeah. So, said Dickfield. That's a friend named Irwin Dickfield. And they're related to each other. What happened? What happened to Irwin Dickfield? Oh, yeah. So, Irwin Dickfield one time. Yeah. This other guy we know. He's like, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. This other guy we know. He is this fucking, this big idiot roommate. This guy, Chris, that was like, who never worked. He just was always on the couch in their apartment. Like, this guy was like 6'11\". And he would just take up the entire couch, just lay down and playing like, he's playing some like online, like Final Fantasy Online or something in the dark with the air conditioner set to like 50 degrees. Yeah. And he'd be like, what's going on kid? He'd say, he had this like weird accent. He'd be like, what's going on kid? How you doing kid? And he'd be like, Chris, what do you do? He's like, I sell beer for the Redskins. This is the job he said he had. At the stadium? Yeah. But he never left the apartment. So I don't think he was employed. We're watching the Redskins on TV right now, dude. Right now? No. I'm like, he says that. Oh. Oh yeah. Okay. It's on TV. You can't just fucking wake up to sell that bit at all. Sorry. What if he was like, what if he said this? So yeah, I guess they were at like a bar one night and that guy had been hitting on this woman that was like obviously a lesbian. Oh really? Yeah. And I heard this story from like three other people and it's about a fictional guy. Yeah. It's about this guy. This guy did Seth's cousin. So Chris, the roommate had been hitting on this fucking, this woman that was like clearly a lesbian at the end of the night, she like goes home to do lesbian shit. He's like, ah, struck out or whatever. And that fictional guy and his girlfriend are like, well, you can come have a threesome with us. I guess. Oh man, I don't know, I can't, I can't, you're in too deep dude. It's too late. It's too late. No, we gotta, we gotta switch. This one's gotta be the premium one. All right. This story is too fucking mean. I've told it to like maybe, and I didn't even know. I heard it like third hand, you know. It's too late. You tell it. You've heard the story. No, no, because it's already fucking gossip. It's not my story. Somebody told me. Stop it. I don't know if this is right, but so apparently this guy Erwin Dickfield invited me. It's this, uh, this giant mongoloid back to his home, uh, to have a threesome with him and his girlfriend and, uh, apparently Erwin Dickfield, uh, was just beating off while, uh, this man just savagely fucked his girlfriend. Yeah, I guess somebody said he couldn't get it up or something. Yeah, he just, he couldn't get it up. He was just diddling himself. He was just like fingering, rubbing his penis like it was a clit while a man fucked his girlfriend. That's a well-known kink though, like the cuckold thing, yeah, the fuck my wife thing. Yeah. Yeah, well, I mean, this is something that, this is something that Erwin, that Dickfield is into. I feel so bad. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to bleep his last name. Okay. That's good. Yeah. The anti-Semitic come town fans account was going to find him though, I'm sure. Yeah. He found Stav's office. Yeah. I don't know how he did that. You like, you didn't even see, yeah, but he didn't even say it. Like he was like, yeah, I mentioned like briefly in passing and he somehow found it. That's hilarious. Yeah. Good for him. And at Stav comedy, at Nick Mullen, at fucky kikes, not nose, piece of shit. Oh man, that is, how many of our fans do you think are just anti-Semitic or like alt right? A lot of them, cause a lot of them come over from when me and Stav did the Akumia. Oh, I guess you guys see the spike after that. Yeah, of course. I mean, I stayed heavy promoting this shit on all of the bad boy networks. Yeah. I promoted on. They've been waiting for a Puerto Rican Ralsing podcast. Yeah, the Puerto Ralsing is back. We haven't been hitting that as hard, but this is the number one MMA podcast in New York. When Lance Colt fights, uh, Dirk Benson next week at UFC 82. I can't wait. He's going to choke them out. Dirk, we're talking real, real, real naked chokes. We're talking arm bars. Kemosabes. Kymora. Kemosabes. Fucking. Reverse cowgirl. Adult karate, dude. Reverse cowgirls. What if that's how you won? Yeah. That's a submission miss. Yo, there's this guy. He's got a black belt. Okay. Fifth degree. And he's, you know, full contact. We're talking big, big time, baby. And I cannot wait to see that fight. You ready here for her? Yeah. We're actually on the premium content. We're starting a new MMA podcast called Hammer Fisting. Yeah. So you're going to really want to check that out. Oh, how can I fuck with Nick Mullin? My friend. I'm thinking about punching him in the fucking head. Is that a good prank? Yeah. That's a real, that's a good prank. You can't troll me. Nobody trolls me. Lewis. Uh, Jay Gomez. Who's that? Uh, you mean Lewis Dickfield? Yeah. Lewis Dickfield, go, Lewis D. Gomez, Lewis Dickfield, Gomez. Lewis D. Gomez. There should just be a town called Dickfield or Dicktown. Dicktown. Dicktown is the podcast. Yeah. Dicktown is the alternate universe. Did you listen to Seth at his own podcast? I heard it, man. I can't believe he broke into the Anthony Kumi studio. Yeah. Yeah. The podcast. Who is that, uh, the Chinese? He's got a great co-host there. I don't know. I think that guy died. I think, uh, I heard from somebody else. I mean, I don't know the plan, but I think Seth's just going to have a different POC guest. Oh boy. Every week. Easy. Oh, well, you know, hopefully, well, that's fine if that's what he plans to do, but I mean, we're going to lock up the equipment real tight. So, I don't know if we can get another one, but maybe his cousin Ralph might be able to help him out. Yeah, I think Ralph might actually come by. He's done a couple of beanies. Yeah. I think. Ralph might swing by, have a couple. Or maybe his, maybe his friend, uh, you know, Erwin Dickfield. Erwin, Erwin and Ralph should hang out. I think that would be a lot of fun. Oh boy. Yeah. Why does this fucking gay Jewish clown out here? Yeah. Who got this fucking? You know, I look kind of like Ron Jeremy. Yeah. Let me see your dick then. Yeah. You fucking talk her like you. Erwin was like, when Erwin was on show posters and it was like six black guys. Yeah. I don't know how he got in on that click, but like, it was just always like, you know, like, did you see that video? James the comedian. Yeah. Yeah. Big Fred. I used to love all those guys. All those like PG County comics. Yeah. The fight. The fight video is the funniest fucking shit. Rollo posted a fight at an open mic in like PG County somewhere. It was, no, that was, that was Erwin host that. Yeah. It was some like Temple Hills open mic and it's a guy who's like Lamarcus way too violent Jackson. Yeah. The entertainer. The entertainer. Yeah. They've been stealing Scott Joplin's name for 80 years. Some guy is something too funny. Yeah. Too funny, too business hilarious entertainer. That's what I'm saying. That's the LLC. That's the LLC. I love that shit on every way. Real dark black entertainment. Super, super dark black guy entertainment. LLC. Incorporated trademark sign. International executive black guy. Or it's just N and larious, but then the S is a dollar sign. And larious entertainment presents two funny Tuesdays. No, what are you? Two larious Tuesdays. Two larious Tuesdays. Erwin Lorke. Tom Mars was just on one of those shows. Somebody sent me the poster. It's him and like, yeah, even like the middle of Pennsylvania on some like urban show. And it's him and like three middle-aged black women comics. That's awesome. They'll let those guys keep working. Yeah. The Erwin and the toms can like keep getting. I mean, I was, I fucking love Lawrence. Lawrence is so fun. Lawrence owns is funny. I mean, you know, he's whatever. He's not. He cracks me up dude. I was watching it. I was watching a Lawrence owns video the other day where he's like doing that thing about how he's like, he's got glasses so he can't be a thug. And he's just fucking like going up to the mic stand or cross on. He's like, who's more fucking I'm supposed to kill? Is this him right here? Shit. There he is. Fucking. He's just a goofball. Yeah. But yeah. No, he's great. He's really funny. Also really funny. He's a good performer. Really good stuff about gay people. Yeah. Oh yeah. You know, the bit immediately after that and that video is like, shit, half of you probably know a faggot. One time I did a Tony Wood Show at climate. Tony is fucking hilarious. Yeah. Tony's a good guy. Climate. With a K. Yeah. Climate. Climat lounge. Yeah. Climat. So I went there. I saw Tony the night before. Climat's the night. We drank some grand marnier. And there's this guy, David, that was on the real world. One of the early seasons. He was a black guy. David's something. And he was DC comic, I guess. It was like Martin Lawrence. And back in the day, he was DC comic. And his sister was there. I guess he was hanging out at the show. I guess Tony knew him. And his sister was there. He was just completely black out, heckling every single person on stage. Jesus. Tony gets in late. Of course. The show's already off the rails. Of course. And I was about to go up next. I'm like, I'm just going in the lion's den. This woman's going to destroy me. And there's this guy that went up before me. His name is Detroit Boat. Do you ever run across that guy? What the fuck? Come on, man. I swear to God, this guy's name is Detroit. Yeah, my name is Caprice Classic. Detroit is known for cars, too. It's not necessarily like a nautical type of vibe, though. He's on Lake Michigan. So he's trying to do his acts. She's interrupting him. And he's like, is someone going to tell this bitch to shut up? She stands up as soon as he says bitch. And she just smacks him across the face. I was there the night that Detroit Boat got smacked across the face by the sister of a guy that was on Real World 2 Los Angeles. What was that? Yeah, all those guys used to come hang out. These threw Ian Sammons open mic. I remember the guy, I forget his name, Chris something. He was the host of Rap City. No, I know who you're talking about. Chris Thomas, yeah. Rap City, the basement was the guy that worked at the Wizards games. Remember? Well, Chris Thomas had a bunch of credits to whatever. Chris Thomas was the original host of Rap City. I don't remember, but I know Chris had a ton of credits. Big Tigger, right? Big Tigger. He was the original host of Rap City. So maybe it was like season one or something. But yeah, he was at an open mic one time. And there was this one guy losing his mind. And he's like, how are you all not going crazy? Do you not know who this is? And he's like, this was the original host of Rap City. And he was like, okay. You know, he was famous as shit. And he just, he would come and just like, if you got in a corner with him, dude, if it was you and him one on one, he just wouldn't stop telling you about how he used to be famous. Yeah. It was just like, he would not stop talking about it. That's the saddest shit, dude. And he would be doing his like Arsenio Hall impression or something. Like he would just be doing very dated impressions and shit like that. And like up until like two years ago. Yeah. Which I don't know. It's pretty sad. Yep. That's depressing. It's a shitty world to live in. Comedy sucks. People burn out. That's what it has to do with us, dude. That podcast is going to keep growing. There's actually a new feature on Patreon where you're not allowed to delete your pledge. Yeah. So, guess what? We have your social security information. You don't like this episode? Did anyone delete their pledge because the first bonus was bad? Oh yeah. A bunch of them. Really? No. I just want to make you feel bad. Why did you say that? Oh, fuck. I just threw up in my mouth a little bit. Nice, man. Nice, dude. Well, we got to have one puke. That's how we know. That's our time to end the show. That is a good end. Yeah. The cat puking was the best. The cat pukes. Nick pukes. No, I think I got an ulcer or something. I don't know. Probably. But yeah, that's been an hour and eight minutes. So, we're fucking done, I guess. Bye, guys.",

        "transcript_text": " B-S-T-A-C-O-L-T-S! Hello! Hello. Hi everyone. Hi, welcome to Come Town. WCUM. Come Town Radio. WCUM. The home of, I don't know. WCUM. I don't know what that place was. It's like, it's like how Cosby impressions sort of evolved over the years. So then when you get to like the family guy Cosby impression, it's so far removed from actual Cosby. Right. It's an impression. Well the kids, they go like listen to the jazz music and it goes zoop zoop zoop. Ooh, I used to, there was a man that sold Kodak film. That was like a family guy then. But we were just talking about how Brandon didn't really talk much on the podcast last time. Yeah, fuck Brandon. Which is good because fuck him but you can check him out on Chapo Trap House. He was their guest this week. Yeah, political analysis from, from Brandon. One of the most woke intellectuals, public intellectuals, like a Norman Mailer type. More like Norman Gailer. Thank you. Hormone Gailer. Hormone Gailer. Oh, that's good. Yeah, if you guys followed Norman Wilkerson on Twitter, please call him Hormone Wilkerson from now on. Glad we thought that. And tell him taxes are too low. Yeah. So we gotta cover this. I already told Adam I'm doing this. Oh, I don't know about this. This is used to me. I didn't consent. You don't have to fucking consent. Let me know. So basically, about rape again. No. So we're all, we're all aware of the character, or not character, the guy who's come on the show who died tragically, slipping on a banana peel. Okay. Who stopped mentioning and like, out of reverence for the dead. Yeah, right. Because he passed away. So there's this other guy, Seth Cockfield, who was offended by the character. And that's why, you know, I mean, it's not why, but it was sort of a coincidence that Seth had a meltdown about it. And then Seth Cockfield died and we stopped allowing Seth Dickfield to bully Seth Cockfield via the magic of theater. Right, right, right. Oh, I didn't get it. Seth, oh, so Dickfield was bullying Cockfield. Yeah, it wasn't me. I see. Okay. It was the guy. It was the human, the real human being who was at Dickfield. You know, my favorite movie of all time is Who Framed Roger Rabbit. And Roger Rabbit is chained to Eddie Valiant, their handcuffed together for about an hour. Yeah. And then they're in that back room in the bar. And Eddie finally, Eddie finds a hacksaw and he starts hacking through the handcuffs. And while he's doing that, Roger Rabbit just slips out of the handcuffs and he like starts watching him. Oh yeah. And he says, you mean to tell me you could have taken those off at any time? And he goes, no, only when it was funny. And I sort of lived by that code that anything can be justified if it's funny. So I'm not responsible for hurting Seth's feelings. And he's a bad guy. But what do you mean? I thought you said you had nothing against him. I don't have anything against him. I mean, I'm just saying objectively, he's a bad guy. God, that's even better. Yeah. He's claiming it's objective. But there's like a scientific unit of measurement. It's not that he's petty and anyone who annoys him a little bit, he goes way too hard at them. Who me? Yeah. Who else have I gone way too hard at? Anyone that annoys you on the Internet. I feel like on the Internet you like to just... No, there's people I like to make fun of. I think Seth's like a great character and he just doesn't realize that. Anyhow, the point is I wouldn't bring him up, but Seth rejoined Facebook to complain about me and clear the air. And I think, you know, it's... No, hold on. Adam shaking his head in protest. He posted this because he... And I agree with him. I have been mean to him. So I think it's like really fair that I let people who was only exposure to Seth hear what Seth has to say in his own character, in his own defense. So Seth posted this. Yeah, don't do... You're definitely not going to do the voice. What do you mean? Well, it's in Seth's words. Okay. Do the voice. Seth wrote... Hi, I'm not back. I just wanted to share this and then bounce back into the ether sometime before Monday. This tweet is an old tweet of mine, which I tweeted in a rage one day in the spring of 2015, right around noon, most probably after reading about yet another atrocity portrayed by some white cop, a politician, a rapist. Adam, you look this please. If it's really going to bother you that much, I'll tell you, there's seven more paragraphs. Just continue. We're only halfway through the first one. We already started. There's no going back. Well, if you don't want to be a part of this, I guess, if you're such good friends with Seth, you don't want me to just let Seth speak for himself here. This is a recording you're playing, right, of Seth reading his post. Yeah, play the recording. He went live on Facebook Live. Finish the video. I don't know. Well, if you're going to have a problem. Continue. No, you already said, I guess, I guess I'm just a big bully. I guess everybody just thinks I'm just a fucking asshole because I'm trying to let Seth defend himself to the come town. You know what? You're right. Let Seth finish. You're right. You're right. We're being the bullies. We're trying to stifle Seth's voice. Let's hear what he had to say. Anyhow, he says this is a tweet he tweeted in a rage after an atrocity portrayed by White Cop or politician or rapist. The tweet got no likes or retweets at the time, which was fine. I didn't expect it to. I just wanted to get it off my chest. If that makes you feel uncomfortable, I get that and I'm happy to discuss it. And then he's included the tweet, which was terrible. The tweet is, here's Seth, and he says, White people will one day go extinct and I cannot wait. New power structure, please. He wants himself to go extinct. Well, anyhow. That's the tweet he included. What do you mean you can't wait? You are white. Well, hold on. He explains it further. Then he says, earlier this summer, a certain comedian popular on Twitter whom I will refer to as X, which is me. That's cool. Nicholas X. Yeah. Yeah, it's cool. I love that. That's a cool nickname. Thank you, Seth. That's why you don't understand nicknames. X is a tight nickname for you. It's nowhere near as good as Seth Dickfield, though. Dickfield's great. If he was earlier this summer, a certain comedian popular on Twitter who I will refer to as Nick Dickface, I would have laughed. That would have been funny. That was a blown opportunity. He gave you instead a really cool punk rock name, Dick Cuntlin. As X? Well, punk rock names are all like... Your first name is literally one letter. David Murder, like Jonathan Trash. Yeah. Like Garmin. Like Johnny Rotten. Mike Snot fucking Pussy. I'm an art forebend. I'm Johnny Snot ass. I'm Johnny Pustaint. Yeah. So, okay. So, earlier this summer... Your first name is literally one letter away from Dick. Yeah, you know. Like, you can call me Dick Muller. They've been funny. Dick Muller, yeah. Well, it would have been funnier if he called me like Nick Dickface or Nick Dickfag. Yeah, yeah. You just didn't put any effort into it. Of course. With the Cockfield thing. Nick Muldick would have been funny. Yeah, yeah. That would have been funny. But he went with X. So, sorry. Now I'm an X-man. Now I'm a fucking mutant. Professor X. The only white guy that looks good bald and handicapped. That's true. That's a good combo. Okay. Earlier this summer, a certain comedian popular on Twitter, who I refer to as X, someone whom I'm not... I don't... Is that... That's not... Whom is possessive, right? No. Subjective. Yeah. Not the subject of the sentence. Someone... But this isn't correct usage. Someone whom I'm not amicable with in the least? I don't think it's right. Someone who, yeah. I don't know. Someone who... Yeah, because you are the subject of the sentence. I don't fucking know, dude. I'm dumb also. Thought it'd be funny to create a character based on me for his podcast. This was completely unprovoked. The character is a weak, submissive, social justice warrior type who overuses words like woke and is generally obsessed with political correctness. The character's name is Seth Dickfield. Which... Side note, again, Seth is a real... Seth Dickfield is a real person. It's pretty insensitive to this guy who died. Yeah, we've all seen him. We've all looked at... Actually, I don't know. Have I been the right person? And honestly, Seth, for you to say that Seth Dickfield isn't real, considering he died at Auschwitz in a way that kind of makes you a holocaust tonight. So, Seth Cockfield, holocaust tonight. Jesus. Alright, getting back to the note. Seriously, he's not even trying to hide the fact... He's not even trying to hide the fact that the character is based on me. It's fucking weird to say the least. I haven't talked to this dude in over a year. This is the best part of the whole thing. How much thing? Last time I talked to him, he was at an open mic where he got upset with me because I wouldn't budge on my... I don't like the N-word and don't think white people should ever say it, Stan. I'm not mad because he thought his logic was sounded out of here. That is a hilarious... Wait, that didn't happen. That didn't fucking happen. I wouldn't argue with Seth about... That is the best. That he's like, last time I talked to him... Sorry, I don't like the N-word. He was stomping his feet and demanding to use the N-word in an open mic. Let me share it! Let me share it! Let me say it, Seth. I'm anti-rape and anti-Edward and I'm never changing that. Dude, the idea of just wanting to say the N-word... A person that would argue at length that they should say it but wouldn't say it. To be that stupid. Did I'm arguing with Seth? And that did not happen. Seth, of course not. He made it up. It absolutely didn't happen. The last argument I got in... He was stopping you from saying the N-word. I bravely stopped. Oh my god. What a fucking hero. Well, X wanted to show his followers that his character was based on a real person. So he scoured my actual Twitter feed for anything that might resemble his Seth Dickfield character. And he found one, the one I've uploaded here. He tweeted it and his followers went ape shit. I tweeted it without context. I just retweeted you saying a thing. You were doing it. That's what I was doing. You knew that was very funny. I knew it was fucking funny. People are going to laugh at him for being this much of a fucking idiot. But I didn't need to be like, you know, hey bully this guy, you're here this is why this is dumb. It stays at face value. It really does. It's a fucking dumb thing to write. So the tweet immediately started making the rounds with the most depressing parts of Twitter. Oh god. I guess the least depressing part of Twitter is tweeting Talib Kuali all day long. Don't let them get you Talib. That's the least depressing part. Talib very, very for women's rights. He really wants women to have breath control. The worst people in the world relish that X's character was based on someone so real and so liberal. And so they made it their business to keep a stream of daily hatred popping up in my notifications. It has been shared more times than I can count. It's like, well, that's the thing about Twitter, Seth. It tells you exactly how many times you can share. Seth can count to 13. It's been shared more times than I'm capable of reading a number off a screen. So basically I'm semi-famous in the Breitbart world for believing that white supremacy is real should be dismantled and meaning it. That's not what you said. You said white people should go extinct. And then the response from the majority of the people who responded to that tweet was like, doesn't this guy know he's white? That's why it's funny. That's the funniest thing. That's why it's funny. It's a white person saying white people should go extinct. No, but you can't understand the fact that people agree with you that there's racism. There's plenty of racism. You're a fucking laughing stock. I don't want to die. That's my biggest problem. I would go extinct under that. Because of my tweet, I must be a cuckold or gay or both. You're a gay cuckold. You brought the accent back. No one's fucking your husband. No matter what I am, they really want me to kill myself. Jesus Christ. The thing is they are telling him to kill himself, but it's in the context of him saying white people should go extinct. Speed it up. Yeah, people are like, can we start with you? Yeah, that's funny. Although I'm sure horrific parts of the internet did get a hold of that. It's Gavin McKinnis retweeted it. One of the worst. Yeah, so he spread it to the shitheads. Now it's the only tweet of mine being passed around exclusively by angry white supremacists. I love that through all of this, he's sort of kind of angry that he didn't go viral under his own terms. Yeah. What he really wanted to go viral for is people being a woke hero. This white guy that wants to die would a fucking hero. That's how he thought it would be. You showed him. Exclusively by angry white supremacists, I refuse to refer to them as alt-right, as I see the entire right-wing world as one big happy exclusive family with some uncles and cousins and a little more vocal and honest than the others. And also, by the way, Seth is an admitted former white supremacist. I don't know if you remember. Yeah, I remember. I read that post. Yeah, he had a post on Facebook like a year and a half ago that was like, listen up gang, I used to be a white supremacist. I read a bunch of racist literature. What? Like Nazi. Seth was like an actual Nazi at one point. Shut the fuck up. The point of it was to say that like you can change and you can get woe. You can change. Yeah, yeah. That was like the point of the post. Yeah, Seth, you know a lot of us didn't have to go through that process. Yeah. You know. No, I mean, that's crazy though. Is that real or was he like doing it up? I mean, I think that is real. You don't think it's real? No, I think it's real. And also in like 2007, like a total libertarian and like fuck you if you don't if you can't make what switched him is the idea that he should get health care for free. It was all about initially him getting shit for free, you know, about how he deserves things for free. And that's what brought him over into being a progressive. And then also he has to be cool. Like he can't like be interpreted as being cool. And Barack Obama was very cool to him. So he had to like Barack Obama. Young Barack Obama. Yeah. I'm all foreign. The worst part about this is that I can't even tweet anymore. I didn't really tweet that much beforehand. But now anytime I log in, it's 50 more notifications from the past week. Pure hatred. Not to mention X is still to this day using the character and retweeting shit with my actual face on it, which I wasn't. I haven't fucking mentioned like done anything with that Dickfield shit since he had that fucking meltdown because I felt bad. Like I have numerous times in the past 10 years that I've known Seth like feel felt bad when he says something moronic and shitty like specifically to elevate himself over people who hold the opinions that he had six months ago. Yeah. That's why it's so subject to ridicule. Yeah. And doing it as an elite. Right. He sees a fucking elitist prick and I'll like make fun of him for, you know, framing something in the context. If here's me being better than somebody and suddenly as soon as like he gets called out on that behavior, he's like, I'm a victim. Everyone's hurting me. This guy is such an asshole. It's completely unprovoked. And it's like, oh, was it provoked when you transcribed two paragraphs of that guy's personal conversation in that coffee shop, you know, to show everyone how much you love the family. But he didn't know that guy's actual. I mean, yeah. Sure. I understand what I'm doing. We truly are bullying. What? Yeah. I am bullying. There's no way around that. It's absolutely bullying. Yes. But it's also like, you know, I'm not wrong. That is the thing. If you are right, it doesn't matter what the fucking like, especially you do not give a shit whatsoever. And that's why we go back to the good words of Roger Rabbit. Only if it's funny. Only if it's funny. Yeah. If it's funny. And then Roger Rabbit broke Nick's brain. Yeah. He closes by saying, in other news, I'm back in school. I'm a college freshman. I love it. Other than that, all that Twitter shit I can safely say in general, life is good. So things are looking up for Seth. And I'm happy. I'm glad for him that he's in school. Because, I mean, honestly, 15 years of standup comedy and you're still bombing it open, Mike. This is Christ, Nick. See, this is the Mullen special right here. It did happen. After just shitting on him for something that he sent the seasoning on. You semi had a point, right? Still mean. But you had a good, then you just took the gratuitous, kick him while he's down. Fucking big. Yeah. He threats on college, you fucking. Anyway. He's making his life better. I'm like happy for him. Good man. I'm happy for him. You can see the expression on Nick's face, everyone. He's actually sucking Adam's dick right now. It's weird. He's been talking with Adam's dick in his mouth the whole time. The shitty part about all of it is, like, Seth is such a fucking great character and he doesn't understand what makes him funny, you know? Like, people, like, thought the dick field thing was funny because it's just Seth. He was a little heightened. Yeah. It's a version of Seth. Yeah. And if he could harness that, he could do great, you know? No, he can't. Yeah, he can't. He can't because he has no say in it. That's why it's funny. Yeah. That's just who he is, you know? And it's not a bit, you know? The character is funny because it's a bit because you're explaining. And it's not only funny because of Seth. It's funny because there are, especially with the election right now, a ton of people popping up that are like, you know, self-described woke, you know? I am woke. It's like I'm sleeping. Mark Ruffalo had some awful tweet. I saw it. Who was it? Getting woke to the trans experience. I'm getting woke to the trans experience. Yikes. More like Mark Dickifalo. Dickifalo? You want to start, Mark? Mark Dickifalo? Yeah. So, you know, so Seth on that thread got into, like, an argument with some guy. And here, somebody said, that's the thing I love about all this is people just immediately start sending me screen caps of, like, all this shit. And so somebody commented. You've infiltrated his Facebook, dude. I don't ask people to send me this shit. Like, fucking immediately, people start texting me and send me to me. Yeah. But, uh, yeah. Wow, Nick, it's just so accidental. What do you mean it's so accidental? How would I know? You block me on everything. There's no reason. I have, like, four different people that'll, like, you know, text me when he's going on. Seth's back. Yeah. Yeah. And he goes, so this is this guy that commented on that. What he's saying is that he's not really back on Facebook to belly ache yet again. Can't you tell? I'm not trying to be a jerk here, Seth. We only knew each other briefly in high school. Oh, man. I don't really know you that well. I just have to say you seem to get a joy out of complaining whenever you're on Facebook about anyone who doesn't lean 100% left in their thinking. You make me want to check out this Nick Mullen guy's spoof of you at this point. Again, not trying to be mean, but you're kind of pushy with your opinions. After saying that, if you feel like unfriending me, then so be it. And so Seth screen-capped that and then posted it as another status. Oh, guys, they're just commenting back. Well, on the status, he writes, TFW, you know, that face when, you're not trying to be a jerk, but you're nailing it, though. So it's like, hey. No. So now you're using AAVE. Now you're going full Wardell. Yeah. You've got to be black when you own the guy. And then that Seth eventually did block that guy. Jesus. And then that guy messaged me and he goes, you don't know me, but I went to high school with Seth Cockfield and he just unfriended me because I called him out on some of his whiny, pushy, leftist bullshit. Where can I check out this character you created about him? I would love a good laugh over this. This is incredible. Seth is getting us listeners. Yeah, I've never seen some. That's hilarious. Getting owned by just a guy who barely knew you and he's like, look, man, we don't really know each other. I'm the closest to an objective observer here. And I got to say, and he was even kind of like, well, let's talk about it. And what's funny is Seth was even like, I'm happy to talk about my tweet with you, but not about your fucking objections to how I'm behaving. I won't talk about that. No, Seth is just like constantly stepping on rakes and having them smash in his face. That was really good. Oh, yeah. I mean, it's just, it's too fucking funny. It's too perfect. And I know like, you guys are probably uncomfortable with, you know, having to bring that up. But like, look, this is it. I'm never going to fucking mention him again. Seth, like, I'm sure somebody will tell you about this. Like, it's done. I wouldn't have said anything if you hadn't posted nine paragraphs about it. And yeah, it's like, I mean, Seth also has to know you. He knows you. He's known you for 10 years. He had to know that that's like, definitely going to get your peak, your interest. I mean, the guy messaging him was so good. Yeah. Like even if no one was like keeping you keeping tabs on this for you, just one of his like friends blocking him messaging you is hilarious. I mean, it's gotta suck. Somebody fucking making fun of you and you can't control the, you know, any of the narrative around it. I would be pissed off if somebody had like, but you know, I also think it would, I think it would have been funny if somebody like did a fucking character based on you. And nailed it so well. And yeah, and they did it. I'd be like, all right, you know, I did a character based on you once. What was the name? Dick. I have a really good character. Yeah. It's called. No, no, it's called. I get on Wardell all the time. He's our friend. And you know what? I was friends with Seth. Me and him used to hang out, but he would, he would hang out with him. He would constantly talk shit on people. And then as soon as he found out anyone was criticizing him in any way, shape or form, you'd have a fucking meltdown, like a literal meltdown, storming out and shit. That's probably funny. Whatever. I don't care. Guys, you really stepped on my really good character. Oh, what's your character? It's called Gay Christopher Walken. Do it. I'm gay. That's good. Thank you. Yeah, that's good. You know, the Sicilians are the best liars. Two mice. Two men. Can I offer you? Fall into a vat of cream. Two men. And they fuck each other. And it becomes blood. I've had this pleasurable gold watch shoved up my ass until I come. Your father forgot. Oh, now I'm just doing a Jewish guy. Your father forgot it in my ass. That is a hard character. That's like the next level with impressions. Like if you can do an impression, but then like, you know, so like, you know, everybody loves Robert De Niro. One of me was deaf. Dude, deaf mom of the Niro. Hey, me. Just fusing to ham-fisted ass. Stare at the end. Me. Deaf mom of the Niro. You talking to me? I really, I can't hear you. You're gonna have to explain if you're talking to me or not. I can't tell. I'm even more deaf, Robert De Niro. Seriously, are you talking to me? Jesus Christ. Serious. Serious. Yeah. Or like, ooh, ooh, it's me, Robin Williams, but I'm- Still alive. Yeah, I'm dead. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. I have so much hair on my knuckles. Have you seen that dude's body hair, Robert- Robert Williams? Yeah. Insane. That's why he killed himself. Yeah, that's true. The Nair bills were getting too high. Yeah. He's just wearing a sweater, just all year long. So the West Indian Day Parade is today, which, shout out to any West Indian folks we got out there. Of course, our big West Indian listener. I'm a big fan. What's your favorite one? My favorite West Indies? Barbados. Barbados, me too. Yeah. Rihanna, Riri. Yeah. Guys, I don't know about you, but I would have sex with Rihanna. I thought about it the other day. I think I would. I think I'd have sex with- Nick? Yeah, I wouldn't. Why? I mean, because you guys already fucked her. That's gross. Yeah, I fucked her first. Once you fucked a woman, she's ruined forever. Yeah, yeah, this one fuck. Each woman is good for one fuck. And after that, she said, no good. You gotta kill them. They go in the trash compactor. That's where you put them. Oh, we should talk about this jazz age festival guy, because we were complaining about that. What's going on? They said New York Times had some article about this asshole that lives in Red Hook. Yeah, it was in the style section, I believe. He runs this thing called the Jazz Age Festival on Governors Island, which is fine. You can like jazz or whatever, and maybe for your performance, you dress up like a 20s guy. Yeah, yeah. But it has to extend to everything for him, which by the way, I feel like half the shit, everything in like the New York Times like real estate blog, that's all trolling. Oh, yeah. That's not serious, because every one of those is like, my name, Kayla's like parents only have a budget for her of $80 million a month for her perfect apartment. So she's going to have to make some compromises. Unfortunately, the toilet wasn't made out of pure crystal. And sometimes she could hear taxis honking in the Fifth Avenue Palace that her parents bought for her. Well, she takes classes at NYU on pretending she has it hard. Oh, fuck. I have to shop. Oh, my God. I have to shop. I have to shop. Maybe we're laughing about that one day. I need to shop. Rich Fifth Avenue women that are like fucking exhausted from shopping all day. I've had the worst day. I have been shopping all day. Oh, yeah. Their names are... We already did that, Joe. We talked about it. Madison Square Garden and Chelsea Peers and their Korean friend. That's right. Kim Park Slope. Yeah. Fuck. What's he doing? So this jazz thing is just like being insufferable. The article was about like this guy lives in 2016, but he's 1920s. Yeah. He's like, yeah, I'm 1920s. He's like, basically, I love the, you know, just everything about that era. It's like the 1920s. So he pulls his pants up too fucking high and does his socks. And as a thing, no Velcro. Like a mustache or whatever. And he's like, yeah, I don't even own a TV. And then his girlfriend's like, yeah, we just watched movies on my laptop, which is like... It's an even more new technology. So thank you, Twitter. Yeah. But they only watch movies from the 20s, I'm sure. Which that's got to be so fucking entertaining. You know, I tried watching, like I got a list of... I wanted to work through and watch every movie that's ever won Best Picture. Right. And I was looking at basically every movie before 1945 was like, you know, like some guy... It's a German that tap dances. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. We got to put on makeup and stay dramatically at each other to stop Hitler. You could never even fuck. Yeah. Get that cat out of there. Fuck out of here, you cat. Piece of shit. Don't throw up either. Yeah. I guess we should probably... What? I feel like that's not a worthwhile pursuit. What? Watching every Best Picture? Some of them are not. Some of them are so bad. Movies weren't good until like 10 years ago. Well, that's what you got to find. Even Best Pictures aren't good. Crash was the worst thing I've ever fucking seen in my life. That made me so upset. Driving Miss Daisy? It's not like that good of a movie. Oh, that shit sucks. Yeah, no, it's like... Gladiator's the only good one that's ever won Best Picture. My job ended. Actually, I saw it recently. Piece of shit. No, I'm kidding. Of course, didn't deserve Best Picture, but it was fun to watch. Gladiator wasn't bad. I remember it was my favorite movie at like 15. Oh, really? Yeah, that's exactly what my favorite movie was. I went with my dad. When I was like 13, my favorite movie was Men of Honor. Hell yeah. Oh, the one with... Scuba diving. Scuba, scuba, scuba, scuba, scuba, scuba, scuba, scuba, scuba, scuba, scuba. I remember watching Boondock Saints when I was like 12 and being like, That was the best fucking thing I've ever seen in my life. I hate it. I always hated Boondock Saints. No, dude, it caught me beautifully. Well, I hated Boondock Saints because I loved Goodfellas and then someone was like, I love Goodfellas. You'll love Boondock Saints. And I watch it. I'm like, this is stupid as shit. Dude, I fucking loved it. I was like, damn, they know every language. Have you ever seen Overnight? No. The documentary about the guy that made Boondock Saints? No. It's amazing. Really? He's this like egomaniac Boston fucking bartender. He's like, yeah, I'm from Boston. You know, I wrote a movie and I wrote it because it's fucking real. You know, Boston style. That was when they like, they made a ton of those movies. Yeah. So his initial script was like, it got passed around Hollywood and people liked it a lot. And I think it was like Miramax had, like Harvey Weinstein had it and he liked it personally. And then they tried to get like De Niro in on it. They tried to get all these big names, but the guy who wrote it was such a difficult piece of shit to work with that he sabotaged like everything. And like eventually it got produced and then he took some shitty deal where he just got like a payout and like didn't make anything off distribution. Oh really? So he ended up making like no money off the fucking movie. Also it was supposed to come out on 9-11. Oh. And they like had to postpone. Yeah. I haven't seen Overnight in a while, so I forget all the details, but yeah. Oh, you're talking about Overnight? No. No, you're talking about Boondock Saints. Overnight is a documentary about the guy. If he had just gotten a piece of poster revenue. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It fucking would have been rich as hell. Oh yeah. Dorm room poster. I feel like it just came with a dorm. He didn't make any of that dorm room poster money. It was either that or the velvet underground. Bob Marley. Yeah, Bob Marley. I had a Rocky one. Yeah, Rocky. I had Rocky, dude. That was cool as hell. There was this dude in college that was like, okay, I can tell the story. He's not listening to pocket. He like was like presented like has this alpha male like, you know, like, fuck get my dick sucked to like whatever. Yeah. In his bedroom, a six foot poster of Leonidas from the movie 300 just with just wearing underpants and a cape. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rippling abs and like just huge pecs and like Gerard Butler, whatever. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. And it's just like in his bedroom. He had this massive like six, like to scale buff guy. Yeah. To scale. And then his, my friend, his roommate one day went on his, went on his laptop to to Jack off to porn, I guess. Damn. And all of his searches are like guy, guy fucks guy, but they're not gay. Too, too straight guys fucking each other. Guy fucks for the first time, but other guy. And I think he's, I don't think he's out of the closet. Really? He's still living like bro. That's hilarious. Yeah, there's so many, somebody had a bit in Baltimore about like all the not gay shit on Craigslist where it's just like half of the people are like, yeah, I'm a straight guy. Just look at a, you know, watch football and suck off some dudes. And it's just like this fucking huge, you're on the gay hookup like alley of the internet. You're on the like Craigslist. You're on Craigslist. I'm not gay though. I just, you know, there's so many talk about being straight and just like, you know, Ravens and sucking each other off. That's probably part of it. You remember that like post that used to go around the internet about like that guy who wanted to have like a meetup or like, he's like, basically I just want to recreate the sleepovers I had when I was like 12. So he's like inviting other middle-aged men over to his house where they would like play Super Nintendo and jack off with each other. And then if one person sucks off another person, it's like no big deal. It's like, you know, that guy's just hoping for it to become a big gay fuck. He just needs plausible deniability. The amount you could lie to yourself, dude, about what you like to beat off to. Oh, for sure. The years. For years. Yeah. That's why you got to beat off to everything. Every type of porn. Well, just to do it. Just to like see how women feel. I watch gay porn every night. Yeah. The Arthur Chu classic. I had a weird gay sex dream last night. Really? Yeah. Well, I was watching, you know those like fat motorcycle twins? No. Uh, the, I forget their name. They did, they were professional wrestlers. You know that Simpsons episode where they have some trial and like Lionel Hutz is like, I'm calling in surprise witness after surprise witness and then they have those two fat twins on a motorcycle. Oh, yeah. I remember them from the Simpsons episode, but I don't remember them yet. Yeah, yeah. That was like some cultural reference. I gotcha. I always forget their name and their story. One of them died, I think, but like. They weren't wrestlers or they were wrestlers? They were involved in wrestling at a certain point. Okay. I think they had the record for being the fattest twins, but anyhow, it was, uh, it was them, uh, fucking each other and I like witnessed that. Wait. This is last night. Yeah. Last night. Two fat motorcycle twins fuck each other in the ass. One of them had a strap on and then the other one had a vagina. So I think this is, okay, I got a story after you. Well, I think it was because there was an article that was shared. Yeah. About F to M's. Yeah. The F to M, uh, like man breastfeeding. There was like a man. So what's happened a couple of times is that giant hairy tit and there's a baby drinking off of it and it like, I mean, yeah, that's where my transphobia kicks in right there. I'm like, oh, this is, I don't have any transphobia. It's just like, you know, and then I think it's incredible. It's the fucking, I'm like, all right, this is too much. I see that. And I'm like, come on. It's not too, it's not too much, but it's my reaction to that is like, now can we laugh at it? Yeah. Yeah. Right. It's amazing. To a point where it's like, just take it fucking, I think it's beautiful. Shut the fuck up fucking. I just want to know. I'm like, off your stance of, am I supposed to give up my seat to that on the train? I need to get up out of my seat on the train to let that person sit down. Like, yeah, if they are like a construction, that's interesting. You know, I don't, like, I don't understand how I'm supposed. So I guess it was seeing that picture and then that's what made me. How many times has an F2M asked you to get up from your seat at the train? Every time I sit on the train, it's always these trainees that are like, you're going to move, sir. I'm also a man, but I have a pussy. Yeah. I actually, I don't think I've given up my seat on the train maybe once ever. I did once. I do it quite often. Sometimes when it's a mother with like a bunch of kids, I feel bad. Yeah. I was fantasized about like. I feel worse for like mothers with like three kids. Absolutely. I have this fantasy in my head. I'll do where like, you know, like someone will ask me to get out of the seat. And then where I'm just like, you know, I'll like be like, well, yeah, that's fine. But just to let you know, I'm like a veteran. I was like. I lie to them that I'm a veteran and then people find out somehow and then every one of the train beats the shit out of me. You steal ballet. It's like having like a fantasy. I have a trolling gone wrong, man, you just want your life, you just want your life, your way of life to end. You just want to be freed of this prison you've made for yourself. Some guy, some guy pretending to be a veteran on the train so he doesn't have to give up his seat to a pregnant woman and then people find out and beat him to death. That's how I like, I think in my head, that would be honestly, yeah. If I heard that's the way you died, I would feel so happy for you. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know why I create those scenarios in my head. That's beautiful, dude. Yeah. You know, you think about you're on the platform and they'll be like, you know, like a disabled person and you're like, what if I just pushed him on the tracks and you wouldn't do it. But it's, you think it's like Tourette's or whatever. I never think of it with a disabled person. I think it was like Wall Street got like suit. I think it's just killing myself. I think about it. It's killing myself and like sometimes I'll fantasize about people pushing me on the tracks and like... It's now a nervous tick of mine that I say under my breath. I say, I don't know. When people are fawning over like a baby, I just think about like how funny it would be if for like, just like, just wailed that baby in the face. How people would be like, what the fuck is wrong with you? I'm like, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know why. You could literally make a baby's head explode if you hit it hard enough. Yeah. And it's like, I don't even want to punch the baby. I don't even want to be mad at me. This is the most enlightening fucking, this is the most psychological profile of Nick for these last three minutes. Yeah. I just want to be mad at me. Listeners of Come Town. Because if they're mad, they're not paying it, they care. Listeners of Come Town, this is a public service announcement. Irony can ruin a brain. Yeah. Can break your brain. Yeah. Another part of that dream I had, like a weird thing last night. I had a dream. I was at some event, like there was a show or something, but then the Joker showed up and he was ruining everything. The Joker? Yeah, the Joker was there. Who was it? Which one? He? It was Nebula. Jack. Switch. He just felt like it was the Joker. Yeah. It was the Joker. Probably the one from the cartoon. Yeah. But then people were responding to the Joker being like, ooh, you're like a scary clown that's so edgy or whatever. Yeah. And he was like, shut up. Yeah. And he was like, the Joker was getting defensive about it. Right, right, right. And then people were reacting to the Joker as if it was someone that thought they were the Joker. Interesting. And then that was what was happening. That was after the twins fucked each other with a strap on? Yeah. One time I had a very weird, I was fucking just like, in my head, a beautiful woman. Like this was years ago. This was when I was like 16 or 17. And just like a beautiful, like, hairless woman. I was fucking her in the ass. And then, like, I just turned around. And then at some point, she just turned around and she had my friend, Tommy's face in her head. Oh, yeah, I've had that. Yeah. And like Tommy is the ugliest friend I've ever had in my, like Tommy is like hilariously bad, dude. You're in love with Tommy. You know what I'm saying? He's got this, yeah, he's got this weird skin tag on his ear that you just played with. Did you want to suck on? And he's just got like, cuddle with him and suck on his skin tag. He's got like this weird, like clown hair, like his hair looks like a shitty clown wig. And it's not, it was just one of the weirdest. He just went to Greek Orthodox church next day. And that's where you had to leave Greek town. And that's, yeah, after that wet dream. People found out about that dream. What's Greek church like? Break that shit down for me. Greek church? Yeah. That shit lasts a nice long amount of time. The costumes are wild. Is it mostly hors d'oeuvres? Yeah. Yeah. It's all fucking grape leaves. I feel like I'm holding this for you to dip the crowd. Dude, yeah. The costumes, they go off. The priest have all this gold. They look so cool. I was an altar boy. I was an altar boy. You were. Is that why you had that dream? Is there a dream? It wasn't a dream. The priest was a magic. Are they celibate? You're whispering it to me. Are they celibate? No, here's the thing. Greek priest, it's like if you want to go far, if you want to be like a bishop or some shit, you can't fuck. But if you just want to be like a community priest, you have to fuck. You have to get a wife. So they fuck. So Greek priest fuck. So guess what's not an issue in the Greek church is fucking. Wait, what if you want to keep going? Can you stop fucking and be like a guy that's like, you know, I'm trying to get my life back together and not fuck. Once you get married, you're done, so you can't. You can't become a bishop. Right. You rise to the race. What is it? Bishop, deacon, cardinal. I think deacon's much lower. Deacon's not even a priest. Deacon, you're trying to become a priest. Then there's like fucking bishops and then there's archbishops. That's so complicated. I have all of the military ones memorized. Yeah. I don't fucking know. There's one guy. There's one guy named Bartholomew. They came through. Lieutenant. Yeah. Private, private, first class, corporal, uh, sergeant. And then there's like first sergeant, like, master sergeant, gunnery sergeant. I think gunnery sergeant. With guns. No. That's like, that's a Marine Corps thing. Yeah. I think so. I just remember that from when I was, when I went to fucking, I went to do a Marine tour and I learned shit about them that I wasn't expecting to. It was weird as shit to go on that tour and like meet people who enlisted literally right after 9-11. Like that's what, that's who, that's who they're like, and I was like, oh man. And they're just like, look, there's just these hardened fucking vets who've seen everything they're fucking. You can tell they're fucked up. And then the younger Marines. Don't respect them. And then the young guys. Don't get close to respecting them on my show, dude. And then the younger ones are just like fucking kids who were too dumb to go to college. You know, like, not like, like, like half of it. And they haven't seen shit. They're like 17, 18, oh yeah, poor kids for sure. From like middle of nowhere. Middle of nowhere, just like learning fucking, learning life. My friend joined the Marines when we were like teenagers and you know, like he grew up in a military family and I don't know, I feel kind of bad putting shit out there. But so like, I knew him my whole life and his mom was like a naval officer. And then his mom's roommate quote unquote was also a naval officer, which yeah, so he had those donuts on tell time. Yeah. So he had like him, like just like dyke moms, yeah, and naval officer, yeah, those are real lesbians. That's as lesbian as it gets funny because I remember like bullying him about it when I was like six, yeah, yeah, like being like your mom's a dyke, you know, and I'm like, well, how did I know that, you know, fucking haircut. You heard it enough. Yeah. Dad said it. No, it was my dad. Honestly, probably from just watching Jerry Springer and shit when I was like, the first time I heard it was because your dad's a bad dad. You didn't indirectly bad dad. How's your bad dad? Let me watch television. Let me watch television. He's a good father. Yeah, that's what being sick from school for me was Jerry Springer. Yeah. You catch prices right then Springer. My mom, I don't know. She just, I didn't watch anything cool for a very long time. My dad will let me watch whatever the fuck I wanted. My parents used to take me to like rated our way before I was old enough to. I saw a con air when I was like six with my dad. Did they make you beat off in the theater to nude scenes? I remember. Well, remember, there's a kid. There's a prison bitch. I'm just asking. I mean, there's a prison bitch character in Con Air, like the second the plane crashes. He's just like opening. Yeah. He's putting on dresses. Yeah. And my dad just looks at me. I was like, I don't know. Maybe like nine or 10. And he just looks at me. He goes, it's a vet. That's a very sick man. I don't know. He's a very sick man. Not in the part about like the rapist or no, no, he's no, the worst guy was the guy that liked to wear dresses. I guess. Yeah. Well, it is. He is not the dude that had the Hannibal Lecter face thing on who was the bad guy. Who's like the ultra bad guy? Buscemi John Malkovich John Malkovich Cyrus, the virus Cyrus, that's such a good movie. What is star studded cast? They destroy Vegas in it. So, yeah, our con air is actually like, and then there's other ones like John Lithgau's in it. Yeah. Yeah. Isn't he? The FBI guy? Maybe. Yeah. I think he is. Yeah. It's Nick Cage. Danny Trejo who Brandon just learned about. Yeah. Buscemi. Is Ving Reims in it? Dude, it was so funny. Just to shit on Brandon real quick. We went to go get a sandwich and some guy was like, are you the Dix out for Harambe guy? And then it was like, yeah, yeah. And then another guy outside of an event that Brandon was like hosting was like, are you the Dix out for Harambe guy? And then Brandon was like, oh, he tweeted, a million people have come up to be in New York asking me if I'm the Dix out for Harambe guy. And I was like, literally it has been two people, you fucking idiot. A million. Yeah. He was like, people keep stopping me in New York. And it's like, no, motherfucker. Even if it was. Two people did. Even if it was a million people, what the fuck are you bragging about? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, a joke I stole from a bunch of other people that I said. I think he made that one up, but he was Brandon has never made anything up in his life. Yeah. Copy paste. We're done. I had a friend at college. Yeah. Iphone. Iphone or charger. His logo should just be control C control V on the on the world star comment section. I had a nice time with Brandon. We went to it was nice to see him. We had we went to some stupid shit, some VMA pre party thing. Oh, yeah, dude. I ate a weed edible that was 25 milligrams THC. And then we like stepped outside and I was in Manhattan, like as high as maybe I was in like set, like, like ninth grade, you know, that kind of high. And I was just like looking at the building. So I was like, this is fucking Mordor, man, we're in Mordor, man, I gotta get out of here. I hit. I did not like any of that MTV because it's like, I went like an MTV party with him after the thing. And he was like, this is just an office party, but everyone works at MTV. Oh, yeah. So she's like, just as boring as being an office where you don't know anyone, but it's like everyone also thinks they're cool. If you know what I mean, the thing I went to had like an emcee for that was like, he's like a MTV personality Brandon told me. And he's just like on stage. He's like, it was so embarrassing. It was like the one camp counselor that was trying to be the cool counselor is like making announcements. Yo, I see y'all is like this, you know, this white, like pretty boy rapper dude. He's like, I see y'all taking pictures. I see y'all in that snapchat. Make sure you use the VMA Taco Bell, live moss, geo filter anytime you take a picture. And people are just like clapping and I'm like, Oh God, this guy, this guy's life. He probably wants to kill himself. No, he loves it. Dude. I worked at Jimmy John's for four hours one time and the manager I had to report to was like two years younger than me and just like a fucking loser or whatever. And I like stopped going there because he interrupted me while I was rolling up a sandwich or whatever. And I've worked at a billion fucking sandwich and short order grilled jobs or whatever. So I'm rolling up a sandwich and I started rolling it in like the deli paper from the corner and then you fold like a burrito. And I get about halfway through and he like puts his hand on the sandwiches and rolling it and he's like, you did what I like to call a subway wrap. And we actually do it different here. And I was like, peace. See you later. You're gonna work with you micromanage. Like who's what customer is going to fucking like open their bag and be like, Oh, I can't wait to eat that. What the fuck? What the fuck is this? Why is it rolled like this? I didn't go to subway and went to Jimmy John's where they got fun shit on the wall. It's so funny how people think. I mean, that is an example. No one matters, but that guy couldn't matter less. Oh, yeah. So he does. He's my friend's roommate. And I went to like hang out at their house one time. And then I saw after you left Jimmy, yeah, and I saw the manager coming to the manager and I saw him come out of the room and like, but he like hit the, I work hard. I play hard like him off the clock and he's got like this shitty, stupid silk shirt on and like shitty son. Oh, yes. And he's like smoking a bowl thinking he's like so cool. And it's like, you're the least cool dude in this fucking head. Yeah, dude. Everyone hates you. Everyone hates Jimmy John's. Jimmy John's sucks. Don't they make their workers sign non-compete clauses when they can't do sandwiches ever? I swear to God. Yeah. That's they, that was like a big thing. They pay like shit. Yeah. Of course. Jimmy John. Yeah. He's one of those guys. He's one of those dudes that goes and kills giraffes. I was trying to do a bit about firehouse subs for a while, which is like a real regional thing. Yeah. I think, yeah, they're only in the DC area. I think Virginia and DC. I think it started in Virginia. But like they're commercial. That's why the, well, it's also not a particularly funny bit, but I love the ads for firehouse subs or like, we're firefighters and we got tired of eating subs we didn't like. So we started our own place and it's like, yeah, that doesn't give you any credibility when it comes to making sandwiches. Yeah. Firefighters aren't known for their sandwiches. Yeah. You're just trying to cash in on the fact that you're generally sympathetic. Yeah. Yeah. Which is so funny. Well, it's like, why are you so busy the bit? Why are you so busy making it? Is that why we lost both of the towers? Yeah. Because you were busy fucking around with meatballs? Get in those towers. Put the fucking sandwich knife down. That's a good bit. Yeah. I do love, and it was great when it would tank and then I was like, ah, it's because it's a 9-11 joke. And then people were like, what the fuck is firehouse subs? Yeah, it's hilarious. You were just being mean. Yeah. I love, firefighter is a great, like if you're a racist, just be a firefighter instead of a cop. Or just be a racist and do whatever you want. No, I don't be, that's what I mean. If you were a racist though. What do you mean though? Like in terms of feeder occupations for racists, like blue collar racists, you could be a racist computer programmer. But your boss coming like, ah, Jeremy, great work, but why are all of your variable names just slurred? I don't know anything about programming, I just context clues left at that joke. Yeah, yeah. Thanks guys. No worries. Well Adam didn't. Adam's not even holding the microphone to his face anymore. Yeah. What do you mean? Well I know man, it's been 51 minutes. Sorry I didn't laugh at the racist computer program. It's been fucking better dude. Dude, are you a sleepy boy? You've been very woke this podcast, I gotta be honest with you. And I don't like it. I don't like it at all. Say something offensive right now. Yeah, say it. Right now. Bitch. Say rape is good. Say something offensive. Say all that rape stuff you were saying. Tell the story. No, I'm not gonna tell that. Alright, don't tell it. Damn, in the context of what we were just talking about, that's hilarious. You have to say something offensive though, for real. Right now. I don't, I don't like identical twins. I don't trust them. Okay. That's right. That's just more of a... I think fraternal twins are worse, because there's one of them that clearly got fucked up. They fucked up jeans. Really? Yeah. There's always one that's got red hair and can't dance or sing. I feel like if I had an identical twin, no fraternal twins are just like, they're not like, if I had an identical twin, I would 69 from the age of 13 to 17. Pretty much every day. Donald Trump's sons look like fraternal twins. They do, but they're different ages. I see what you're saying. Yeah. I mean, they're completely separate births. One of his sons just has the softest fucking chin on earth. Who? Eric? I think so, yeah. One of them. The blonde one? No, no, the other one. I can't remember it's Eric or Brambo. No. It's Brambo and Eric and Goose Step. Goose or his son's name. One of them looks exactly like Odo from Deep Space Nine. I don't remember what Odo looks like. He just doesn't have eyebrows in it. He can change shape. He's like a shape shifter, but he didn't grow up with a family or whatever. So his natural, you know, it's funny, he just sleeps in a bucket on the show. He just turns back into a puddle of cum and at the end of the day, he goes back in his room and just like splash and just turns into electric cum. Yes, Nine was the Black Captain. Dick Stockton Nine, yeah. Deep Space Nine, Black Captain, Cisco. Cisco, Ben Cisco. And then I saw the other name Voyager and that's the Hillary Clinton. That's Hillary Clinton. Oh, that woman is so hot. We've talked about this. The woman. Yeah. We've talked about Sergeant. She has big ass titties. Yeah, yeah. And I wanted... What? Janeway? Doesn't one of them have big ass titties? The rogue, the Borg, Seven of Nine has huge titties. Yeah, she's so hot. Fuck. They didn't have a sexy lady character from the get-go on Voyager. They had like a female captain and then I don't know the internal politics or what happened, but they added Seven of Nine in like season six or seven because they're like, all right, we got to have a character that's just a hot woman for girls to beat off to. And that's when she got added to the show. Oh, nice. Because they were like, you know, let's not do the fucking like on, like Deanna Troy on Enterprise, like she's just, which is the dumbest fucking character I love. Her job, but she was an empath, so she could understand people's feelings, which is an alien, by the way. It's not even a fucking human to explain it to the autistic fucking retards that watch Star Trek, how empathy works, and they're like, well, there's certain aliens that understand how other people are feeling. I feel like that's, oh, that's interesting. We could use the false answer here, so artistic. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. Everything's very interesting. Yeah. It's logic. It's just autistic. Yeah. This is not logical. Yeah. Not very logical. Yeah. No. Women owe me sex. Those shows are great. This is an episode of Star Trek that we watched when I was taking French in middle school. Oh, Picard, French, obviously. Wow. Jean-Luc. Yeah. That's the reason we watched it. It was a regular episode. Jean-Luc Picard? Yeah, where they meet this alien race, and so they have these... The original series? No, next generation. TNG. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the reason they can understand all the aliens, it's like, they just have some computer that translate, it can pick up, it understands syntax, and it immediately translates. So they meet this race that it doesn't translate for, and only partially translates, because the way they communicate is by telling somebody a story, or reminding them of a story, and then whatever happened in that story fits the situation. So this guy's trying to communicate with... Wow, that's really confusing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So he's like, you know, shaka when the walls fell, and this might be the name of the episode or whatever, and he's like, you know, Dalmauk at Tanagra, and he just says shit like that, and Picard the whole time is like, yes, but what does it mean? And I was like laughing with people on Twitter a couple months ago, like, instead of like the stories, the aliens are just being like, the pussy, the asshole, and the vagina, then Picard being like, yes, but what does it mean? The asshole, the woman, the woman's asshole and pussy, what is that, some kind of warning? The woman's asshole and vagina, the pussy entrance. What is he trying to say? It wouldn't be hard to add it together. That would be so stupid. Yeah, you could do that. Yeah, so you just need a guy saying pussy asshole. What have we got clothes on? What's happened recently? I haven't left my house, I bought a TV. Yeah, Nick's rich now. Nick's rich now. I've been a shut-in for three weeks. I've been a shut-in for three weeks. I've been working on that show, so I haven't really had time to go out. What did you miss? Nothing dude. Nothing really. Oh, we have a show. Yes, next Sunday, we have a show. Did we finish booking it? Yeah, we're done. Oh yeah? Yeah, I got Kurt. Hell yeah dude, that's a great show. Oh yeah, Kurt Metzger is going to be on the show. Dan Soder, Kurt Metzger, Anna Fabrega, you know, three-alt, super-altic, Fabrega, Fabrygia, Fabrog. Fabrog, Fabrog, Fabrog, Fabrog, Fabrogiani. I think that's enough. They'll do, we can let them do a little bit more time, let them do 12. Are we planning the show on the podcast right now? Anyway, guys, on 9-11, September 11th, 11-9 if you're from Europe, we're having a show. Second, come on everybody, thank you so much for everyone that came out of the floor. Did they call it, didn't call it 11-9 elsewhere? Do they call it 11-9? No, they call it 9-11. Do we get to name it because it's our thing? You know, like when there's a war somewhere else, we get to name it because we're America? I think they call it the 11th of September. Yeah, that's what they call it in Greece. Yeah. Well, we gotta put a fucking stop to that. Yeah, it's offensive. Yeah, it's absolutely offensive. It's offensive. They don't get to decide what our shit's called. Dude, I agree. Fuck them. Does Trump know about this? I don't think he does. We have so much to learn. We're gonna stop them. We're gonna call it 9-11, like normal people. I love how the fuck he's trying to get black people to just vote for him. Yeah, yeah. It's so awesome. Oh, I love it. Hey, what do you gotta lose? Everyone was mad about that in the writers' room, they're like, can you believe he said that? And it's like, one, yes. Two, like, for Trump, that's not a bad argument. You know, like, try it out, you know, see if you like it. Yeah. That's kind of reasonable. Yeah. I mean, he's not gonna be like, yeah, I'm racist, but maybe you could be racist, too, against yourself. You know, like, what's he gonna say? Like, of course, you know, what do you have to lose? Just so funny, just going to black churches, like, just completely, and just, I always love when they get just an insane person to be like, I'm a conservative black guy. I love those guys. That's the best. That's the best. Yeah. Well, he has that one pastor guy with the, whose throat hurts, he always has the sore throat. Yeah. And he just shouts that. We should get a conservative black guy for the podcast. So we have on all the time. You want to? We could get the ghost of Patrice. Yeah. And then we get a conservative black guy that agrees with everything I say about Seth. Check and really put Seth in a bind. Well, I can't disagree with the black person demanding to use the N word. I told him to stop. That's my favorite thing in the world. We were saying this yesterday. Why people asking black people not to use the N word so much. Oh my God. It is the best. It is the best. Yeah. And then could you also just not use the water fountain either? It just depends on me. They used to drown people like you a little bit worried about using the water fountain and then also the bathroom just in case. Oh, fuck. Well, yeah. So come out to our 11th of September show 11th of September at 9 p.m. Come on everybody on Franklin off the G train class in the stop in Brooklyn. It was really great last time when it was really good guys. I'm not saying that just to brag like we and we really appreciate all the come boys that came through and come people really. No, come boy is not a gendered term. Yeah. Come boy, you could be a girl. Come boy. Yeah. Come boy. So give us money, please. And yeah, give us some fucking give us well, we got to set up a we're going to start doing premium content. We're going to do like an extra episode or something. Yes. Yes. Yeah. And if you want to do that shit, you got to pay extra bitch. We'll figure it out. We're going to start doing two episodes. We'll get done. Yeah. And then we'll put one episode behind the paywall. We're going to go to Sunset Park right now and get the most fires. Yes. If you're listening live on barbecue, come hang out. No, I want to get some barbecue. What are you? I ate so much. Yeah. Yeah. Whoa. Whoa. Where's the barbecue? One of them with that. One of them with that opportunity. You can't wait. Is it? No, dude. Down syndrome. You're out of order. Down syndrome. But you know, you're out of order. You're out of order. You're out of order. Who, man? Who, right? It doesn't change. Yeah. Who, ah. Who, ah. Oh, we were singing on the way over here. Down East or Alexa by Springsteen is by Billy Joel. Billy Joel. Yeah. Billy Joel. Jewish Elvis. Well, I'm on the Down syndrome, Alexa. Then my hands are up on a tits, whatever. You change it. And you put in the hotel, and they say she's slow, but them titties ain't retarded. Yeah. What a great joke. Yeah. Man, I'm changing all those. I had, everyone at the office, I got them with the, well, I'm the kind of guy that fucks his mom and dad. That's perfect. That was making the rounds. That might be the best one you've done. My favorite one is, dad, dad, fuck my dad. I fuck my dad. I fuck my dad. I fuck my dad. I fuck my dad. I fuck my dad. I fuck my dad. I fuck my dad. I fuck my dad. I fuck my dad. I fuck my dad. I fuck my dad. I fuck my dad. Yeah, no, that one's a good one. That's great. I think that's a good way to close, boys. Yeah. Oh, no, the other Down East or Alexa one was, well, I'm busting inside the vagina, which doesn't really fit, but that was been stuck in my head for a week. I was kind of hoping the cat would throw up or shit again, because it was such a great way to end the podcast. Yeah, I don't want to see that ever again in my life. I guess not. When that cat threw up, I was like, I'm screaming, fam. Yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, oh, oh, oh, wait. That's Brandon, famous comedian Brandon Wardell. Well, Twitter personality. Yeah. All right. We got to go. Bye. Bye. Bye. Well, what do you think if we put the kids on the floor? We don't. Yeah.",

        "transcript_text": " Hello everybody, welcome to come towns 11 11 you're right nice so I got right yeah 9 9 11 we skipped right from do we have an episode 10 can we not have one can we go straight from 9 to 11 well we already did we did well the last one was in that episode 11 then now as you know right then this one's episode 12 it's like in in buildings where they skip the 13th floor the 13th floor because I don't know it's like a superstition yeah superstition the word about ghosts yeah yeah yeah there's actually a movie called Nightmare on the 13th floor and I asked sometimes I asked people and I've seen it a bunch and I say to people have you seen Nightmare on the 13th floor and they go oh the 13th floor I'm like no it's a different movie I wouldn't have said Nightmare on the 13th floor if I meant have you seen Nightmare before Christmas oh yeah Nightmare on Elm Street no that's a completely different thing you took those I'm fucking I've been lifting weights and I'm ready to just fucking be a sarcastic I like when you get if you get strong enough like you think you're funny because you just you just dismissive sorry oh yeah no that's real funny dude psych that's this they they psych people like is the best though 45 well I mean I feel like we're really bearing the lead here Nick no we're not this is we're back in Manhattan at the top of oh yeah we're at the top of the Anthony Kumiya Studios the snake pit the Puerto Rican rattlesnake some asshole on Twitter tried to say that Louis J Gomez is the original Puerto Rican yeah I don't like that he stole that from us first of all he's not even Puerto Rican Louis J he's not even I think he's just an insane clown posse yeah he's an insane clown I think they're like listen joke theft is very serious in comedy and like we're not like gonna be Joe Rogan's about it and like call you out but like I am dude that's why I'm going to the gym that's why I'm getting strong yeah is I'm doing MMA to confront jokes the confront Lewis about stealing the Puerto Rican rattlesnake nickname from us yeah me and me and Lewis are gonna have a fucking four and a half second fight and then we both run out of breath because either of us are actually in shape I like how people look at Lewis and they're like oh that in the comedy community and they're like yeah Lewis is in like good shape but in any other community he looks like shit yeah that's how every comedian everyone who's hot for a comedian is just like not ugly like that's it we got really low smart like people think I'm smart yeah and they're not I haven't read a book in fucking five years yeah no I read those before five legit six years ago six yeah I found out Dumbledore was gay and he's like this is about me what the fuck dude dude are you gonna be like this we talked about this off mic and I don't want to stop with the gay because I am secretly gay what I'll edit that out yeah we'll edit that out so there's no less than I'm kind of there's no real like burying the lead here because it's gonna be in the description of the episode yeah so people know yeah we should say it should still break it down well I gotta call them in in eight minutes well let's just say it some people won't understand some people can't read that's true people who can't read a click probably are definitely in our top three guests well Dr. Evil is the best guess Dr. Evil is probably the biggest guess we've had second biggest second biggest guess we have David Cross the real David Cross it's not a character this isn't actually but yeah it's not it we actually David Cross we told Seth he could come on and do his famous David Cross how funny would be if we set up like we're like guys seriously David Cross is gonna be on the show I promise you it's David Cross and then we do a two and a half hour episode and it's like oh okay now it's time to call them and then it's that hello everybody just kidding yeah that would be that would be great but see because I said that that's how you know that it's not that's not the joke right right right it's it's really him yeah we're excited yeah well see now we already mentioned that so what are we gonna talk about the next well five and a half minutes so I don't know Kumiya studios they don't really have the perfect setup or technology for well I have to explain that to David when we call him okay unfortunately yeah I came up with a really smart plan well yeah I only have there's only one you can only plug one set of headphones into the four tracks so I'll be the only one that can actually hear him but he'll be you know I call him on the phone you guys the audience will be able to hear him but Adam and Stavros won't I guess we could yeah I mean the head the earbuds won't even stretch across the table so we can't split I'm gonna have to we're gonna have to figure out a way to you don't do it but you guys that's like you know remember in Apollo 13 when they get stuck on the moon and they're like how do we or they don't get they get stuck they're in space they go they're they're trying to get to the moon and they you know something happens you know a bunch of alarms go off and you know the spoilers Houston we have a Houston I have a problem that line is actually from Apollo 13 and it's well what happens is they're there in space and they have a problem and they have to get back and so back at Houston they're you know like we don't take there's no you don't say no or quit for an answer we don't and they use you know they come together and they get a bunch of like stuff out of the supply closet I'm serious that's a scene in the movie yeah and that's how they save Apollo 13 is with a bunch of odds and ends so that's what we're doing David Cross is the moon this podcast is Apollo 13 right I'm Tom Hanks no I'm Tom Hanks I said it who's the sexy who's the other one I'm Tom Hanks yeah it's Tom Hanks Gary Sinise Ed Harris I'm the city of Houston yeah that's cool yeah the whole place I'm I'm was it Quantrell X who's the big Houston guy the big is nation Islam I don't know I don't know I'm that guy he's in the movie he's mad that they won't let black people go to space I'm James Harden is Barry Pepper in that movie he should be Barry Pepper is in every movie about World War two I went to his I went to his Twitter page we're trying to get Barry Pepper is against I would love to get the pet I don't even know who he is yes you do you know who he is like he's in saving private Ryan he's in like all he's got that weird pinched face yeah he beats up a lot of horses in that movie I tried to he's the main character in Battlefield Earth I've never seen it I tried to do a drinking game to that movie where you drink every time John Travolta like laughs like forces laughter like a man animal every time he does that you have to drink and you won't make it through that movie also so many horses get injured in the first 15 fuck them dude fuck animals that's my stance well it's important for Scientology you got to spread the gospel you got to kill some horses you don't you can't you don't make lemonade without killing some horses yeah that's true that's one of the expressions from Apollo 13 yeah that's right yeah the Houston guy comes in I still think I should be boss you don't make lemonade unless you kill some horses and then they go into the supply closet and there's just a closet in a fucking spaceship I feel like his in Captain Phillips his Boston accent was so bad he should have just gone retard he should have gone for us gone pretty tired to be a Boston guy listen it's a very slight difference pretty close listen to me I'm the captain now but no in what we're talking about Barry Papper very yep yeah I went to Barry Pappers Twitter page and he's doing some like challenge some 22 push ups for 22 days to stop the troops from killing themselves first of all that's not that he was the troops in so many movies that he feels like he is in real life that makes sense no that he's got a good point he's basically the troops yeah he's been in a fake fake fucking costumes and shit yeah well he's been in all the good war movies we're so nervous was Ian platoon I know there's two minutes left and I'm like watching the clock like it's like it's an execution be professional fucking broadcasters right now well I'm just hoping it won't be Wikipedia a lot because I know some of his to be honest with you the only thing I've seen that he's done is run running run okay yeah I don't know what that is but no he was in you know what it sounds like I picked that like the most obscure reference but it's it's actually true I've seen run running run like yeah like three or four times when I was like 15 I thought it was hilarious he's in putty tank for a second is he yeah we should ask him you should ask him you know whatever we what that was he was in the Smurfs we got to do we got to do a gargamel we got to do an hour with him so we're doing a full full hour we're gonna aim for that okay yeah I'm down if it goes much shorter if he's like mad about the setup I don't even know a lot going on these days he's as well we'll talk about that with him we got a minute left if you guys want to plug anything I have like half of an apple that I'm thinking about eating I'll sell a bit from now on that's what I want to plug stop sending me pictures of your titties which I get a lot of I'm gonna call him now yeah it's fine all right then you know what that'll seem professional yeah these guys are they're like professional radio guys

were gonna get we were gonna we only have like an hour to do our podcast and then there's a place in a story yeah and that kind of time I mean they have to be like helicoptered in and then the helicopter can even land they'd have to literally like hover over where you are and drop them from a height they might break so that this is that's not gonna work that okay well we actually plan to only use the one set of headphones but well then what's well you know oh sorry I was just explaining that the plan is where I'm gonna use the headphones and then Adam is here if yeah if you can you

am I supposed to wear the headphones or not no I see I'm wearing one one of the ears and then I'm gonna share the other ear with Adam and Stavros and we're really just explain I think with as far as us goes the four of us this will sort of work seamlessly it'll take a couple of seconds to figure out you know the ins and outs of how this will work and then it's mostly just explain you guys there there's three of us here but then you is four and this most yeah the exposition is is all for the audience this is um you know so they am I supposed to be I'm not supposed to be there with you no no no we wanted to do it over the phone so this actually it's okay got it yeah then then there seems to be going because to be honest with you you're our first phone guest and we wanted to like sort of have like a dry run with someone that was small enough to like hey come on come on dude let's fuck dude he can hear you yeah so we just yeah we want to like just see make sure it works and I mean it's going well so you don't want to shoot your wand on like you know a Seth Rogen or something like that yeah well we don't this is actually not even really much of like a comedy podcast we have last week we had on Amber Frost who's she writes stuff and she's my roommate she I pay rent to her but she's like a journalist and yeah so yeah we did like a whole episode on like on Brett on Brexit so it's like it's like the political stuff we do shampoo yeah I guess we could talk about shamp like the shampoo cry like if there's a shampoo crisis anything anything yet like political stuff but you are like this it's an honor to have you on we're all you know we're all fans me and Adam and Stavros fans big big I think I think I think you're doing great I think that Rogan will respond to that that's a smart thing to say at front do you have a number something um say what let's go ahead Adam do you have his number email yeah it's two one three okay six nine eight yeah 1842 okay thanks man thank you what was that what do you say um but let's nice we should intro you for our pineapple express man we should intro you for our like our guests on the show or I mean our listeners who listen to the show who who may not be familiar David Cross is you know probably like our our biggest our biggest guest so far he's been on television he's been in feature films do you have you do you have a book radio radio radio he's done radio have you authored any feature radio I've done feature podcast you know PSA they did PSA okay so you're no stranger to the podcast format so the upfront you know you just intro the guests and tell us some of your like your your biggest hits what's yeah what are you yeah what are your like your big hits we in what in what sense I'm not sure like if they did it if they were like huge if they were like here's the guy and then here's like play the hits you know and then they pointed at you like a presumably like an audience of some kind why don't you know I'm not I don't I don't I'm not a musician I don't have I don't have hits per se like top like a as a as a comedian I don't we don't kind of rake our jokes that way there's no like chart I guess that that's what you're that's really interesting I'm just gonna yeah so there's no he said that he said that he's not a musician and as a comedian you're like your top 10 lists they don't they prefer comedians will prefer not to do top 10 lists your favorite band then well no that's not that's not what I said I I just say we don't prefer it I just say they don't chart there's no that you can't you can't really keep track of a you don't purchase you don't joke isn't like a commodity that's so you don't remember or you know you remember your top hits then no he's saying he really remembers them he just they don't you don't rank them it's like if you had children you wouldn't be like hey you know John's the best and Stevie's the worst even though you know Stevie has like you know mental disability or something you would say they're the same both in your heart I love both of them even though one of them is better yeah I guess that analogy would apply if you were to re-rank your kids weekly but we that doesn't really happen and I guess unless there was an introduction of a new kid every once in a while I yeah that's not the best analogy really but um but yeah just to go back there's no I if I would you know I'd probably just sort of give them a funny look and say would be talking about okay let's talk for a second about well we'll talk about that but many people might be familiar with you from a little thing called Mr. Show and I would be lying if I said that I haven't seen an episode or two and I'm certain I'm certain that my friends here I've watched a lot on YouTube yeah I've seen a lot on YouTube yeah we were we're fans of the show but for you know listeners that may not be familiar why don't you can you tell us a little bit a little bit about that sure it was a sketch show that ran for a couple years with Bob Odin Kirk and a bunch of other talented funny folks back in the mid 90s me to late 90s I guess on HBO and that stands for home box office is that correct I I haven't really checked in but it used to it I don't know if that's changed I know they have came a throne on now so I don't know if that yeah it might be like one of those like with like a KFC situation where it used to be right Kentucky fried chicken and then you know the government actually made them change it because that's true the chickens are so genetically modified that they're not legally they're not legally they're not allowed to call them chickens anymore I did yeah I saw I you know I it could be on one of those sites that I visit when I get drunk website I thought it was kinder that kinder but there's Kentucky right there's Kentucky fried chicken and then there's Kennedy fried chicken and they're right but only one of them is KFC the KFC was the one that used to be Kentucky fried chicken and then they they short right now they brought Colonel Sanders who was there you know their mascot they brought him back and now sort of to come full circle they have comedians playing Colonel Sanders we is that something you would be interested in doing you know if I am in a totally depends I doubt it but you know I think if things progress the way they've been progressing given time I might have no other choice but to accept that offer if that was to be made now when you're saying but I mean I could also I'd hold out for Kennedy fried chicken I'd be that mascot too I I don't agree with all of her points and I haven't seen every show she's done I know she's on Fox yeah yeah yeah but I mean maybe I hold off I don't think it's I don't think it's named after her Kennedy but her name is Kennedy yeah and she's the only one that's still alive is she a part of that family do you know the Kentucky right Kennedy is Kennedy is she wanted to get probably you know what folks probably the only Kennedy the only Kennedy that should be murdered am I right there's only Kennedy did not be murdered yeah I guess a brain tumor counts as a type of murder yeah I mean if you yeah I mean that that you know God is a murderer in that sense sure yeah hold on one second Adam we're talking about Kennedy from Fox News Adam currently the earbud situation is I have one and I have one now too yeah Adam here yeah you're saying Dave Adam has that no earbud so we were just catching him up on that so obviously you're not a big fan of Fox News how about are you are you like a Bernie Sanders guy or yeah I was you gave up on him or well I don't think he has any viable course to become president I it's not like I gave up on him I I because I'm thinking about voting for him still okay well you that's your prerogative how about this how about this Trump guy you know I mean come on what do you what do you think about him you know I mean I I mean I wouldn't it was so who's your second choice you're going Hillary then if you can't get I I mean part of me is interested in Kennedy you know yeah maybe that's what I was getting at yeah you know a sexy lady president how about that like a kind of a female contrarian yeah that would be cool a sexy lady you probably do you probably do pretty well with the honeys as a celebrity well I'm married so oh yeah like but before you were married um you know I certainly hung out with a bunch of honeys who's the who's the hottest woman you've ever fucked come on stop don't be gross I want to know man everyone wants to know well we're having a political you know you kind of started that honestly I just I made a comment you know there's I'm doing like you didn't even let him answer you know I'm sorry go I'll go ahead mr. Cross I apologize it's alright you know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna really get into that I have too much respect for the women in the past what do you say women in the past you mean oh Alyssa Milano nice nice man that's I beat off the charmed all the time charmed what's the one more embrace of the vampire have you seen that movie no she is she's I didn't hear it definitely said but it I heard the word vampire so I'm definitely oh I haven't seen that she's in a movie I think it's it's embrace of a vampire oh yeah she's completely nude she's also underage in the Joey but a Foucault movie nice which that's just a tidbit I happen to know about her not that's adds any appeal was he saying sure sure he's not saying anything with Adams got it by the way guys I don't have I can't hear I did I just got a dog and I don't know if I should change the dog's name what is the dog's name currently ISIS I wouldn't I mean is it named after the terrorist group or the old TV show at the lady I just she she's from bedside she was like used in dog fights she's a pit bull and my friend rescued her and then he had to get rid of her cuz his landlord wouldn't let him have it so I took it to my apartment and I just call her I see pretty much but you know I don't know I feel like if I change it then the terrorists were to win you know so I don't really know yeah yeah and and it's also gonna give the dog a complex too and it teaches the dog you know exactly that that's a that's you know fear and terror work so you know you can maybe get another you can maybe figure out when you continue to call her ISIS and then if people get upset you can say you know when when the dog is out of your shot you can say oh no her you must have misheard me her name is my sis my sis yeah in the dog park and I said I got a phone call I said I'm training with ISIS right now right yeah you can you could probably see how that might come off he did nice thank you for the input on on that I apologize if that's sort of unrelated we're not gonna ask him about fucking stops are my car got stolen recently and I don't know have you ever had that happen could you please respect I'm sorry but we have hand signals set up so that Adam and Stavros understand when it's appropriate to speak or not and he's just not he's not sorry go ahead ask him about I'm sorry Stavros ask you a question about his fucking car so we'll do that my car got my car got stolen recently I mean I didn't want to but Adam kind of put me on the spot so yeah my car got stolen did that ever happen to you yes that sucks right yeah wasn't the wasn't the greatest thing that happened to me no what kind of car was it a Honda Civic holy shit dude that's I had a mind was a Honda Civic to stop does Honda Civic boys big what color it was a silver 98 maybe it was all you know mine was a 98 did you win when did yours get stolen I don't know um yeah this would have been probably 95 no but what year was the car oh shit I don't know a 93 maybe fuck all right well okay well you're hoping it was the same year whatever yeah that would have been cool if you guys had this thing like imagine if you guys had the same exact type of car and they both happen to get stolen yeah then we I mean we could go to those meetings together I guess what what kind of car do you drive now Toyota Highlander Toyota Highlander that's a great vehicle

we had a great time with that and like we're it's like we're building relationships you know it's kind of cool in the industry man yeah so I guess we're gonna take a break and then come back with the second half we yeah we got to talk about the coop and then we guys not to fucking get your hopes up but we might give a little minister David Cross a call back all right later the grandson of Kwai Chiang Cain walks out of the past so did your great grandfather when he was your age he teaches his son wisdom at a Shaolin temple an evil force destroyed that temple father and son each believed the other had perished 15 years later they were reunited now Cain faced new challenges and his son grew up look I'm not my father I don't do kung fu I'm a cock that's who I am that's what I do I am Cain I will help and we're back ladies in germs oh that was great it was fantastic I was like that was like mark maren level good we didn't think that the with the headphones with only you being able to hear and then stop and I having to switch off who could hear I didn't think it would work but it was pretty seamless honestly yeah we had a positive attitude I think that's really what David you know liked about yeah no I think I think you know he understood they were like young guys trying to make it young alphas on the up-and-coming alpha per nerd alpha per nerd you guys hold on shut the fuck up for a second do you know where alpha perner comes from from Dan bulls ringing no no I mean maybe it does but the reference I'm talking about this week it's not Dan bulls area and it's the fucking guy that shot up those cops and Baton Rouge he invented that dude have you not been paying attention to Cosmo no convos with Cosmo he has he had his own podcast what he was all over social media dude the guy who killed those cops the guy who shot all those cops in Baton Rouge was like a fucking he was like a black Twitter I guess they're called hotep guys which is like an umbrella term from what I can you know tell from context is like an umbrella term for like black people that were like all the Greeks get a Greek gods oh slow down the Greek gods I think you mean the African gods because all the Greeks were actually black oh that's true yeah oh man I can tell you that's excuse me baby black Ludwig von Beethoven I think you mean black big because he was actually a black man you see that's the thing man these these devils they tell you in these schools the George Washington was a white man surprise he was black and he made peanut butter and somebody used to do I think it was who said I think it was Wessel Schmidt used to do that as a bit one of those one of those like edgy like fucking open my guys when I think it was him used to do a bit it's like yeah apparently I found out some fucked up shit about the one of the founding fathers you know they all did racist stuff but apparently George Washington used to like go around in blackface and fuck around with peanuts that's a good bit yeah it's hilarious funny which actually I was on an interesting website the other day black black invention myths dot like time we have to buy that's the only stipulation for using the anthony kumia studios we have to go on that website once a week by the way folks the anthony kumia studios only has one set of headphones in the whole studio studio we're not allowed to use their equipment that's because we're too woke we're in the bathroom at the amphia kumia studio we're in the JV no George Washington Carver didn't invent peanut butter that's not true really yeah no he he did do experiments with peanut butter but like you know he was just a guy and they do that all the time they're like oh fuck we need like a black history guy like how about him right and then they just him always he's I don't know he was a big ass scientist wasn't he like cash-trader some shit I cut his balls off that's what I heard no that was the guy they got they took away his nuts I just did with the truth that's I just cast a truth castrated George Washington Carver that was a Benedict Cumberbatch from the guy's voice when he broke the code his voice is too deep no I really I think I castrated that guy I think I don't know dude I was watching something on YouTube some but I think a hotep guy was behind it so I just ate a pop tart and it ain't agreeing with me we all shared a pop tart and during the break you know what people were very interested in the break music from last time the break did you listen to it I listened to it oh it's because people have been asking me if you're interested it's explosive impact featuring the theme song to the TV show Night Man explosive impact is a rant that some autistic kid uploaded to YouTube like ten years ago and people just kept downloading and re-uploading it night man night man it was a TV show so you know how like superhero movies was your name on Facebook nightmare was put that back in the thing don't lose that shit you're gonna fucking leave it on that chair and lose it I'm doing it but not because you told me to all right no night man was a so you know how we have like this is all this popularity with superhero shit now they tried to do that in the 90s and it failed and they did it with shit like and when I say all the superhero shit I mean like you know Deadpool like no fucking Deadpool is right now Guardians of Galaxy all these like right you know my cut fucking you know comic book shit make it mainstream and they did that in the 90s with the tick I remember to take the Fox show that was good yeah they did it spawned tick was yet well spawn was super popular yeah home is new spawn is the only comic book I've ever read stop is like literally shitting himself he thinks funny but he's gonna shit himself off my he's wearing he's wearing cargo shorts they ain't got no fucking cargoes yeah you keep the turds in them pockets got all them ox your pockets for the turds but no they did that in the 90s with the tick and the shadow and the phantom and Freakazoid yeah free well again Freakazoid you know you know what you're talking about so artistic Nick getting mad yeah well I'm not even a fucking comic book guy it's just like you know read the fucking Wikipedia page man what read every single Wikipedia page readings game that's my stance and you know that yeah I feel the same way but that's why it's a podcast dude you get to listen you don't have to read it that's actually brilliant we should tell us the appeal yeah we should we should transcribe it as a fucking book yeah about night man though oh yeah so night man is about so it was a TV show and night man was a TV show about a guy who he's a jazz musician who got struck by lightning and now he can hear evil and then he also just becomes Batman so he has like all this fucking like tech he can fly all the sudden and he has all this equipment but like that wasn't part of getting struck by lightning I mean I'm sure they explained it but nobody gives a shit right and and the intro music is great and what I loved about the show is like I guess UP I'm pretty sure it was on UPN UPN there's like a period where Dodge was like trying to promote or like all like all these like mopar cars were promoted through television series where they had the new night riders and that was like there was the new Dodge Durango was on that and then they had night man was that the new night rider no it was in the mid 90s it was like night riders there was a night rider reboot in the 90s with all like and I think that we might have all been all fucking like Chrysler vehicles but yeah so it was yeah that was then there was a show called Viper which we have talked about before yeah Viper because that was like the the break music on a couple episodes ago yeah and then on night man night man's car was the Plymouth prowler you remember that that was a beautiful the open-wheel open-wheel layout fucking piece of shit yeah like teardrop car that old guys yeah what were they all purple they were all purple and then in the last model year yeah the last model year they had like yellow but for the first like two or three years the orange yeah it was all are you setting up like a funny bit or are you just no I was talking about something else but you I was explaining one thing and then you interrupt me and I have to expound upon it then you interrupt me again and I get this backlog of shit I need to mention I'm not setting up it we already had David crossing the first half you know what if you don't want to hear me talk about fucking cars then turn off the fucking podcast what's your favorite car my favorite car of all time yeah 1987 Buick GNX why I don't know they're just cool they're cool what do they look like they're cool and like that like you know like 80s like a like a muscle revival sort of way it's like a bunch of big piece of shit old sedans that they had like performance versions of that one's cool the 83 Hearst Cutlass is pretty cool Hearst yeah Hearst they were like a yeah like William Randolph Hearst yeah yeah yeah it's different it's a first like for dead people HRSD no not a Hearst speaking of Hearst we should watch newsies sometime not part of the podcast just newsies newsies as guys just get together and watch newsies only if we see a fucking Broadway play dude yeah well I want to watch the Christian Bale version no I want to watch the movie I want to I want to watch the Christian Bale version before he had muscles so I can obsessively monitor his progress he made the mechanist before he did Batman how you pronounce it the machinist the machinist the machinist I said it right dude I just said it English did the machinist yeah before he did Batman begins and in that movie no it's true he did he did American Psycho before Batman begins he did oh you're right he did the American Psycho then he did machinist machinist he did the Mac there's no okay reason you should be pronouncing it how do you pronounce the pianist is it pianist do you say a dry and Brody and the pianist okay it's first of all it's the penis second of all Adrian Brody and the machinist what's so difficult about words you got a machinist you got Pirates of the Caribbean it's them say say it's the machinist again it's the machinist that would be like a great slogan for like a craft mac and cheese it's the machinist it's the machinist baby with that dinosaur that what dinosaur oh the mac and cheese dinosaur the dinosaur that is as far as I'm concerned gender fluid the the craft mac and cheese dinosaur they never actually tell you what gender the dinosaur is and they do a very good they I think craft like deliberately deliberately obscured the gender of the dinosaur so that everyone would want to fuck it well you know I mean I was a very like forward-thinking company in the 1990s for them to do that craft craft yeah but no what were we talking about I don't fucking Adam you're saying oh so he was in the machinist and can I have the bottom half of that pop tart it's gone saw it he farted it first of all motherfuckers after I had the least amount of pop tart here right well let's just get that straight for the listeners I love that the rapper that pop tarts come in this is like it's like still yeah well it's like yeah it's like this like very thin tinfoil but it's plastic it's like the shit that the astronaut stuff like it looks like it belongs like like it's yeah I like how everything NASA ever made just wound up a sharper image at some point yeah yeah I heard they didn't even eat ice cream that's really like yeah why are they so smart dude if they just NASA yeah it's they just had fancy mattresses and like you know shut up NASA yo and NASA stop fucking listen to my phone calls without my permission dude fuck you all right yo oh yeah so you got this place called NASA NASA they like listen to phone calls emails this brother named n-word snowman my man n-word snowman be telling people in NASA Paul Mooney and Ralph should have their own TV show yeah it is some good shit yeah so anyway Christian Bale was in the machinist and he lost all this weight for this movie right he gets super skinny in it and he like locked himself in a hotel is just smoking cigarettes and chewing gum to get down to that weight and drinking water he actually ate a can of tuna and an apple a day bitch that's it that's all he ate you have to eat something you gotta eat something yeah no all he was eating was a can of tuna and an apple every day holy shit and he got down to like 110 pounds or something psycho 110 and then like six months later he showed up for production on Batman Begins like Jack 225 Jack like he had so many steroids well it's not that he did steroids I mean steroids can only do so much for you it's that like he had already been jacked prior to that movie coming out prior to the the machinist mm-hmm so he lost all that weight and then like went to put the weight back on and like you still have like you know I mean your body's just readjusting to where it was so it's like he had some sort of tragedy happen you know he got lost at sea right and his body like rehab itself mm-hmm but like a regular person I don't think he'd gain that much weight in like seven months I think you could yeah you should try it dude you should you get jacked he just got Adam just tell him about the deal you got dude we're actually sponsored by optimum nutrition now so I got a optimum nutrition weight gainer on Amazon Prime day it's called serious mass and folks the serious part means fucking serious yeah it's 1300 calories per serving yeah scoop you per scoop that's a no no it's two scoops in a cell that's a fucking chipotle burrito in a half

what's funny is you see that like the social justice tweets that he was retweeting over the last couple of weeks and they're the same tweets that like your friends like your friends and his like opinions and shit are identical to you know people that are loud on social media but hey he was the guy with courage he finally did something about it you know I mean everybody can talk yeah it's one thing to be an out look an alpha has a gun okay but an alphapreneur murders the police you got to take the initiative you got to think okay I got a gun what can I do with this gun defend myself beta how about I invent a new way to use the gun did he have like a company other than like promoting himself like what was he an entrepreneur of just fucking dude he's out there he's fucking like selling you know waste trainers I told you about that guy I knew from from Tony told me about this guy from high school he caught up with who's like yo I got a lifestyle brand he called like mcdavids or something yes and basically it was like two t-shirts like streetwear kind of t-shirt a lifestyle that he's still he's a good story he sells online for like 120 bucks you know for this shitty t-shirt and anyway he had an Instagram account up and basically two t-shirts and maybe stickers that he put on like right he's like hashtag pole hashtag lifestyle brand hashtag you know so anyway McDonald's finds out about I wasn't mcdavids I was something with mcd something and they find out about it they're like well it's our policy typically to buy all registered trademarks and brands that start mcd hitting so they like made him like a $40,000 off what and he looked them squarely I and said I'm gonna have to pass are you fucking joking holy shit you know that guy's at a bar being like yeah they came me they tried to buy but not my baby yeah I'm gonna make it big with mcd's yo there's a lifestyle brand bro you know we got t-shirts stickers got tank tops coming soon you remember you remember Chris Barillac yeah Chris Barillac was this nerd comedian in DC it was he lives in San Francisco before everyone was a fucking nerd comedian oh yeah he was the guy oh fuck we're all drinking a sparkling drink in bubbly water but yeah Chris Barillac Chris Barillac he was like the nerd comedian in DC before that was a thing truly like any that is who that guy is because DC 10 years ago half the comedians were like black eyes were Kangol hats and I knew I remember he's a day they used to stand right over there and I was staying over here and those were the days man that's how I went down yeah I was staying right here I was staying right here me and him with boys but you know I didn't I never looked him in the eye he was 14 sometimes Tony Woods called me a faggot but that was it but yeah so yeah Chris he would like he would grab the microphone with both hands and all of his jokes would be and then to the all the way to the fucking castle where the princess is like the punchline was always some you know rant or whatever I was friends with them but he was you know like fully autistic you know like a nerd and there was no reason no no there's a point to it ties into this lifestyle brand thing is there was a show called Beauty and the geek that came out yeah and Chris at the time was running a thing called the geeks of comedy it was like a tour he did like I do geek comedy I'm a geek and I make geek jokes for geeks and they like performed it like comic-con and shit like that was the image he put forward and Beauty and the Geek it was like this reality show and on the show they make the geeks to stand up as like part of the show whoa and you know and then you they pair you with like a really fucking hot woman yeah to fuck and the geeks don't look bad at all I mean that's like the theme of the show it wasn't like mean-spirited and they approached Chris and they were like you'd be perfect for the show and he's like I just don't want to be known for that and it's like that you already are you fucking idiot and he like he turned it down that's crazy he turned it down and then they asked him again they like came back and asked him again they turned it down again do you ever talk about on the part about that dude you know with the t-shirt company with the hot chick with oh yeah I was some guy I went to high school with he had like he's like fucking I don't know he just didn't really do much in college and got some bullshit degree and then I think he like yeah I guess eventually graduated with like a graphic design degree and so he started like a t-shirt company and his t-shirts are online they're all fucking like yeah I mean they're just you know it's the same bullshit was like Marilyn Monroe or something yeah yeah that was it one of them was like it was like a fucking but she had face tattoos no it was like a fucking it wasn't Marilyn Monroe who was it was Audrey Hepburn hell yeah is Audrey Hepburn smoking a cigarette and then the fucking the title of the shirt and it's just a picture of her and then screen printed yeah and it just it's called like a chick with sick yeah that's great yeah I wish I knew how to screen print actually that's like good for like merch on the road we could learn no you can't I tried what do you mean I mean I can't I tried I looked at you know I got a fucking my roommate had a screen printer and I tried to figure out how to do that shit it's difficult hmm why are we not why do we keep losing the issue here which is Cosmo is Cosmo Cosmo Cosmo I gave you so much gold in your life fucking oh what about this other thing what about this turkey coop yeah turkey coop you know what I always saw was crazy did check this out I'm listening they got a country called Turkey uh-huh they got another one called hungry hmm put those together yeah it seems like we solve all the world yeah we'll have full yeah stomach in one country a half eaten turkey other country yeah who gets that whoo which one of us is gonna be using that in our act we'll do rock-paper-scissors for it after this rock-paper-scissors you know it's like the rock would beat paper yeah you just fucking we'll cover it you cover it that's not beating it you cover it sorry that's like please don't stop rock just don't do it stop destroying all the scissors yeah stop for you bitch that feels like it'd be like I kind of like a Pete Holmes II sort of I think it's I think it's out there did somebody do I think that fits out yeah this is why I fucking open my comedy sucks all stand-up sucks stand-ups pretty much dead stand-up sucks Twitter Twitter pretty much replaced doing open mics for me Twitter five years ago mm-hmm yeah I could see that because all those dumb does dumb fucking like jokes that you would want to do at an open mic when you have two minutes right and you want to say something fucking retarded right right yeah that's what Twitter's for yeah I don't know you can okay so let's let's do a thing where we go around the room right now and we all say I'm new funny joke idea that we have you want to start you start okay I got an idea all right there is okay so there's two different types of black people third black all right what's the second one seriously this is my man said my man well okay if you if you doing a voice go ahead and drop me and bomb that's the old man somebody found out that it's a character this is a good search on Twitter and then you type in you search for an asterisk asterisk asterisk a and it's all fucking white people being like where my niggazette they censor it like no it's wrong yeah but then they do it anyways that's pretty good some extremely good shit it is that's good stuff I love saying the n-word yeah I'd like to have the podcast come to just Peter out just Peter I gotta start off with David Cross we used all our energy preparing for that god that was an emotional rollercoaster also oh we should let you guys know the coffee machine at the Anthony Kumia Studios is broken yeah fuck yeah if CPXI wants to get on there she'll say the fucking companies sorry if the company whose studios I use without them what they're not gonna listen to it you're right but just don't they got just blowing popcorn out my company my company for man children where they have rock band in the break room please don't shit on my employer mr. Mullen so they used to be my employer so I'm allowed to shit on me too yo this company fucking fired me get this for being too smart that was the only thing you did wrong they didn't want you to be the boss that's a problem they're just they were threatened they say he's incompetent but you know the truth is he got too much knowledge actually I heard Bill Cosby was gonna buy NBC I don't know if you that's the reason yeah taking him down he was gonna buy NBC he was rich enough oh I see what happens when he gets to bow I can't stop doing that character fucking the conspiracy theory black I can be such a shitty comic if you're a black guy yeah you go you can be like such and it's like high energy come full circle now we're like a shitty comic as a white guy yeah but not with the level of success I think like you can straight up just be you can be a road dog as a white guy be a shitty yeah yeah that's true you can work the like you can middle for 20 years who wants to do that but you could be a you could straight up here's the thing there are so many guys just doing Richard Pryor's act oh yeah it's like 70 years it's like ridiculous like oh this is why guys like honey I think we need to go home and do our taxes honey you know you don't just be homophobic yeah straight up homophobic we talked about that on the last one oh that's right yeah but now man imagine I wish I like that's I'm envious that's a type privilege in my mind oh yeah just meeting hack privilege there was like six months in comedy where everyone had a bane joke we're talking about what's his name Alex Alex star oh geez he always had a bane part of his yeah I'm out on this boys you're gonna beat you up you're gonna stop being worried about people beating you up stop I'm strong you got to go to the

like podcast numbers you guys so you keep doing this there's only like 13 people that's a thing you ever see a guy see the numbers I said like have a podcast and it's clearly because they need someone to hang out with them yeah oh yeah dude yeah that's just straight up catching up yeah so I don't know it's like kind of a boring weekend there's so many bought bad podcasts and like ours some of them

like,\"},{\"currTime\":238,\"text\":\"wasn't like a bit, like a pest bit\"},{\"currTime\":241,\"text\":\"to like blow a fucking air horn\"},{\"currTime\":243,\"text\":\"in like a local news reporter's ear.\"},{\"currTime\":245,\"text\":\"No, that was the one that ended that bit actually.\"},{\"currTime\":248,\"text\":\"They got sued, yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":249,\"text\":\"He says, yeah, let's make somebody fucking deaf.\"},{\"currTime\":253,\"text\":\"Yeah, it was just about being stupid\"},{\"currTime\":254,\"text\":\"and getting their name out there.\"},{\"currTime\":255,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":256,\"text\":\"And they're, when the show ended,\"},{\"currTime\":259,\"text\":\"people really did split down the middle\"},{\"currTime\":261,\"text\":\"because it was frustrating for them\"},{\"currTime\":262,\"text\":\"to see this thing that they love so much gone.\"},{\"currTime\":266,\"text\":\"Like one day it was there, and one day it was gone.\"},{\"currTime\":269,\"text\":\"And then when Opie and myself didn't go with Anthony,\"},{\"currTime\":272,\"text\":\"that's when a lot of the anger came out.\"},{\"currTime\":274,\"text\":\"Like they were angry immediately that we didn't quit.\"},{\"currTime\":276,\"text\":\"Yeah, right.\"},{\"currTime\":277,\"text\":\"Which contractually we couldn't have.\"},{\"currTime\":278,\"text\":\"We would have gotten sued by Sirius.\"},{\"currTime\":280,\"text\":\"And then when we re-upped with Sirius\"},{\"currTime\":282,\"text\":\"and didn't go with Ant,\"},{\"currTime\":283,\"text\":\"I always kind of held out a secret hope\"},{\"currTime\":285,\"text\":\"that there would be some kind of reconciliation.\"},{\"currTime\":289,\"text\":\"But as time went on, it became apparent\"},{\"currTime\":291,\"text\":\"that it would not be.\"},{\"currTime\":292,\"text\":\"But the thing I don't understand about the side-taking thing\"},{\"currTime\":294,\"text\":\"is like, have you never had a group of friends in your life?\"},{\"currTime\":298,\"text\":\"I mean, everybody, anybody I know knows somebody\"},{\"currTime\":301,\"text\":\"that, or knows two different people\"},{\"currTime\":303,\"text\":\"that fucking hate each other.\"},{\"currTime\":304,\"text\":\"Sure.\"},{\"currTime\":304,\"text\":\"And they can be friends with both of them.\"},{\"currTime\":306,\"text\":\"And that's like a social dynamic\"},{\"currTime\":307,\"text\":\"that everyone has to navigate.\"},{\"currTime\":308,\"text\":\"And then these people just don't understand that.\"},{\"currTime\":310,\"text\":\"I think what bothers them is they looked at it like,\"},{\"currTime\":314,\"text\":\"these guys are very, and I mean,\"},{\"currTime\":315,\"text\":\"see these guys meaning me too,\"},{\"currTime\":317,\"text\":\"are very real people.\"},{\"currTime\":318,\"text\":\"They tell us how things are for them\"},{\"currTime\":320,\"text\":\"and they tell us what life is or how they see life.\"},{\"currTime\":323,\"text\":\"And then all of a sudden this, as you said,\"},{\"currTime\":325,\"text\":\"skizzing, this thing happens,\"},{\"currTime\":327,\"text\":\"and it's not the way they saw it.\"},{\"currTime\":329,\"text\":\"They're like, these fucking guys were fake.\"},{\"currTime\":331,\"text\":\"They didn't tell us that they didn't like each other.\"},{\"currTime\":334,\"text\":\"They acted like everything was okay.\"},{\"currTime\":336,\"text\":\"To me, I mean, I was there every day.\"},{\"currTime\":337,\"text\":\"So I saw a lot of it.\"},{\"currTime\":339,\"text\":\"But there were things that came out afterwards\"},{\"currTime\":340,\"text\":\"that I wasn't even aware of.\"},{\"currTime\":342,\"text\":\"You know, I didn't know

Some guy came up to us, and he was like, I really, really like the podcast. And I was like, oh, shit, we shouldn't be saying that word. Yeah, our fans. We're offending our fans. Yeah, you'd be surprised. No matter what group you think, they don't listen. Like fucking eight of them come up to you to show you, Oh my God, I can't believe I made fun of one leg of Jews. Why would I do that? You can't, so you have to just kind of write it off and go, I'm gonna bother some people saying this because there's no way they're never gonna hear you. Yeah. Have you had a one-legged Jew experience? A lot. Yeah? That's cool. Do you get a lot of hate on Twitter and stuff? Oh yeah. Yeah, sure. But it is what it is. I mean, it's funny with Twitter and social media because a lot of them come off like they're these hardcore critics and this and that, but it's like a lot of them are just literally, they need the same thing college students need with safe space. Yeah, right. Because they can't just come out and they've gotten mad at me when I've said I despise their anonymity, I don't respect it. Because it's like, look, we're not in fucking communist China, all right? You're not criticizing the regime where you're gonna be thrown in jail. You just want the safe space. You wanna weigh in, but you don't wanna weigh in as yourself. So I get a lot of it, but I kind of take it with a grain of salt. But it doesn't mean that it's not legit criticism either. Like I did the chip animation and some people really loved it and a lot of people hated it. And you have to weed through hateful comments. Like, cause a lot of them are just being cunts, but some of them made great points. So you have to like weed through and go, okay, well that was a really smart criticism. They're right, this didn't capture Bob or whatever. You know what I mean? But let's say between reading that, you have to read, you're a fucking piece of shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like dude, all you had to say was this is why I didn't like it and I actually would have given weight to what you just said. Yeah. Well, I feel like, I mean, half of those people are just mad about that, the schism though and a schism. Oh, that's a tremendous part of it. Yeah. I don't understand taking sides with like the end of two grown men's friendship. Yeah. It's a weird thing, you know, it's like, that's basically what it is to get divorced and they're really mad. Well, dad gave me a better birthday last year. So I like his house more. They look at it like, and I can only speak from what I've heard from them. But a lot of them come from a place of like, this was a show that, it was a different fan base. It was a very aggressive fan base. Yeah. Well, I remember when it was taunting. When I was a teenager, it was like, wasn't like a bit, like a pest bit to like blow a fucking air horn in like a local news reporter's ear. No, that was the one that ended that bit actually. They got sued, yeah. He says, yeah, let's make somebody fucking deaf. Yeah, it was just about being stupid and getting their name out there. Yeah. And they're, when the show ended, people really did split down the middle because it was frustrating for them to see this thing that they love so much gone. Like one day it was there, and one day it was gone. And then when Opie and myself didn't go with Anthony, that's when a lot of the anger came out. Like they were angry immediately that we didn't quit. Yeah, right. Which contractually we couldn't have. We would have gotten sued by Sirius. And then when we re-upped with Sirius and didn't go with Ant, I always kind of held out a secret hope that there would be some kind of reconciliation. But as time went on, it became apparent that it would not be. But the thing I don't understand about the side-taking thing is like, have you never had a group of friends in your life? I mean, everybody, anybody I know knows somebody that, or knows two different people that fucking hate each other. Sure. And they can be friends with both of them. And that's like a social dynamic that everyone has to navigate. And then these people just don't understand that. I think what bothers them is they looked at it like, these guys are very, and I mean, see these guys meaning me too, are very real people. They tell us how things are for them and they tell us what life is or how they see life. And then all of a sudden this, as you said, skizzing, this thing happens, and it's not the way they saw it. They're like, these fucking guys were fake. They didn't tell us that they didn't like each other. They acted like everything was okay. To me, I mean, I was there every day. So I saw a lot of it. But there were things that came out afterwards that I wasn't even aware of. You know, I didn't know exactly how OP felt. There were times where he said things were good and there were times where he said things were bad. So I think the fans, if I'm sitting there and I'm not 100% sure, like there's been a couple of things that have happened in the time since the show ended that surprised me. But then the fans also have to be realistic too. It's like Keith Richards and Mick Jagger really don't like each other. You know, they kissed and didn't like each other for years. Ozzy and Sabbath, it didn't get along at one point. It's how it is in a creative collaboration. The difference is when you're hearing music, you're not hearing real opinions on a real-time daily basis. You're not hearing guys, you're not hearing the fucking recording sessions with them yelling at each other. So it's just a different dynamic with talk radio, man. Fans get very attached to it. But the only thing that bothers me about the fans' reaction is the way they've kind of turned on the three of us. And it's like, man, we made you laugh for fucking 10 years. The guys that hated us all along, that's different. But it's like all of a sudden to have such vitriolic anger towards guys that made you, like I've been pissed off at people who I enjoyed too. But I didn't get that vengefully angry at them. I guess it's kind of like a finding out, like wrestling is fake sort of thing. But it wasn't a fake dynamic. It was, I mean, what you saw, I mean, we were trying to be funny. And there was a lot of it they saw before it ended too. But yeah, maybe it is along those lines. They just feel deceived to a certain point. But you know, it's like, I have to let more of my personal life hang out than fucking almost anybody in showbiz. Like, what do you want? Like, that's what bothers me. It's like, what do you fucking guys want? Like, I've told you more about myself than most performers would have ever told you about themselves. I told you to be funny. I told you in times when there was a slow news day, you know what I mean? I just started spitting shit out. Hey, sorry if I let you down. What do you want me to tell you? Yeah. Half of you don't even use your real names when you yell at us. I've told you things that most guys would never have told you. That's like a funny comparison to like the band thing. You know, like I always have had a lot of respect for like the Brian Setzer Orchestra that he could manage all those people that that band didn't break up. You have that many people and they never had an issue. Well, they had never had a visible issue. I'm sure they had them. Yeah. But you know, how many musicians are there in that band? I don't even know. It's a whole orchestra. Yeah. They've got that together. Do you think like Philharmonic orchestras have like first chair violin has a heroin problem? Yeah. And the kick amount. And the fucks the tuba players? Yeah. The fucks the tuba players' wife? Yeah. It probably happens all the time and they just boot it and you never know. It's just another jerk off in a tux. There's no attachment. There's no attachment to those people. So you'll never see them coming and going. Yeah. You know? Yeah. I would love to see a showboating like cello player. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You gotta keep it together. You get no more, I don't know, fucking, just comes in. Makeup. I don't just like spandex. See, I don't know shit about the orchestra. I'm sorry I took this in this direction. I'm really reaching here. Yeah. I have no ties, violins. That's all I really understand. I had cello, that was it. Yeah. I had tuba. I don't think tubas are in orchestras, but I said it. I'm sure they're all once in a while. Yeah. Maybe that's where the rift is. You know what I mean? Maybe one guy shows up with a tuba because he's better at that and they're like, we don't need this, whatever it just happened. That's how marching bands started. They literally walked out, just didn't stop, just kept going. Sorry I'm clear on my throat so much, just fucking, I realize it's coffee that does it to me. It's not, I don't drink dairy at all, so it's like, ugh, that fucking thing you get, it's caffeine, I gotta quit caffeine. Yeah, you're like a big, you're like a diet and exercise guy now, right? Yeah, but I've been eating like shit lately, so I get self-hatred immediately. So over like 10 years ago, you were never like fat, but you were like- I was, I was a fucking pig. You were fat, you were like round. I'll show you my driver's license photo. I was an oinker. I was like fucking, yeah. I would say fat, yeah, as a fat man. I feel like I could, yeah. I was, I was like really? I was like, I was probably around the same weight you were, or like the same, like when I was like 17, I was like a little bit heavier, but I was like, I'm not fat. So, yeah, I don't know, what motivated that? When we were doing Tough Crowd back in like, this was like 2002, me and Nick DiPallo had an argument in the, you know, in far be it from Nick to say something caustic, but we were in the writers room fighting. He's like, ah, you fat fuck. And when he said that, I was like, oh my God, that's something people use at me now when they're mad. I must have really put a lot of weight on it. And I still fluctuated up and down for years after that. It was a couple of years ago, I just got sick of it. But I found, I was looking through my old hard drive last night, trying to find something to jerk off to that I'd saved. And I saw a picture of myself actually on camera with Janine Garofalo for the first Tough Crowd. I was so fucking fat. We taped those first eight in November of 2002. And I remember, I think I was in four of the first eight and oh, was I fucking horrible. That was like almost at my fat. So it was probably like 175 at that point. I think I hit 181 at one point, if I remember right now. Yeah, that's kind of fat, I guess, yeah. Take that back. That's hilarious, yeah. That would be pretty big. What was your, what was your fat guy vice? Did you have a specific thing that you did that you just went crazy on? Food, you mean? No, it was everything. So I quit smoking in 2001. So I think that was where I just started eating more. And now I wasn't exercising. I was doing this thing for a long time when we got kicked off the radio, which was again, 2002, 2003, where I was watching the Sopranos and eating fruit until four in the morning. I'd go to the diner and get this giant fruit plate with what comes with fruit cottage cheese. That's shit. And I didn't realize that that was all fattening and sugar. Fuck man. Well, that sucks. Wow, getting fat from fruit is horrific. That's the worst way to do it. That was just one way to do it. I mean, there was other stuff I was eating there. That was just, I thought it was like thinking I was being healthy at two o'clock in the morning. Well, that is pretty healthy. Cottage cheese is like a great, you know, post-sleep or pre-sleep meal. Sugar keeps you up all night. It was really awful. Yeah, the sugar. Yeah, I guess that's probably bad for you. I tried to get, I tried to be healthy by ordering a salad yesterday. And I was like, oh, like a chicken salad. And it was just like, I just ordered from a place I'd never gotten. It was like four pieces of lettuce and just a chicken cutlet on top of it. And I was like, well, I guess I ate a salad today. Yeah, you gotta ask for grilled chicken. Yeah, you gotta ask. So I'm the white of vegan, tell me. You're fucking worse than me when I order. I'm horrible. I order everything exactly how I want it. I went to Joe's by the stand at a fucking place. And I was like, could I get like just a chicken salad? And the guy was like, would like a, what do you mean like a chicken salad? I'm like, yeah, no, yeah, that's literally, yeah, that's what I said. Yeah, let me get a chicken salad. He's like, oh, okay, I guess. And he was like, weird about it. I was like, what the fuck was that? And then they bring the, and it was chicken salad. It wasn't like a chicken salad with mayonnaise. And it was a giant scoop, like the size of a half of fucking basketball on the plate. And they're like, yeah, it's like $13. He thought I just wanted like a, you know, three pounds of chicken salad. A handful of chickens. I'll just put it in my hand, please. I'll just take a fucking mayonnaise. No, you gotta ask for a regular salad and say I want grilled chicken on it. That's how you gotta order that. Cause chicken salad, they're bringing that fucking, like you said, that scoop of mayo, it sucks. This is excellent content. I know, it really is. I know. We're just chatting about the fucking things. Three fucking hens. Yeah. Fetching about our weight. Oh, I don't know. It goes right to my hips. I try the fruit salad. It's delightful. We really should be killed. Well, I don't know. I guess it's just weird to think that like, cause you seem like, you know, very like, not obsessive, but like detail oriented and you got to schedule and you got to like, you know, keep things going all the time. So the weight fitness stuff and like the diet stuff makes sense in the context of your personality now. I don't, like, what was your thing before diet and exercise? I was up, I mean, you know, I was, I, as much as I talk about escorts and stuff, I really don't do that much at this point. But back then, man, I was in stermanic depression. I was doing like fucking dominatrixes every night, escorts every night, to, you know, till three o'clock in the morning. We did afternoons when I was in an MEW. So I was not a morning person. Right. I would have bed at six in the morning, seven in the morning, get up at two or three in the afternoon. Tough crowd taped at three. So we'd get the topics. I'd write the night before we, I'd get up at like noon at the fucking earliest and then kind of go sluggish to work. So it's like, there was no time to exercise. After that, it'll be right to work and do gigs and up all night again. So now getting up in the morning kind of helps you be more regimented in life. So that's why I hate it, but I like it for that reason. I feel like a real person. Cause you quit drinking like young. I was 18, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you regret that at all? No, no, no. Regret quitting. I do, I do. I've been sober for a couple of years and I don't know why. I don't understand why I'm doing it. There's times where I was like, hey, smoke and power would be fun. But I learned from the people who, is that too loud that thing? No, I'm not. You sure? There's times where I crave it. Like, wow, that'd be fun. But then I look at people who are wrecking their careers with it and I'm like, no, it wouldn't be. Cause I'm the guy who wrecks his career. Joe Rogan fucking eats pot and then practices jujitsu. I'm not that guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not the guy that fucking eats pot and then succeeds. I'm the guy who smokes pot and does nothing. I don't really have a career to wreck. So, I mean, it's kind of just like, you know, I just haven't had fun in the last three and a half years. I guess things have gone better for me. Things are definitely better. You used to live with a clown rape victim from the army in a closet in Baltimore. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Remember that? That was your life. You worked at a, you were a part time, what were you, a telemarketer for a symphony? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, no, what? You don't think your life is better since you quit drinking? No, no, I look worse for not knowing shit about the orchestra when I actually. Oh, yeah, you're a telemarketer. I worked for the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. I was like a telefunder for them. I worked in the basement at nights and I would like call old people and beg them for money for the orchestra. Oh my God. Yeah, and I lived with a, I lived with a clown that had PTSD from when he was raped in the army. So, he would like fucking wake up in the middle of the night, hyperventilating and screaming and throwing his clown shit all over the fucking, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh. Yeah. Who raped him? Another clown, I guess. He was in clown college. There was other soldiers. That was the story, yeah. Wow. He rushed a clown fraternity and they raped him. And it's shitty, I know, like, you know, believe victims or whatever, but I don't think it, it just didn't make sense. Yeah, there's times where victims are lying too. I mean, just because they're victims, or they say they're a victim. You know, everyone's not a victim just because they say they are. Yeah, I mean, the story, the way he told it is like, he was coming out of surgery at like age 47 and he like, one of the orderlies in the hospital looked creepy and then he had like a flashback to like, oh yeah, when I was in the army, I got raped. But there's, you know, repressed memories is kind of like a bunk science. A lot of that's just like the suggestion, you know, on the part of a therapist or whatever. It can be, yeah. Although I know cases where it's really come back, you know, where your mind shuts down and fucking, because you're protecting the person, protecting someone who abused you or whatever, or protecting yourself from it. It's a good time for my fuck. You do that bit though, about your friend with the star, what was it, the Star Wars cards or the Star Wars toys? Oh yeah, my friend who got, I think molested by the fucking security guard and he pulled his dick out to show him that he didn't have any Star Wars, that's a true story. He came back with the Star Wars Corvettes, white trash department store in New Jersey. And I just forgot it for years. But I didn't repress that or wipe it out. It might just be unpleasant or scary and I walked away from it. I wasn't the one who was abused. He didn't ask to see my dick. He asked to see my friend's dick. Well, it's like the Satanic ritual abuse, like scandals in the 80s. You know, they have all these kids where they're like, and then did he, you know, like, and you can say no, but did he bend you over and fuck you in the ass and pull your hair, you know? And then the kid's like, yes, they're just like playing with a truck and not even looking at the investigator. And like, most of those people recanted. But there was like, if you watch Capturing the Freedmen's, I think there's like one guy that's like, no, he did it. He's still convinced that it happened. Yeah, that's a very weird thing with repressed memories and childhood, like the McMartin preschool. You know what I mean? It was a whole thing was a... I don't know that story. Oh, it's a really huge story. Look up the McMartin preschool with the power of suggestion. A bunch of kids said that these teachers molested them. In hindsight, it looks like they really didn't. Yeah. Well, that's what, yeah, but this case, did you see Capturing the Freedmen's? I did, yeah. One of those guys was a comedy teller one night. Oh, really? One of the victims or one of the Freedmen's? One of the Freedmen's. Oh. Okay. I think. Did you ask him if he did it? Don't remember. I don't remember. I mentioned him. It would be great if you just conspired with everyone in there that was there that night to be like, he raped all of us. He came in and he raped everybody. He came to the cellar. I don't think we knew he was there when I was on. Or I don't remember if I knew he was on. God fucking did. Do you guys talk? I'm gonna open my dryer, my washer thing, because that's gonna beep and annoy this shit out of me. Look at the, look at Mr. Where's Clothes over here. Yeah, it's got his own washer. Clothes, so how do you feel about this stuff? How's it going? Pretty good. I think, you know, we could pick it up probably. I wanna ask about Dominatrix's probably next in a second. That would be a good idea. We could do that. Always talk more about Brachy. We probably could have gotten more into Baltimore. That weird period of time in Baltimore, where you were a big time alcoholic and you were... I mean, I was a big time alcoholic, you know, for years probably. Yeah, well, that's, but I knew you then when you were... Yeah. You know, there's plenty of... This is a nice little mid-podcast check-in. It is a good mid-podcast check-in. This apartment is so nice. I'm like, just so relaxed. We usually do it in your shitty office, you know, where I'm thinking about getting all that free cereal. That woman so badly wanted to kick me out. Oh, yeah, yeah. Excuse me, who are you here with? She asked me that like three times. They barely want me there. Yeah. You know what I mean? Who is this? He has this fucking dumb job at this office in Midtown. So you can tell, I'm like... Yeah, I work for this company. They're trying to do a comedy, they're trying to launch a comedy site, but the rest of it is all clickbait. Like they all do, you know, just the worst parts of the internet. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're just, you know, ripping off anything that's successful. They just do their own version. And it makes, the sad part is that's what makes the most money. It does, right? It's original content. It's just taking other ideas and retreading them. But most of the people there are just like, you know, it's coders, it's advertising people, it's like professional people, and it's like... Yeah, the company, the company is like, what are they, their main thing is like programmatic ad sales or something. Yeah, exactly. It's an advertising company. And then, you know, I think what their main thing is they find like media outlets or websites and then they tailor like ad content for those sites. But then to make more money, they said, well, why don't we have our own proprietary sites and then put the ads on there. And then one of them is like an onion or like, yeah. And then they're turning into comedy, but whatever. What matters is that most of the people that are, like, you know, real people with real fucking jobs and shit. And then we come in, everyone's around with dog t-shirts and Mullins wearing a Mountain Dew sleeveless T. And they're just trying to kick us out. We do the podcast there and it's like, clearly we don't belong there. Clearly this is, you know, we're the people that are just working for the comedy site and doing a cum podcast in one of their conference rooms. But I'm surprised with the internet and stuff. There's so many people that work on it that don't wear a suit entirely. I'm surprised that I'm used to that dynamic of, you know, somebody who's a different or odd coming in. I mean, it's just, it's not that uncommon with the fucking web. Yeah, well, it's mostly because like I'm screaming in the kitchen or whatever. She got mad at me because Adam said that like, Adam told this story about, he's like the other guy we do this podcast with. Adam was like watching, well fuck, cause now his friends listen, I can't, I can't tell his story. Well, whatever. He said he overheard like some girl, he's watching like Game of Thrones with some girl and the episode ends and then the girl was like, it's just so cool that we like all get to be a part of this like cultural event together. It's like a cultural movement. She's referring to Game of Thrones. It's like a cultural movement. And then, you know, we were like making fun of her in the kitchen or whatever. And I was like, yeah, like, you know how like, Dr. Martin Luther King wrote Game of Thrones and the receptionist is, it was like, she's like a black lady. And I saw her like fucking snap and look at me as soon as I said Dr. Martin Luther King. You're just taking free cereal at six PM. You're loading up on their breakfast cereal that they have there and eating and drinking coffee. Oh, that's special K they have there. And she asked me like three times, she's like, who are you here with? Does he know you're here? And it always kicked me out. I want to ask you this about, cause you know about like I guess, well prostitutes and stuff, cause somebody told me, do you know what Finn Dom is? Financial Elimination. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Somebody told me yesterday that that's not real. Like a grizzled vet, but there's no real market for it. But people do that for real. There are of course these guys that I used to date at Dominatrix. There are guys that love that. They are, they absolutely is real. I'm not saying it's a big fetish, but there's a lot of guys that love opening their wallet. It's probably more wishful thinking on the part of the Dominatrixes too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But there are guys that love that type of humiliation. I don't get it at all. I don't do it. I think it's stupid. Right. I'm tactile. You know, I need a fucking ass on my face. I got to smell it. That's how most people are. Yeah. It's coming. That's what I don't get about like when at Dominatrix, it's like they just like treat you bad. And then look, do whatever you want at first. Treat me like shit, whatever. But at some point I want to come. Sure. That's where. Well at the end of the day with the Finn Dom shit, you're still beating off. And if you're beating off, then it's like a fantasy. And then it's like, why don't you just fantasize about someone taking your money? It's not enough anymore. Keep the money. No, it's progressions. Not enough. How come you don't just drink one beer? Well, because eight is what I need now. That's how it is with this shit. It doesn't feel good anymore. Got to keep up in the ante a little bit, a little bit. Got to do this. Finn Dom does nothing for me. I don't get it. I mean, I get it, but it's stupid to me. Yeah. No, because there's this girl that hates Kurt, went after Kurt, who just like it's not job internet person. And she does Finn Dom now, I guess, because she couldn't get a job writing. But yeah, someone was telling me that there's no way that she actually has a job doing that, because no one will. Well, she does financial domination. But online, where she just like texts you like, fuck you, pig. And then apparently men give her money for that. What? Yeah, it's a weird thing with there are guys that like to be, like if you would have told me at one point in my life that I would never get turned on by a woman putting her feet in my face while I jerked off, I would have thought you were nutty. So you grew into feet. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I never liked my ex-girlfriend who was Dominatrix, a beautiful size, eight feet. Never cared about them. I never. It was something that happened after. Recent development. Yeah, it was one of those things where you just get bored and you move on. So financial domination is probably one of those things where guys who love just having hookers say open your wallet with Dominatrix and say open your fucking wallet worthless, lick my feet worthless. Just a way of feeling worthless and used and shitty. Probably guys like judges and fucking hedge fund guys that get whatever they want. That's weird. And now I have to worry about that, that I might turn into one of those guys. My dad, at age like 60, got into trains. And it was so fucking embarrassing. Hope you don't want to be the middle. Yeah. Two darker studs. Well, no, I'm really like, he's like 63rd birthday. And he's like, yeah, my wife took me up to some bullshit town in Pennsylvania to go see a train. And then he's like, got videos of the train on his phone. I swear to God, I thought you meant threesomes. No, no. I swear to God, I thought you meant threesomes. Why would I be ashamed of that? It's more embarrassing to be into art. Yeah, look at that. Lionel trains, yeah. Yeah, no, if you came like a railroad fan at age 63, after like I had spent 15 years making fun of those people on the internet. Your dad turned autistic at 63. And those are just in your genes. He just likes to look at trains. He just likes trains. Yeah, he likes enjoys looking at trains. Oh, man, one time I like, he used to wake up. So his wife doesn't let him do anything. He's not allowed to have like France. And one time he used to wake up at like 3.45, 4 o'clock in the morning and like go out into like where his laptop is by the kitchen area in the apartment and like quietly look at model cars on eBay, like slot cars and stuff that he wasn't allowed to buy. His wife wouldn't let him have anything. But he would just look at these collectibles that he would have if he could. But he had to sneak out into the computer area to do that. Why? I don't know, because it's life shit. You don't like her? No, she's great actually. She was a nightmare when I was a teenager. But like now that I'm an adult and she doesn't have any control over me, she's a lot of fun. Right. She's like, we went to my grandmother's funeral like two months ago. And she's like, you know, well, I got to stop to get. And she gets those little like, you know, those tiny liquor bottles so she can get drunk at the funeral. Yeah. She's yelling like, fuck you to everybody. And everything's like horrified. Oh, wow. This is funny. I think it's. Once you're out of it, it's fun to watch from a distance. Not my funeral. I don't give a shit. Why ruin it? Is your dad embarrassed by her? Is he like one of those co-dependents who is like, oh, you know, she's just grieving, you know, or is he's. It's not. It was his mom. Yeah, it wasn't. He was the one who was grieving. She was just drinking. So she's just being an asshole? I guess, yeah, a little bit. I don't know how he. I mean, they they're not, I mean, maybe they're happy. We fucking knows you've been together forever now. Right. At a certain point, it's like, what are you going to do? Right. When you're like, you know, 60, whatever. Yeah. What are you going to start a new life? Yeah, it's hard when you're older. I feel bad for older women. I think older guys have a shot. We can always go out and find somebody. Right. If you're like in your fucking late 50s or like 60s with two kids. You don't have a shot if you're like 63 years old and you just like trains. Yeah. Yeah, that does not have any money. You're just a guy who likes trains. Yeah. Yeah, you're not she knocking a lot of pussy off the auction block when you fucking come with that. Yeah. The only woman he can fuck are the women that are tied up on the tracks rescue men. So usually we take a break right around now. You break on your podcast. Yeah. Why do you break? Just because it like offers people like a split. If you do like a 30 minute chunk, people listen to 30 minutes. If they're like, I don't know, I bred it. Where are we at? Time was about 30 minutes. OK, we'll take a quick break. Yeah. Sounds good. Take a quick break. Do you do any ads? No, we do like a Patreon where people can just like donate. It's like a monthly donation. Do they donate? Yeah. Now we're getting like 90 bucks. That's nice. Yeah. My friends started a podcast like two months ago. And that's where I got the idea for the Patreon thing. And I checked yesterday to see how much money they're making off donations to their podcast. And do you want to guess? Is it a good podcast? Yeah, it's a good podcast. $1,000 a month? No. It's just shy of like $8,000 a month. Wow. For like a podcast. Off like donations. It's good. That's insane. I mean, well. If we were smart, because they provide services. Yeah, they do like they know about fucking serious. Journalism and shit like that. Yeah. We're not like, we don't really know stuff. Yeah. We barely can keep a conversation going. Right, perfect. So we'll take a break. Sure. And then either, so here's the thing, either we'll decide like if we're having a good time, we'll like continue or like we'll just get Adam for the second half. Oh, a teaser. So take a break and we'll be back. They say you can't say that. So you want to film right now? Well, Shasta McMasty is saying it. So you want to brokish? Share me, sister. People say don't do that. Give them breast implants. We say do the McMasty. Shasta McMasty, the WWF speech show at Sidney Margolis Castar on the series premiere. You want to play in her sandbox? You're going to trade in that little digger for a steam shuffle, baby. A full hour beginning at 8, 7 central, UPN Tuesday. Bitch. OK, we're back. And Jim Norton is gone. Stav's fault, mainly. He loved me. Yeah, no, we recorded a second half with Jim. And then the recorder shut off because I didn't change the batteries. And I think there was like a rape override. We talked about rape for too long. We talked about a bunch of shit for too long. It was bad. Yeah, it was fucking terrible. It's probably better that it got erased, but it shut off. And then I didn't know what to do, so I panicked and just pretended like it was still on for a while. That's right, because at the end, you were like, oh, no. It doesn't work. Yeah. But hopefully Jim won't listen to this. He won't find out. No chance he listens. Yeah, of course not. I don't think he even knows the name of the podcast. Didn't ask. Didn't at all. Yeah. But yeah, no, we really fucked that one up. That was like a big. I know we should have done some work for us. It was a big guess, and we kind of ruined it by. We had nothing prepared. We had nothing prepared. We just won't. Like less prepared than when we do it with you, Adam. You know what I mean? But we're friends. We can't be like, hey, Jim, do you know about Dr. Evil? So all right, we're going to pretend that I'm Dr. Evil. And you need to react to it as if I actually were. I mean, what was just like, you didn't have anything to talk about with him, or? No, I mean, there's plenty of shit to talk about. It's just like, we want to just say dumb shit. Yeah. And I don't know if he was on board with that. No, not at all. He was just like answering earnestly. It was, yeah, it was like he was having like a really night. We talked about like, actually, that's probably going to stay in the first one, huh? Yeah, the first. The people I've already listened to. We talked about like dieting. Yeah, it was most. It was 27 minutes of talking about chicken salad and the best what you have to do to order chicken salad at Joe's. I told a great anecdote about going to Joe's on Third Avenue and I asked for a chicken salad. And the guy was like, hey, what do you mean? I'm telling literally the same story. People just listened to this, by the way. So Adam wasn't here. I mean, now you're telling me the story. Oh, that's right. I'm sorry. So a little new bit. Yeah, we have Felix Biederman from Chapman Trap House, honorary Puerto Rican rattlesnake, Felix Biederman, and Adam, of course, I'm back. Adam, the Puerto Rican rattlesnake. And I'm actually now, I'm Chirad Vros Halkius. Yeah, Chirad's Black, Chirad Vros Halkius. The Black or Rican rattlesnake. The Black or Rican rattlesnake from Race Wars. Spinoff, the spinoff. Stov told me he had a racial awakening on his way here. That's absolutely right. Yep, I'm a Black or Rican now. Yeah, we're actually now live at the Anthony Cumea Studios too in Bed-Stine. Bed-Stine. Believe it or not, Anthony's not actually allowed in this neighborhood. So we have to Skype him in whenever he tells us how to decorate the studio, because he wants it to look just like the top of the Empire State Building, where his real studio is. Oh, man. He likes to just stand on the balcony and just say the n-word. Yeah. So this whole place is filled with lawn jockeys, with a lot of blackface art, the way Anthony wants it. The Al Jolson wing of the studio. All of his concealed carry permits at the door and the walls, African masks with darts in them. I think the thing that sums up this studio is the graphic that reads right when you walk in, have you ever tried counting to $6 million? And it really makes you think. You're like, no, I haven't actually. It's too big of a number. How could a number be that big? I agree. I agree. He said that Mr. Show sketch with the highest number, but with the Holocaust. The next guy to add one number to another number is going to hear from my 45. That's such a good sketch. But boss. Oh, man. The pitch for that sketch must have made absolutely no sense. I mean, most of those sketches were like that. That's what made it such a funny show, is that they were just trying to be funny. Also, the fact that they kind of circumnavigated the fact that it's really hard to end a sketch, by just blowing it up and then like, you know, mash it or whatever. I'm trying to get into the next sketch. Maybe you guys can help me with this. Stov's company pays $50 for anyone who can come up with a sketch. Doesn't matter if you're homeless. It's true. It doesn't matter if you're illiterate. Yeah, I did get that $50 for an anonymous sketch. That's right. It's dropping this week, baby. Well, I want to do, here's what I need to. We need to riff this one out. Maybe maybe we can just do it on the podcast and then sell the idea. Yeah, so it's Jurassic Park. But Attenborough is like, we can bring back the dinosaurs and then we can fuck them once. He just wants to fuck the dinosaurs. So can you do the song? That's pretty much all we got. Well, no, OK, so the mosquito, it's sealed and come. And he says, this proves that even the tiniest of creatures can be fucked. I love it. Something about maybe getting pissed on by a hot, thick stream of brontosaurus piss. Yeah, being pissed on by Brian. Have you imagined eating the asshole of a brontosaurus as it unloads tons and tons of waste of foliage into your mouth? And he just wants to fuck the dinosaurs. Maybe Chris Pratt knows how to jack off velociraptors. That's why he does it really cool, though. He knows, yeah, he's a cool. He's got a cool. I'm not fat anymore. Style of jacking off. Yeah, I don't appreciate that. That guy betrayed us. Can you imagine how good he is at giving head? Because fat people are good at giving head. Hell yeah, dude. I eat because they like to eat. That's my favorite. I know. Yeah. You know what they say about fat girls, dude? Is there better given head because they like eating? You know those guys? Yeah. Hell yeah, dude. Yeah, because that's how you suck at food. You get nourishment like that. That's the way you eat things is by sucking it off. Classic. So speaking of getting sucked off or jerked off, somebody has a little story. Oh yeah, tell the story. Somebody got their little. Should I? Yeah, absolutely. I already told everybody. You said it during the first half? No, but I've been telling people. We should have. Yeah. I got a full service massage. What happened, dude? That's when you get jerked off in Jersey. It's a full service massage. Yeah, they actually don't let you jack off by yourself in Jersey. Yeah, it's a big problem they have. The public gas and they're just too strong. I was I had a slight headache. I was walking down Canal Street at about five in the afternoon a couple of weeks ago. And I saw and I had my back hurt because I had my laptop in my backpack and I saw a massage $25. Night 25, 25 bucks, 30 minutes. Where was the deal? Tell me off air on Canal Canal. What is like 35 in places on 100? Yeah, every single one of those places where they have like a discount massage, they'll jack you off. The best part of it is like she's like, you want harder soft. And I was like hard. And so she just starts walking on my back and it hurt. It's like very uncomfortable. It was a terrible massage. She actually fucked up my back for like four days. It's hilarious. But she jerked you off. She like you think you're going to get beat off or no. I didn't. It really wasn't in the front of my mind. You had an inkling though. I was if it happens, it happens. Listen to this motherfucker. Oh, I don't know if this $25 massage place will beat me off in the basement of a fucking shoe store. Yeah. This is like that Jim Carrey movie where he can't say no. Yeah. I was working shit out of it. Firelight. No, there was another one that was just like yes. Yes, man. How did he make that movie? Well, I mean, I consider Liar Liar the Quran and yes, man, like the Hadeeth. Yeah. He expanded on the lessons of that movie. Exactly. The best part was she's like, OK, hand or mouth with condom. And I was like, I don't. My sister listens. OK, whatever. It's too late. It's too late. All right. When I was 19, I was in Israel in a street club. You're worried about your sister hearing about sex on the KOM podcast. Yeah, that's right. I was in Israel at a strip club. There's this Russian woman with braces and fake tits. She had a necklace on that said sex on it. Oh, where do you get that necklace? It's just a fuck. And I was there with like a game with the braces. I was on my occupation tour with my friends. And you were there to steal the right land of just like and lap dances were 20 shekels, which is like $5. And we're getting like a ton of. I love that you're complaining about the price of. No, no, no. He's talking about what a bargain it is, dude. Oh, all right. He's doing it up even further. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was no way. There's no way. 20 shekels. Yeah. There's no way a Jew can complain about or mention the cost of something without a sound like a complaint. That's where that's where all that like Sheldon Adelson money goes goes to subsidized strippers. That's the birthright paper. $15 of the lap dance. That's pretty smart. Oh, I know I was anyway. Yeah, she's like you want private room. So I went and she was like blowjob with condom 200 shekel. And I was just like, which is like you talk to down. And I had I had my meal stipend thing for the month. Like the program gave us a meal stipend. Yeah. And I had literally had an envelope of cash in it. And I like fumbled through it. I just like entered the cash. And I got a blowjob with a condom came in three minutes. That's maybe maybe. Go ahead. OK. And well, the braces, the braces tear it off immediately. Yeah, that's smart. She knows what she's doing. That's less time than it takes for the iron dome to block a missile. Same technology. That's what that's actually they call that braces blowjob process. That's her nickname. There he is. There's the mold. God, this is so extremely online. It's so good. I love getting ironed down. Yeah, it was ironed down. I love getting ironed down from a tartar girl. Yeah, she mouth retarded. Her mouth retarded as hell, dog. Left my entire meal stipend for the month. In this girl's mouth? In that strip club. That's hilarious. I starved. Literally for a month, I would eat at five o'clock once a day. Yeah. I'd wait to eat. Ironic. That's like Ramadan. I'd eat at five. It's like my Jewish Ramadan. Anyway, I felt horrible about the whole thing. Yeah. Fast forward. Fast forward two weeks ago. She turns me over. She's like $50. So you're fully nude? No, not yet. I'm in my box. That's the funniest part of the whole story. Which person looked like, by the way? What's that? How are we looking? And what does she look like? You know, I don't want to do the accent, but the Chinese woman. She's like, but is she hot is what I'm getting at here. She was attracted. I know that people can't see this because this is a podcast, but Adam just put on a straw hat. And he's really stretching his eyes. He's got tape all over the place. All right, gong sound. Doodle doodle doodle doodle doodle doodle doodle doodle ding ding ding ding ding. We're in the massage parlor. So she says, do you want to touch me? And I was like, OK. So she takes my hand, puts it up her shirt, and I'm just like squeezing her boob. I'm like, OK, that's cool. OK, that's not bad. And she was hot. And she's like, yeah. She's like, OK, hand her mouth. And I was like, I'm not going to go for mouth with condom. I think I'm going to go hand. There's an expert practitioner. I see what you're saying. You're thinking she's much better at. I've never gotten a good hand job in my life. I would agree. Neither, yeah. Not even from me. I abuse my shit. You don't have a good technique, Adam? She did 50 million times better than I've ever done. So she's a pro. Incredible. But the best part was, I was wearing my box. She pulled out my box and said she looks at my dick. And then she looks up at me. And she goes, oh. Like it was the big thing. It was the biggest dick she'd ever seen in my entire life. And I was like, oh, come on. Yeah, yeah. I hate that. She's like, it's so big. A girl I hooked up with is not. A girl like that was doing the same shit. She was like, oh my god, it's so big. She's like pretending to choke on my. And I was like, listen, I've had my dick for a very long time. I know exactly how big my dick is. It is not a big fucking dick. She was doing fake gagging, dude. It was so embarrassing. I was embarrassed for both of us. She was actually just gagging. From, hey, what the fuck? Anyway, I left. I can't shoot her quick also. She beat you off. She beat me off. It was amazing. How much does the whole shebang run you? It was $75. I left and I was just so mad at myself. I was like, New York City, you've done it again. You just fucking vacuum $75 out of my pocket. Whatever, man. Like that could have been a decent pair of pants could have lasted me a couple years. That's true. And I just fucking paid for his sex work. Nothing, there's anything wrong with that. That's legit. And then I told the girl that I was used to be dating. I'm not dating her anymore. She was so mad at me. You told the girl you used to be dating and you got beat off. Yeah, we had an open thing. Then you paid to get jacked off by someone that looks exactly like her. So she was like, what her life would be like if her parents didn't come over. But I thought it was this progressive thing where she's like, yeah, I want to fuck other people too. Yeah, that's totally a Bernie Sanders move, dude. Yeah, you're so right. She does cam work. Or she did cam work. So I didn't think that it was like a big deal to her. And she's like, you're disgusting. That's disgusting. Interesting. I don't feel bad. Is cam work bad, though? I feel like you have to because we live in the future now. You have to beat off. That's like the new way to fuck. I would love, if my dick was bigger, I would beat off with a luchador mask on. You don't have to have a big dick, dude. You already have all those Instagram followers. That's true. A lot of his men want to fuck me. Yeah, you can just. There was a guy I saw on Chatterbait one time who had to be, like, 89 years old. He looked like. What a start of a sentence. There was a guy I saw on Chatterbait one time. He's this old ass man. Dude, how does Chatterbait work? It's just people just jack off on cam with people jacking. No, no, no. That's chat roulette. Chatterbait is like it's in the gallery. That's also LinkedIn premium. Yeah. Yeah, it's like it's like a gallery. You can choose somebody to watch Master Bay or whatever. You watched an 89 year old man beat off. I was like, look how old this man is. I mean, there is there's a market for everything. Oh, yeah. Like that's what half of bodybuilders support themselves by like jacking off on their stuff. That's how they buy animal is that they gave her pay stuff. Yeah, there's actually a separate room in GNC where you can do all the supplements. Yeah. But when Arnold to raise money to come to America, Arnold's dad actually just recorded himself jacking off on an eight millimeter distributed like over the iron curtain. Oh my god. He's a copy idiot. Well, that guy. Yeah, that guy. He was like, you know, like 89 years old, you know, big long white beard. He looked like the giver. You know the cover of the giver. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. That guy like Walt Whitman. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He looked like Walt Whitman. Well, kids, right? Yeah, less of less of a sexual deviant than the actual Walt Whitman. This is just a guy that's on little boy's faces. And so he's got and he's got like this distended belly and like, you know, just like an old fucking ass man. He's got nipple clamps and he's like beating and hitting his dick with shit and he's jacking off. And he just seemed to be having like a great time. And I'm like, you know what? Good for him. Figured out the computer. He's like, you know, living an active life. This isn't like, it's not deviant if he's like, you know, like his family is probably like, yeah, Grandpa loves the computer. We got him. They're like, yeah, he's using the camera to keep in touch with friends from the war. He's Skyping all over. Yeah, yeah, he loves Skype. He's just on Skype all the time. He doesn't really use any of the email software we got him. But it's yeah, he loves that camera. So, you know, he's holding out. Oh my God. Have you guys ever tried to have Skype sex before? I have. It's terrible. I have so bad. You just feel silly. Like you like see yourself in the little box. You see the little corner like, you know, like I didn't. Just your mangled face just like beating off. Oh, no, I get a top angle of my dick and I angle it down so that my dick looks good. No, I'd go. You're like the tears now looking like a jacking off. Just a trees and leaves. I got a lens flare coming up. It was just a chastened voiceover. I don't know what I gave you. Yeah, I only do it in 70 millimeter. 70 millimeter. The light is just exquisite. I mean, Louis CK is really adamant about using a red box for his jackoff footage. When he does it in front of women without their consent, they're bringing that back. That's coming back. It's kind of bad. Roseanne was talking about it. Who was it, Jen Kirkman that said that? Yeah, apparently she said it and then deleted it. She said that he either said that he did it to her or brought up the allegations and then deleted the tweet. Interesting. That he's just like a subway jackoffer, but he does it in the hotel? Yeah, he does it in his hotel room. He dresses his hotel room up like a subway station and then invites people. You know, you got to swipe. You got to swipe to get in. Yeah, he's an autistic pervert because he has to incorporate trans. Yeah. Oh, god. I don't know, I mean, it seems like from what I've heard, there's been no substantial claim. It might be a thing he likes to do consensually, is beat off in front of people. But if that's a thing, then that's just kink shaming. Yeah, whatever. He's the president of comedy. Well, I don't know. I mean, if he's doing that, here's my stance. If he's doing that against people's will, I'm against it. So sorry, guys. Well, even then, I mean, he is a very good comedian. Sorry, guys. Dude, you're really taking forms of sexual assault. Sorry. You're coming out firing shots. That's the kind of guy I am. Wow. Well, hold on. I didn't say, you know, I said if, you know. Who are the other? Remember, there was that one comedian, champion. That guy champion. Was it Vince Champion? The clean guy who was also like a rapist and murderer. No, now I'm just accusing Vince Champion of being the rapist. There was a guy that was like on the road. The champion brothers from DC, those guys? Yeah, the champion brothers. There's like four or five. When I watch porn, do you remember that bit? They had this very anti-gay bit. What was it? Do you remember? Dude, this guy had a bit of a pro porn bit, which was incredible. I don't remember. It made no sense. He's like, when I watch porn, I ain't trying to hurt nobody. Yeah, they were great. There was a guy doing anti-gay bits of Caroline the other night. Remember that? That guy that was like, just don't do it around me. Who, Mattel? No. Yeah, it was Mattel. Well, in my defense, it was open mic night. There was a guy, I remember, did I talk about Big Ron on the podcast before? No. I don't know if it was. Yeah, I think that was his name. Big Ron, Big Ron. Were you saying something like, do we cut you off, I don't remember? Who, me? Yeah. I don't know, probably. Whatever. You do that shit all the fucking time, dude. We're going to beef about it. I do? No. I mean him. Adam does it. Yo, let's blaze up. Adam's the cutoff for it. Yeah. No, there was this guy that used to go to a Japanese. You do the Mic at Japanese? No, what a shit. That's, yeah, that sushi restaurant, where the light was just Ian Salmon, like drunkenly holding up a candle at you. Oh, Ian Salmon, yeah. Who would do 35 minutes in between every comic. But yeah, now this guy, Big Ron, he came in, and he's like, immediately like, I don't write down shit. I never write down shit. It's all, you know, improvosional, you know? I'm like saying things off the top of my mind. And so he goes up, and it's like a nice restaurant. And then he's talking about, like, you know, in jail, you know, you think that hearing people being raped would be bad, but it's not that. It's when you hear motherfucker getting stabbed. That's the fucked up part. There used to be this big motherfucker, and he used to jack off to the little Michael videos. Michael Jackson be coming on the TV, pull his dick right out, and jack off to Michael. And, you know, people are just trying to, like, eat dinner, and then my favorite thing about that guy is he handed me his business card. I was, like, talking to him afterwards, and he had, like, a business where it was a detailing service, but just for Lincoln Town cause. Yo, I do not do fucking escalation. The only thing I touch, Lincoln Town cause. Dude, that's, oh man, that reminds me of when Rala did Funny Moms. Yeah. Rala is our friend. Rala is one of the funniest comics. And every Rala boy can check him out. He's definitely a comics comic. We all, like. No, he's a good comic. No, I mean, like, back in the room always loves Rala, you know. Yeah, in fucking shitty alt rooms is what you're talking about. Right. So he did, he did our shitty alt show in DC, and, you know, it's all white people with clenched assholes, and he's just, like, talking about pink Ariel isn't crushing everyone. Then again. Saying the N-word, and like, everyone's just, like, oh, we love this, we love this. And he's just, like, he's killing. He's killing. And then, like, all of a sudden, just midway through his set, he's like, nah, but seriously, no, gay sex is disgusting. How are you going to have sex in a bathroom? Here he goes, he goes, how the fuck you going to get raped to death in a bathroom? Donna AIDS and shit. And then you could just hear a pin drop. Just literally every single, like, Columbia Heights soft ass, like, white DC, you know, like, works at the, you know, fucking some NGO and, like, just silence. And then the back of the room, like, all the comments are just dying. Yeah, he's, he's really funny. Gay sex is gross. But, like, seriously, no, gay sex is disgusting. Just like, wow. How are you going to go there and talk? Just read the room. I used to do his rooms and just get absolute, well, you gave me the best advice. Like, whenever I'd work a black room in DC, I just, like, they say, come up next to the stage, I'm freelance, and then just, like, there always be a drunk woman in the stage. I'd just be like, oh, he look like Harry Potter, right? And then, like, everyone started laughing and stuff. And I just, I didn't know what to do. And I'd feel like really, like, intimidated and stuff. And the stop was just like, yo, if anyone makes fun of you, just tell them that they have a tight shirt. Yeah, 100% crushes every time. Crushes every time. Look how tight this guy's shirt is. Look at the little ass shirt. Call someone gay and say they have a little ass shirt. I would always make fun of Rollo for being dark-skinned. Everyone love that shit. Oh, man. Rollo hates the Warriors because they're too light-skinned. That's so funny. Yeah, he's anti-light-skinned people. I love it. He's such a stand to take. I love it. Well, he is pretty dark. He's as dark as the fuck. Yeah, dude. He's dark as hell. It's a stage name. Rollo? Rollo Boykins. What are we telling people this for? Yeah. That's what he used to order pizzas under when he was at Howard. That's the Genesis. Why do you need a name to order pizzas? He used to tell the pizza guy Rollo Boykins. Interesting. My friend went to GW and he had this fat piece of shit roommate. This, like, Asian Pacific. What are they called? Pacific Islander. APA, whatever the name they have. Asian Pacific Islander. Yeah, Asian Pacific Islander or whatever. He was Samoan. Yeah, he was like one of the Rocks' Costumes. Island Chinese. That's what he was doing. He was spam Chinese. Yeah, he was shrimp Chinese. So he goes, he was this big fat kid, but he was Catholic. And I remember one time I crashed in their dorm or whatever and he was out of town and he had a crush on, was it Rachel Adams is the actress? Rachel McAdams. Rachel McAdams. And so above his bed, he had a poster of the notebook on the ceiling, which is like, that's not the movie you beat off. You don't have a crush on that actress. I'm like, dude, the woman she's in love. In that case, so he's real fat. And I remember my friend was telling me, so for Lent, he gave up pizza. And the first day of Lent, they're ordering from Manny and Olga's or whatever. And they're like, Jesse, do you want anything? And he was like, yeah, let me get a cow's own. And he's like, no, it's not a pizza. Holy fuck. I love people who follow really strict religions. And then they're just like, oh, yeah, I'm going to fool God. Like the Haasids. Like, I'm from Chicago and there's like just we gave Haasids an entire neighborhood, Rogers Park. And half the people in Rogers Park are Shabbos boys. And oh, yeah. Yeah, and I always thought that was weird. Like, oh, like A, they didn't update the rules to be like, oh, yeah, pressing an elevator button is work. We've decided that for some reason. But we're going to get around that by like hiring a Mexican kid on Birchwood in California to press the button for it. It's like, why didn't they do it then? That's what they do? That's how they do it. They do that shit here. That's incredible. On Pride last year, did I mention this? I said this. Was there a Chabad float at Pride? I don't think you said it on the podcast. I don't know if I said it on the podcast, but last year at Pride, I was walking home when I walked through Pride. And there's a protest. There's a counter pride protest. And at first it looks like they're Hussheeds. And I get closer. And they're Mexican guys wearing the outfits. And they're holding signs. And they're these like, you know, tired, you know, that like five foot one Guatemalan type where you can tell underneath the hat, he's got like a faux hawk. Like those guys, I was like, what the fuck is this? This looks like Hussheeds are just hired day laborers to protest at Pride. And it didn't like make sense. It was just too absurd to make sense. And then the next day I saw in like the New York Daily News or something that, yeah, Hussheeds hired day laborers to go protest Pride. I guess it was, you know, because it was Shabbos or something. Or they couldn't be there. Or they just didn't want to go themselves. So they hired day laborers to dress up like them and protest. I did the opposite of that when I was a kid. You had sex with day laborers to dress up like Hussheeds. No, there was like a Puerto Rican Day Parade Pride, or Puerto Rican Day Parade in Chicago or like some type of Latino parade. And like my mom knew the person was organizing it. But for whatever reason, they couldn't locate Latino children to do it. And I was eight. And I was like, I was way darker as a kid. I'm glad things worked out for you. Yeah, and I was scared for a moment. You parade every day. Thank God. But I bleached like one of the reggae singers. Give me the asshole kind. I need the extra strong asshole kind. But my best friend was Greek. And we were like really dark. And they paid us $20 each to lead the parade that makes your drive. Like Carly's Latino children. They're too fiery. They'll just run off. A soccer game might break out if we let them lead it. Yeah, there's some real race science there. Like the Jewish and Greek brain has the European order gene that can carry the sign without straying. Oh my god. Did you see where I guess we said we weren't going to talk about him anymore, but Cockfield. No, Nick, please stop. Fuck Adam, go ahead. You were using his real name. Well, we killed off the other guy. I don't want to do a cruel impression anymore. But I do want to make fun of he got. He got you got. He's like my girlfriend got 23 and me. You just said you don't want to do. I don't want to do a cool impression. I'm doing an accurate impression. My girlfriend got me 23 and me results for my birthday. Oh, I didn't see that. Yeah, yeah. And so he's like 96% like British and Irish or whatever. And then he's like 4% African. So he's like, here's the results, everybody. I'm 1% African, 4%, 1% Pacific Islander, 4% African, 95% who cares. And also, those, by the way, are like, that's within the margin of error, that 4%. Like, I was like 6% Jewish or something. And it's like, it's not Jewish. Stov immediately got on the phone and said, what's going on with this? The margin of error, it's the margin of error. I want my money back. Did you see that? There's a thing on PBS where Henry Lewis Gates was doing like ancestry tests for famous black people. I saw that. And Oprah was like sitting there. She's like, I talked to my spirits. And I know I am a Zulu. I am a Zulu warrior. I have Zulu warrior blood. And they were like, no, you're Ghanaian, like every other black person in America. Yeah, South Africa was not part of the triangle, like slavery. It's like, what the fuck are you talking about, Oprah? It's so funny. Do you follow? Quincy Jones was more white than black, I think, too. Was he? I immediately burned every album he produced after that. It was like, no way, buddy. What were you going to say, Nick? I found them through Haywood, but one of those pan-African Facebookers. Oh, yeah, I remember those. Yeah, there was one. Because 90% of the things they share, it's like, be proud of your culture. Be proud of your heritage. And it's like a positive, affirming stuff. And then 5% of them, there's nothing wrong with female genital mutilation. Yeah. They shared one meme that was like, Europeans didn't bathe before they discovered Africans or something. It was like, they learned bathing from you. I was like, going into water, that didn't come up. At some point. Oh, my god. Yeah, no, there's like a bunch of sites like that that claim basically every single invention was actually made in Africa, like 3,000 years ago. Who are those like black Israelites? Black Israelites outside the gallery, place Metro Station. Yeah, they're great. So they think that white people were created by an evil scientist named Yakob that invented white people in his lab by accident. Well, that differed, like the nation of Islam. Nation of Islam falls to the same shit where the evil scientist Yakob used germs from black people to create white people. But in the black Israelite version, he does it by accident. It's like the nutty professor. Yeah. Oh, look what he loved. Which is funny, because they all look like the clumps. All of those guys. At least there was. So wait, this is true? Like there's a scientist? It's like a. That's what they believe. Yeah, they really believe that. Yeah, scientists and the nation of Islam. Nation of Islam believes some like really cool shit. Like they. What's Farrakhan? Is he like still active? Like he's still doing his thing. I saw a video with him and Young Thug, and it was like really powerful. Really? Yeah. Young Thug was like, it's so amazing to meet you. Farrakhan would really like you. Yeah, he'd love me. Yeah. What's with the bow ties? What's the deal with the bow ties? They look pretty, pretty cool. Yeah, but there's got to be a reason to. I actually don't know. I know like most of the nation of Islam stuff, because it's big in Chicago, like they eat navy bean pies because that's supposed to make you live to 150. Oh, yeah. But the bow ties is probably something so like probably like while like while you'd Muhammad or someone was like, I think they look good. Right. And then like usually there's a reason for shit. Like you notice that no Iranians wear neckties and they because they think ties are a symbol of Western imperialism. Oh, really? Yeah, but. I thought it was they just like showing off chest hair. Yeah, yeah, the same reason. And gold chance. I mean the Iranians. Yeah, yeah. But no, I actually I think the bow tie like the founder wore them or something. Everything else has like a cool reason behind it. Like the 9000 years ago, some guy invented white people or a spaceship showed up with the bow ties. They're like, oh, we just like him. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's like I was trying to get a good. I was reading. Do you know the the story with the Hasid's why they dress like that? Well, basically they went when the Jews like left the pale of like settlement like in Eastern Europe. That was like that was like Eastern Europe style. And then once they left, they basically stopped evolving their style. So they just kept dressing like so. Everyone dressed like that at some point. Well, in their particular yeshivas, right? So like that's one yeshiva had like the circle hats. One yeshiva had like, you know, pay is one, you know. Did I tell that story on the podcast about that guy at the Halloween party? I think he did that we were at. Wait, no. Remember that guy at that Halloween party we were at? But didn't you tell us on the podcast? I don't think you did. I don't know when I was there. Yeah, we were at that Halloween party with those giant M&M's who were listening to Fleetwood Mac. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. When we we met up with Tommy and then he was in the bathroom for like four and a half hours. Oh, yeah. Do you ever do you ever do you have a bloke guy? Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, holy shit. Oh, my God, dude, this is completely separate story. But I was we were trying to find Coke and I went up to our friend Tommy, my friend Tommy and he's sitting there. And I was like, hey, do you got a blow guy? And I said that to him. And it was like kind of loud where we're at. So he like reflects for a half second. He's like, nah, but I fucked a tranny once. And I was like, what? And he's like, did I ever blow a guy? Yeah, he's like, you asked me if I ever blew a guy. I was like, no, I said, do you have a blow guy? But why is that your response? On the spectrum of gay stuff that is closer to being gay than being straight. I guess. Yeah, he's now he told a great story about like following this after a show in Philly. Yeah, yeah, he like bought a prostitute or whatever. And she was like blowing him. And then I thought he just met a woman at helium. No, no, I think he's like bought a prostitute. Or that's what the story is. And then he like he's like, it's his story to tell. So I don't want to tell it. He's got a career now. So yeah. But but yeah, no, that was a funny interaction. But no, the guy at the party at the Halloween party when he's talking about those big circular hats that his seeds wear, and he's like, those Ottomans. Yeah, yeah. There's like big Ottomans, the big IKEA Ottomans. And he's got he's like, yeah, dude, one of my friends actually he got one of those. And I was like, what do you mean? He was like, you know, he's riding his bike. And he managed to like get one. It was like, what do you mean, he stole it? I was like, yeah. And he was like, yeah, he got arrested for like, you know, Grand Larsen or something because he got they caught it because like you can't just be the guy wearing the one guy. And then a fucking odd future shirt. Do you know Shine, the rapper that got arrested with Diddy? Yeah, yeah. He's a Hasidic Jew now. And he's like wearing a stripe. It's called a strimal. Yeah, yeah, that's what they call it. He like decided $6,000. Yeah, dude, they're super expensive. It's like otter fur. That's crazy. Yeah. I don't even know where you get otters. It's like young boss. It's actually young boy. Well, it's not more of a bear, but yeah. Well, he's got like a cup fit because he's hairless. He's a cub. I'm a cub. Thank you very much. Actually, it's more walrus because a cub. Cub is like a cub is like a small but still hairy bear type. If you're large and hairless, it's walrus. I'm not a walrus. I'm a manatee. I'm a cub. Cubs are cuter. I don't know. I would go walrus. They have it. There's no way they need more animals. I don't have any tusks. This is like a body acceptance thing. Yeah, you're right. People aren't just bears or cubs. It's like the original body acceptance people. They'll fetishize anything. Yeah, absolutely. You may. There's that stereotype like, oh, all gay guys are in shape. And it's like, no, just the ones you secretly jack off to. Just the ones in your movie. My friend, there was this dude in college that was like, his whole persona was he was a total alpha. He was like a Long Island, Nassau County Jewish, like fucking blowout, like looked like a Jersey Shore Guido. And my friend, he was always strange because he had a Leonidas from hell yeah, 300 poster of just this jacked ass Gerard Butler, like six feet tall in his bedroom. We were like, why does why does Brian have that in his room? And then my my friend, for some reason, who was his roommate, like took his laptop to go on Pornhub and then like saw the last 10 searches. It was like, guy kisses guy for first time. Oh, it's totally straight guy. Fuck straight guy. I still look as fuck. I think that's what all like motivation shit is. Like whenever you go to YouTube and it's like motivation of Phil Heath. No, I just like people are jacking off to that. Yeah, for sure. 100% I mean, like I watch I obsessively watch MMA and have for years. And like it's the big thing is like watch the Wayans where they get naked and almost like get so close to each other, they kiss each other. You're like, oh, dude, I can't wait. Are you saying weigh in? And I thought you said Wayans like the Wayans brother. Yeah, when the Wayans brothers come down to the octaves. Keenan Ivory, Damon. How many are there? There's like some of those guys who definitely gave by the way of the way by law of averages. Yeah, of course. They're so of the Wayans brothers. Damon Wayans is so homophobic. How about this guy? How about this? The gay and Ivory. No, Norm. Norm was or Jezel Nick. Jezel Nick, by the way, Nick. Great games, man. Thank you. Sorry, I wanted to get that one in there before I missed it. Sorry, I was talking. I said, Gaines Brothers. That's good. They are going to be feeling that one in the morning. That's a switch. That's a switch. We're saying the norm. Jezel Nick was just saying that like Keenan Ivory Wayans, when he was a judge on Last Comic, was the absolute biggest piece of shit, of course, that he's like ever worked with. I could see that. He's like, I've never hated anyone in comedy more than. All right, let's just talk shit about someone's second hand. So if you have a problem, Keenan Ivory, you can come on the pod. Yeah, we'll squash it. Yeah, we're big squashers. What happened to Simon from American Idol? What's he doing now? He went on another one. Oh, he's on another one. He fucked someone's wife or something. He's still like his friend's wife or something. He's one of those like Simon? Yeah. That doesn't make sense. Because you know, you just assume most British guys are gay. Yeah, of course. And then they're like actually cool. You know, they're like a cool alpha type. Well, Statham, not gay. Well, of course, yeah. Of course not. I mean, that's why they brought him to America. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They were waiting for a non-gay British man. Yeah, they should make a Statham movie where he solves Brexit with karate. We've got to bring the country back together. I'm bald. Yeah, yeah, I'm bald. I don't have any hair, and I don't need it. I hate Chinese, and I'm gay. I'm gay. I'm racist. I hate Chinese, and I got nowhere. What was the genesis of that? The fact that we were just walking around Green Point. Oh, yeah, we're out of time. We're done. Yeah, we filled our contractual obligation to the people that donated $97. Is that what we're pulling in? Yeah. Yo, shout out to my friend Max, who's a listener, who's buying us the tracksuits. Yeah, Max, thank you for the tracksuits. We're getting come boys. We'll suck you off, Max. Yeah, yeah. I don't agree. Stah will suck you off. Adam will suck you off, Max. You guys, you just got the shout out, the podcast shout out. Yeah, this is big. And then thank you, Felix, for joining us. My pleasure. His presence alone on there. We got two big gets for this one, guys. That's good, yeah, yeah. A lot of people are going to listen to this, seeing the names, expecting a mash-up. Well, most people are not going to make it through the first half. Are we going to go in the first half, though? Are we going to do chop-up mash-up? We would love to have you guys on chop-up. I've been practicing my Slava Zizek impression. Will does a great impression of you. Of me? Yeah, yeah. What does it sound like? I mean, it sounds like you. I don't know. I can't do it. It sounds like really gay and like a little bitch. He's like, oh, madam, I'm a bitch. I mean, like, you shouldn't say that so much. Shabbat shalom. Shabbat shalom, boys. Shabbat shalom, good Chinese girls. Where are the shackle prostitutes? $25. I can't pass that. Oh, boy, that's too much. I'm only capable of doing Dickfield. Me and Stover joke, and like, so I don't want to do the sound effects or whatever, so I'm not actually going to do it. But like, there's like lightning or something, and a portal opens. No, I did save it. We got to do this. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're doing it. All right. Little teaser, guys. Yeah, you're going to really like it. That's a little behind the scenes. This is what happens when you go past the fucking 40-minute mark on the second half. Hell, yeah. We start breaking the fourth wall. It's been a fun one. But yeah, it was a good one, guys. Thanks for listening. I don't know. We don't have anything planned. Yeah, no, we should do that mash-up, though. For sure. Yeah, we would love. We would fucking love to do that. Which we want to do. We want to use Bobby Kelle might let us use his studio to do that, which is like, it's sort of like a second-rate Anthony Kumiya studio. It's above Matt. Matt, if you are listening by a fucking plan, do not talk shit on my KNDD studios. Matt doesn't live here. No, Matt lives in Cleveland, but he can just come out. He came up for the live show. Yeah, they can Skype him in, too. I mean, they got this Indian kid there that knows how all the computers work. Oh, and if you're in New York, we have a live show in the works for August. Oh, yeah, I want to do, if you guys are cool with it, I want to plug the Chapo live show on July 28th in Philadelphia at Everybody Hits. And yes, due to the name, it is a group sex event. We are running a train. We're running a cell on these thotties. Hell yeah, bro. Well, we got the venue that we're doing is Come On, Everybody, for Come Town. Oh, is that the name of the venue? It's Come On, Everybody, but for us, it's Come On. Oh, yeah, yeah, I love it. That's perfect. I love it, dude. Well, we saved that one. We saved it. Yeah, that was great. This was really fun. Yeah, thanks. I'm pretty funny. Thanks, everybody. Thanks for getting jerked off, Adam. Night. MUSIC Huh? MUSIC Well, what do you think? Do you want to go after the kids? Hooray!",

I need, it's basically like they're paying for my like social skills surgery and like a murder, like a, like terminal autism and they're donating to, you know, letting us pretend like we have a real radio show. We have a real radio show. We're in the top of the empire state building at the Anthony Coombs studios. No, yeah. Come on, man. The, the rattlesnake, then Puerto Rican rattlesnake, then in the snake pit, the, what's then in Spanish abuela is abuela. Every word in Spanish is abuela. Yes. Um, you know what's funny is like sometimes I'll try to be racist and I'll add O to the end of a word to like make it Spanish. Yeah. It turns out to just be the word. Like you got a restaurant. Oh, that's it. I don't think that's the name of the restaurant. That's a famous one. I feel like everyone goes to be bleoteca. Yeah. When I was in Spanish class in, uh, in middle school, uh, me and my friends thought we were really clever. So we made up a gang. We're like, we're Los, Los Mari posas, the butterflies. We thought that was hilarious. And like all, like all, like we kept making jokes like, Oh, Los Mari posas are going to get you. And then like my teacher couldn't take it like midway through the semester and she just like slammed a book down. She's like, that means the homosexual. What are you doing? You had no idea it was slang for a gay man. Yeah, we didn't know that. So your gang was there. I mean, it was pretty good. We didn't think it sounded too hard. Do you know the rule with like, uh, Mary Cohn and Cabron? This is like the two of them. It's peruvian guy told me like 10 years ago, but he's like, you know, like if you're friends with Mexican guys, you can call him Cabron. Like that's like a term of endearment or whatever. Among them he's like, but don't call other South America or like other Spanish speaking people Cabron. Cause like Cabron apparently just means like top faggot. I want to be a cabron. Right. And then Maricón is like the bottom one, but that's only, oh, you mean top, like top and bottom. He's like top and bottom. So it's like, you're like a pimp. If you say it to a Mexican, I don't know. I didn't check any of this. Peruvian guy told me Peruvian guy, who's name at a bus station. No, I worked with him. I mean, we took the bus together, but I worked with him. So maybe he did tell me it was on a bus. It was on a bus. There's a Peruvian as a fat Peruvian kid. I love it. And I swear to God, his name was Nick Nolte. He told me he wrote that down as his name on a thing. And I was like, no way. That's hilarious. He put that down. That's a good reference, dude. That was a solid reference. He's been a liar. I love it. And then he was like, what? And I was like, that's not your name. And he was like, yeah, it is. And he was also a pathological liar. And we were, I think we were talking about that the other day. It's like pathological liars. They have all these bullshit stories. And then one of their stories will be like real. You're like, you fucking actually beat up a chimp. That actually happened for real. He's got like pictures of him in the chimp. He's got blood all over his face. But yeah, no. So he pulls out his ID and there it says Nick Nolte. Spelled the same way. Spelled exactly the same way. That's awesome. Yeah. And I was like, that's insane. He's like, yeah, it's a family name. I'm like, well, every name is a family. I don't know what to find. Yeah, what does that mean when someone says it's a family? Well, it's a family name. It means they don't know how to read. It means they've never encountered another human being in the world. Unless their whole family is all just like, you know, Cher and Madonna. This is my aunt Madonna. Did you know that Marcus Doodoo Brown was a family name? I don't want to shit on Marcus. I don't want to do do on Marcus. There we go. Marcus is a good comic. I like Marcus. We're still drinking coffee guys. We got the rift juice. Starbucks. Let me get a grande rift juice. But yeah. So Maricón is the bottom one. Cabrón is the top one. Yeah, that's such an awesome term. Yeah, you fuck a man in the hour top. You're my boy, dude. They're cool. What else they got? I don't understand. What's the proper term? Is it you could Mexicans fine? You can say that. Right? It feels a little weird. It felt weird. Yeah, because it's like growing up. Most of the people I knew that were like Hispanic were like you had to call them Hispanic because they could be from Venezuela. Right. Right. Right. I'll solve it. Yeah. Yeah. And Salvador or whatever. Colombia. But then I moved to Texas and people in Texas are like, Oh, there's a bunch of Mexican guys that live there. Keep your voice down. I grew up in the Southwest. Yeah. And they're all Mexican. So you could call them that. Really? You didn't have any like fucking Uruguayans any any Spanish person. But what is the fucking Mexican over there? But it's like Puerto Rican people are like, I'm Mexican man. Well, I don't know what to do. Oh, I see. I see. Yeah. Yeah. It's just. What is Chicano? Is that if you're like for you're from Chicago? Is that like Chai Rack? If you're in Chai Rack, but you're Mexican? Chicano, I feel like it means you're wearing like a velvet shirt. Yeah. It's a clothing thing. Like a Vato. I feel like no silk. Vato just means dude. Chicano is like they like I identify as Chicano. Oh really? Yeah. Chicano is Chicano is on par with Hispanic or Mexican or Latino stupid. I am. I think Chicano. I just think the guy the the Jesus, the Jesus character from fucking help me out here. The bowling I can't believe. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Lebowski. Lebowski. When you say Chicano. You know the bowling movie. Yeah. The famous bowling movie. Big Lebowski. Oh, yeah. When you say any words. When you say Chicano, that's what I think for some reason. And I bet I can't wait to Google it later and find out how wrong I am. I think I think Michael Chikliss. I think Chicano is like the Mexican term for Michael Chikliss. I think about that movie Bloody and Blood Out. So if you look like Michael, if you're Hispanic, but you look like Michael Chikliss, you're Chicano. You're like bald, like you're like a bald, portly Latino guy. That's what Chicano is. How short do you think? He seems very short. Four foot eleven. Imagine if he was four eleven. And then when he goes on talk shows, he goes, or as I like to call it, five foot negative one. Like Winx. That's good. Yeah. That's everyone applauded. Chicliss. Great talk show guest. We'll have him on. We'll have him on. Yeah, we got Chicliss. Is Chicliss short? We're gonna make fun of him. He's at the same height as us. No, I think he's short. He looks like a testicle. He does. Somebody described Bob Hoskins that way one time. But he looks like a testicle. Yeah, an angry testicle. That's pretty good. You know what's funny? He like died loathing the Super Mario Brothers movie. Poor guy. That movie was so bad. It was really bad. Everything about it was awful. That might have been the most underwhelming celebrity death of all time, Bob Hoskins. What happened? He was a lot of really good movies. He was an amazing actor. Yeah, he was. He was really talented and he died and nobody gave a shit. When did he die? He died like two years ago and on the anniversary of his death last year, articles about his death started coming up and people were like, oh my god, Bob Hoskins died. Well, that's what happened, dude. I feel like literally in like a year, this past year, everyone claims they loved every celebrity. Like it used to be there to be like a status here or there, but everyone's writing an essay now. I don't fucking like, were people that important to you? It doesn't feel like it just came to the thing. I mean, some of them were like, you know, Muhammad Ali is big. Sure. Prince is big. Bowie. Prince. The fucking bad guy from Harry Potter. That one was stupid. Snape? Yeah. Well, he was in the die hard. I don't know. He ended up being the good guy. You fucking illiterate piece of shit. Maybe illiterate to see a movie. Yeah, he's starred in a book. Dude, there's a new Harry Potter coming out. So it looks like your boy is about to read a book. Is there a new one coming out? I think yeah, she's making mad Harry Potter. Hell yeah, dude. That bitch ain't rich enough. JK, get yours, girl. You never read any Harry Potter bitch, dude. Me? Little Mullen. What were you doing, dude? No, I think I read... At 11, what were you doing? Harrowing. I read books. Well, I didn't really read that many books. I guess the books I read as a kid were like, I guess Goosebumps was like elementary school. Hell yeah. What was it, Fear Street? I read maybe one of those. Those were like the more hardcore ones, right? Yeah, and then I would read the shit we were assigned in school. The only shit I really remember reading outside of school was CS Lewis stuff, Ender's Game. I read all those Ender's Game books, but he came out with like nine other books after a resurgence in the popularity of those books when I was in middle school. Yeah, because I remember Ender's Game, that came out in the 80s. I remember reading that when I was in third grade, and then again when I was in fifth grade, and then they released a whole... You know what it was? It was an additional series based on one of the characters from Ender's Game. A little spin-off Frasier, the Frasier of the Ender's Game. Yeah, actually it was Frasier. It was a novelization of Frasier. Niles. Niles, there's aliens. We have to fuck these aliens. My favorite books growing up were that book at Fudge, do you remember? Hell yeah. I fucked with Fudge. Judy Blum. Mine, Count. Yeah, yeah. They had to be Fudge or Mine, Count. Well, they're both like coming-of-age stories. Yeah, yeah, it's a period. That's a big chapter. They're both written in prison. You know what I never understood? Judy Blum was in prison. Judy Blum doing time for a fucking manslaughter. Not to get into conspiracy theories here, but like, how was it that Anne Frank was the only person with a diary? That was the only one- That shit just popped off the hardest. There couldn't be, there was not a better- She got her period in it. Yeah. I've never read it. Speaking of Judy Blum and getting your period, I was like really into those Fudge books, and then I got, are you there, God? It's me, Margaret. One summer, like my parents made me do the fucking summer reading club or whatever. Of course. And I read it, and it's about getting your period for the first time. So like, I had a bunch of questions from my parents, and my mom literally took me to the library and yelled at the librarian in front of me. It was so humiliating. It was so humiliating. Don't you ever tell my boy about girls. How dare you. This is a young adult novel. This should not be easy readers. My mom, like, struggled to quit smoking for years, and she finally did, and then she was like all about anti-smoking, and she chewed out the ice- She was screaming at the Nigerian ice cream truck man for like bringing candy cigarettes to the neighbor. She's like, how fucking dare you sell these you piece of shit. And like, I'm like mortified. Of course, yeah. I didn't even want those. I wanted the fucking Ninja Turtle with bumblegum eyes. The best one. Yeah, yeah. I didn't want the candy cigarettes. It tasted like shit. They were awful candy cigarettes. They were cool. You could do smoke. You could pretend to smoke. They were so cool. I remember when I was, we lived in LA, and like after baseball games, we'd get like, you know, pieces of apple slices and like granola and stuff. Then we moved to Vegas, and like we get like fucking cheeseburgers. People like bring McDonald's, and like the kids would go fucking nuts for McDonald's. Hell yeah, dude. Mickey D's after a soccer game. That was my shit, dawg. I was good at that. No, it was funny. I remember that. You played baseball, and then my dad would like take me to 7-Eleven, and I'd get like the largest slurpy size. After like baseball practice, baseball is the lowest impact sport I know. I know you're barely fucking running for it. You just stand there. Yeah. Horrible. Even fucking Gatorade is just sugar. Yeah. Well, you needed it. Gatorade. It's got the electrolytes, dude. It's got the electrolytes. Gatorade you need if you get the flu or something. Yeah. I just had a pretty wicked stomach virus. You did? Yeah. It's going around, guys. Listen, fans, if you're out there, don't get the stomach flu. This is the Come Town Health Minute. Yeah. Did you see that thing the Red Cross did? They really said like, Red Cross got in trouble this week because they put like a pool safety just some fucking pool safety poster that they like tweeted out. It's a picture of a pool with like things you should do in the pool versus things you shouldn't do in the pool. So it's like someone running, and it's pointing at the kid running, and it says not cool, and then it's like a guy holding his baby, and it says cool. But every one of the not cool ones is a black person. Oh my God. Is it a real picture? Is it like a brown cartoon? Yeah. It'd be great if it was just, because then you couldn't complain if it was just a photograph someone happened to take of a pool, and all the black people happened to be doing breaking all the rules. You can't help that. That's not the Red Cross this week. The cartoons were all brown. It's the white guys who weren't breaking any of the rules. And you know what's funny is like Shackleford made all these people mad at the Red Cross. There is absolutely no way in hell that was on purpose. Right. No way. There's no way at all. Yeah. But what's so funny is that they were like, they probably did one draft and they're like, ah, put more black people in there so people don't get mad at us for like not being diverse enough. And then that backfire. Yeah. Imagine if it was some guy who was like, this is how I get him. This is how we set him back. Finally. This is last day. Their favorite place, the pool. That's where. This is like when that guy tweeted that picture, the United Airlines account tweeted that picture of the woman with the toy plane in her car with the plane. That was awesome. That's the best way to quit your job. I love the auto fucking when someone has their shit set up for auto retweets and it just like the Beatles fucking suck dick. The Beatles retweet it. I love seeing that shit. Corporate Twitter accounts are still figuring it out. Remember that. What was the makeup account? There's some makeup company when the Aurora shooting happened in Colorado and they were like Aurora's trending. That must be our new Aurora makeup. Yeah. And then the makeup they tweeted. Guess what guys? It was the Joker makeup. They tweeted the Joker makeup. They tweeted out a tutorial of how to do your own Joker makeup. We had a bunch planned today, but we wiped it clean because there's a big news event on Friday dropped. Oh, right. Of course. Brexit. Is that how you pronounce it? What do you say? I thought it was Brechie. Brechie? Well, it's about Europe. Brechie, the first book of the Torah. Alright, you don't have to do all these Jew jokes that we don't get. I'm sorry. Neither of us have read the Torah. Sorry. Sorry. There aren't any Jews. Was there a Jew version of C.S. Lewis books? I was so pissed off when I found out that those were all like Christian. I know. Yeah. I was like, what? I thought you made up all this cool shit about me into liking this shit. A big mouse that does sword fighting and it's like that's Paul or something. Yeah. Jesus was the lion. Clearly the lion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that shit is so fucking gay, dude. I hate when I get tricked into liking Christian. Oh, man. I saw that. Sorry. I just remember I did extra work on Jermaine Fowler's sketch comedy show like a year ago. Friends of the people. Yeah. And so I don't know if have either of you been extras in anything? No, no, it's the funniest. I'm always the fucking star on the start of show. It's the funniest shit in the world. So like all the people that, most of the people doing extra work, it's like, it's actually, it's an easy job. Yeah. And if you're a union, you get like 150 bucks a day and you mostly just sit around. If you like freelance or something, it's great. You bring your laptop, you can like just write. That's awesome. Yeah. You don't really have to do shit. You're in like a scene for maybe like five seconds. Oh, that's cool. Do they feed you? Yeah, you get free food, you know, and then 10% of the people there. Okay. So yeah, like 89% of the people are, you know, just like just know what's up 10% are, you know, trying to be serious actors and 1% are like bat shit insane. Just like there was this one time I was in, in holding for a show and there's this woman with like aviator sunglasses on rail thin like anorex is like very tall, lanky, you know, there's veins everywhere, just very vascular, creepy woman. She's like hunched over like a fucking gargoyle on her chair. And some guy was like, Oh, well, my friend David Richards, he's a writer. He's like talking to somebody quietly and from across from him, she goes, Oh, yeah, I know him. He raped me. Oh, Jesus. Yeah, I know him. He raped me back in the 80s. What are we supposed to do with that? And then they start talking. She's like, Oh, never mind. This must be a different guy. Was he a manager at a Chili's in New York? The only set job I've had is the one you got me when we're truck boys, truck boys, dude. Well, didn't you have a good extra? Well, I was about to tell I was about to tell an extra story. I forget what the fucking lead into it was. I think we're talking about that. Oh, yeah, the Jesus allegory thing. But there was this one guy that friends of the people thing, who just had like 90s asshole hair, you know, like both, like both of his parents were named Zach. Like a fucking, like always wearing eyes, odd, like like penis, 90s penis, which is a very like, like a very nicely shaped glands helmet of hair. And like any time they would call cut, he would immediately turn and face the camera and you could see him on all the monitors and no one's paying attention. Oh, my God, just trying to fucking ignore him. And and then I had to fucking listen to Oh, yeah. So I went into I forgot what okay, yeah, we're sitting and holding and one of the producers comes in and like they tell us like, Okay, guys, so basically the sketch idea is like, I don't want to shit on the show or whatever. I mean, but like, they're just telling you the pitch of the sketch. So it's like, even even if the funniest show in the world, they just tell you like, here's the idea. You're like, Okay, you're not going to laugh at it. Right. Whatever. It's just that, you know, they're just telling you, you know, what's going on. Yeah, yeah. So she's like, Okay, so basically the setup is like, you know, they're throwing a house party and the president shows up, Barack Obama shows up and he eats all the food. And again, I don't want to shit on the show. Why are you privacy? And then this guy, he like leans in, he physically leans in and he's like, Oh, wow, that's so great. And I had to like, you know, step out of the room for a second to like, you know, call him a slur under my breath. I want to laugh at him. And I come back in and the producers talking to him and she goes, No, President Obama won't actually be here. He thought the president of the United States is going to pop in is going to do a quick drop in or spend a day shooting a sketch where he eats too many Cheetos for true TV. But yeah, no, we were leaving. So we're in like a van back to the city or whatever at the end of the day. And like, somebody was talking about something. And you know, he's like, Well, what is your favorite film? And they were like, Oh, the matrix or something. And that guy goes, You know, that that whole story is actually an allegory for Jesus Christ. Hell, yes, he starts describing the matrix parallels. I mean, it's sort of this, he's not wrong. Yeah, no, those three are chosen. Oh, of course. I mean, isn't the license plate like a, yeah, it's like a biblical reference. We can't criticize it because they're both trans though. Oh, are they? Oh, yeah. So is it the Wachowski sisters? Yes. Well, no, you just sit down. You just say the Wachowskis. Does that they're a chosen pronoun? Yeah, just what are the odds the pronouns? What are the odds? It's really, let me ask you this, though. Do you think they would have transitioned if the second two movies have been better? If they had been better movies, as good as the first one, they're sitting with their PR guy, and they're like, Look, we need to get a little traction right now. You said we wouldn't have to if they never got funding for the animatrix. Would they have transitioned? I watched a speed racer, their speed racer on mushrooms once and it was intense. So scary. I mean, I had to turn it off. I tried watching super jail on mushrooms. I don't know why I thought that would be a good idea. Isn't that the show that on purpose fucks with you? Like, yeah, it's like, even when you're sober, you're like, you feel kind of disturbed. It's great. It's one of the best things I've ever seen. But yeah, I tried watching that on mushrooms. I had to leave the room. That was too much. Yo, you remember Jose extreme parking? Oh God, that guy was the best. We'll talk about Jose real quick. All right. So Nick, Nick gets me a job. He's like, you just got to sit in the passenger seat of this truck. That's basically it. And then we got to move things like a couple times, but you just hang out on this truck in the middle of the day. They're like, Yeah, we're going to need you to get your own 16 foot truck and drive it around man. Just alone, just in a massive. Oh, you were alone. But yeah, they split us up for starters. The truck they made us pick up. It was like a 20 foot truck and normally trucks are 14 foot right and like a 20 foot truck. You don't need a CDL until it reaches like, I don't know. It's a weight thing, but basically like a 30 foot truck. Right. But the difference between 14 and 20 feet, when you're driving that truck, because they're wider too. Yeah, you get in that thing and you're like, I shouldn't be driving this fucking truck, especially around Manhattan. Yeah, I'd feel weird driving in like the fucking Baltimore suburbs in the middle of fucking and you guys were right in the mix. We had a we're like in midtown driving these massive trucks. Yeah, I just like my way into this job and they said, I just have to sit in the past. It's not even a lying thing. They don't give a shit. They don't give a fuck. They don't give a shit. They hire whoever. It's like, yeah, I got a friend, Brent, he'll do it. And then it's like, okay, we'll go pick up $2 million worth of camera and a lighting equipment. They're like, no, we already signed for it and then just park the truck wherever they don't even like give you instructions on where to. So yeah, so like we had a five a.m. call. They're like, yeah, it's our responsibility to park the trucks. And so like we're supposed to park them in like, you know, lots or whatever. We had a five a.m. call. There's this dude that's just like wide away. We get there to park the trucks and he's just like screaming at people like moving trucks like air traffic controlling and like I get he like screams at me to move the truck and then I get out and he's like, anyway, man, sorry, I yelled at you. My name is Jose. I'm a small business owner. I own my own company. It's called Extreme Parking. He didn't he didn't tell us he showed us his business because we struck up a conversation with them. They like hire somebody and this guy's only job is to just sit outside all night before the shoot and put up traffic cones so like nobody will take the parking space, which is like a shooting in New York. You'd need someone to totally. It's also that parking coordinate. This guy has legal, right? No, it's not. No, you get permits from the streets. But the way the permits work is they don't say that you can't park there. It just allows you to hold the parking space. Gotcha. Gotcha. So if somebody wanted to come and take that parking space, they could. Gotcha. And that's why you have like a cone guy. So this guy's business is he owns the cones. He's the cones guy. He just owns the business. Well, he shows us his business card and it says Extreme Parking on it. Jose Extreme Parking. And it took everything I had not to like. That's incredible. Excuse me. They have a website. I found the website. I have to take it over last. Anyway, so he's like bragging to us. We're like, yeah, so like are the parking guys in New York like Union? Like that's what you ask every job on a film shoot is like, are you Union or not? Because that's like, you know, an easy conversation starter. And he's like, hell no doing never going Union. I'm never going Union, bro. He's like, yeah, man, I raised like six kids. I raised like nine, nine, nine. I read exaggerated in the wrong direction. Yeah, yeah, that's crazy. He's like, I raised nine kids. Last year, Extreme Parking made $85,000 and like split between me and my five guys. We asked him, we asked him, he's like, I made $90,000 last year. And I was like, that's pretty good. Is that before after tax? He's like, well, split between me and my like a guy. I'm like, that's no money. No way I'm going Union, man. No way I'm going Union, bro. I've raised nine kids on this. It's so fucking on this parking game. Yeah, holy shit. What is he feeding those fucking kids, dude? I don't know, man, but production is the funniest job for meeting those kinds of people. Oh, it's the best. The other the other extra. I did extra work on blue bloods. Oh, yeah. Tom Selleck. Do you see Tom Selleck? No, but I saw Donnie. Oh, hell yeah. I saw Don. There was this fucking guy there, this older black dude who was like in his like, probably he was probably in his early sixties. Okay. And you know, he clearly had taken illicution lessons or at least knew how to approximate them. Because, you know, he's like always had his fucking eyebrows vaulted, you know, like speaking in a, you know, very like area diet way or whatever, but then bull shit. It was bullshit. And like the minute I saw this guy when we're sitting and holding, I'm like, I'm going to listen everywhere this guy has to say. Yeah. Also, a lot of the extras, they have their own cop outfits because they do extra work so much. They go and buy in the police officer outfits. I come with my uniform. No, that's what they do because it's like you can get a job as like, you know, the guy that's permanently a police officer on the background and like CSI or whatever. Hell yeah. So we're there and he finds this girl. I forget her name. We'll call her Gabby. And she was like younger, like kind of attractive, but not TV attractive, you know, like she's like, yeah, I'm trying to become an actress, you know, that's what I want to do is I want to be an actress. And it's like, you know, I mean, whatever, she's 19. So she has time to like, figure out that, you know, don't be an actress. Yeah. And this Lawrence guy immediately hones in on her because it's someone that he can spew all of his bullshit to God. And, you know, like I'm trying to remember a couple of the hits, but, you know, there was a good one in there where he's like, you know, I mean, I show up on these sets and you know, I'm ready to go, you know, and I had the one time they say to me, Lawrence, you know, we need you to move up and we need you to speak a couple of lines in this one. And I say, I'm ready. I can do that. But they, they give me just my sides. And I say, well, I'm going to need the whole script. I didn't need to understand my character's motivations. What is he feeling in this situation? You know, like, and the line is like, yeah, has anybody seen the coffee maker? Yeah, it's never went that way. And he's like, I need to know my motivations. And then, you know, it's like, everything's like, just filled with all this like bitterness. There's like a subtext of, you know, jealousy and anger. And there's one time he was like, I just heard him in his sock and he's like, and I told her, you know, you know, I mean, next time you're going to be working for me, I'll be producing on the next one, I'll be directing, you know, you're going to be working for me. So, you know, no, you can't talk to me that way. I forget who said the line, but one of favorite lines is, I'm going to show them who's never been boss. And I think that applies. I think that applies to Lawrence. But so he's going off about, you know, the whole time, one time he's saying, you know, I've been here since season one, I've been working here on this project together since season one. It's like, you know, you've just been booked as an extra for seven years. Yeah, on Blue Bloods. The show with 19 grandads, where everyone has a mustache. Yeah. The mustache granddad show. Yeah. So it's like Tom Selleck is supposed to play the patriarch on that show. He's like, cop granddad, and then his son like has a son. So he's like the great, he's the granddad. And then Tom Selleck's dad is on the show too. So there's another grandpa. Jesus Christ. Really? There's like, is that many grandpas? Nine generations of Irish cops. But the guy who plays Tom Selleck's father on the show is only like three years older than Tom Selleck in real life. Because it doesn't make any fucking sense. But so after like a whole day of Lawrence going off about how much, you know, everybody loves him or whatever, he started, he's like, you know, me and Donnie have been working on this project for years together. Donnie Wahlberg shows up, you know, nobody's seen Donnie yet. I'm like, oh, that's pretty cool. It's Donnie Wahlberg. And he walks by and Lawrence sees him and he goes, good morning, Donnie. And Donnie Wahlberg takes one look at this man and goes, been seeing too much of you around here, Lawrence, just walks away. Been seeing too much of you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was completely annoying. And then he goes, he like turns to that girl and he's like, we play games with each other. We like to joke around with each other. Oh, boy. Oh, man. Okay. So if we're talking about like career extras, I feel, I mean, Tommy Myers is coming up again. Have you guys seen his acting real? He's like an investigation. Yeah, it's like he's a priest. And like an investigation. He looks surprised. He looks like he learned the motions from like emojis. Yeah. He learned how to react to things. Okay. Well, I'm supposed to have dollar signs in my eyes. What is the dollar sign tongue emoji all about? I can put your money where your mouth is, dude. I took me years to figure that out. Yeah, that's incredible. Good for you, man. So Tom, your motivation in this scene is I want you to imagine that your character is confused. He's just been hit with all this information about this missing girl. It's almost like I want you to imagine that you've just had like a bong hit. Okay. So Tom, you're carried. So you're in the hospital, Tom. You're in the hospital. You just had a bong hit. The EKG is beeping next to you. Okay. So there were complications during your bong hit. Tom, first of all, thank you for being a part of the reboot of West Wing. I'm so happy you're here. So basically in this scene, you know, it's a walk and talk scene and you are there next to Madam President and you're walking down the hallway of the West Wing and then, you know, you have to eat her pussy. If you can do that for us. She wants to get revenge on Bill. Tom, I want you to imagine. Okay. So pretend like you've smoked pot before. Imagine you're Paul Revere and you're on pot. I think the British are coming, dude. The British are coming, man. So the Brexit, what do you guys think? Oh, of course. Oh, Brashi. Well, man, it's just, you know, I don't know. That's one of those things I didn't fucking pay attention to. They said they were going to do it and they did it. I look at my friends reacting to it on Twitter. I'm like, I guess I'm supposed to be mad about this. I don't I don't even know what the EU is really. I just thought it meant you don't have to get a work visa if you want to like work. Yeah, it's easy. That doesn't apply to me. It doesn't mean shit to me. I think it does feel like too much shit. That's like a little weird is happening recently. Like I could this could be just something this happens and then some fucking there's a skirmish you think like a Trump like some something fucked up. I feel like I don't know it. This is the first time I've been like that's weird. That's a fucked up. I'll just say the worst part of the Brexit for me is my dad called me four times on Saturday. Dad calls you about everything though with Brexit puns and it was like I was I was living in an absolute eternal hell. Damn, dude. Terrible. That must suck having a loving father bitch. This bitch has a good relationship with his parents. Haha. What do you mean? What do you mean? That's the first time you think like a fuck. Now I'm calling you on my dad's birthday yesterday. That's hilarious. I gotta call my fucking father. Shit. How's it? I dude, I could not tell you. I think Jesus Christ, man. Come on. You can't even eyeball it or he's 63. That makes sense. That's like my dad's age. My dad's turning 65 this month. My dad's like 63. Alright, let's see. I'm 27. He was 35 when he had me. 64, right? No, that doesn't make sense. 62. Because my dad was like 36 when I was born and he's like 63. 62. Yeah, that's what I'll say. Your dad's gotta be a year younger than my dad. Okay. Because I'm older than you. Yeah, but my dad could fuck your dad's bitch ass up, dude. What if me, my dad and your dad like kissed back in elementary school. They practice kissing on each other and that's how they met our moms. Dude, that's what if we parent trap all three of our dads to be gay? So we'd be real brothers. Your dad would, I feel like your dad would be a bottom. My dad's a top. Yo, check this out. What if our dad's... Your dad's a top? No. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Your dad's American. My dad was... He's a Monty Kong. Monty Kong. My dad is a Monty Kong. Your dad's a fucking couple. My dad's a Wachowsky. The worst joke... A little wig on him? Throw a dreadlock wig on him? The worst joke pitch I ever got from him. I was like... He called like four times. I called him back and he's like, comedy is over. Comedy is over. And I'm like, what are you talking about? He's like, his name is Wiener and he showed his Wiener. And I was like, I gotta go. I have to go. That is a pretty good name. Leave me alone, please. What happens to dads that they just become horribly fucking unfunny? Yeah, even like professional comedian dads. Like at like 65. Like, I don't know what happens. As soon as you become a father, the two things happen. You stop being funny and you start having to scream when you yawn. Yeah. I don't understand what that is. Like you can't just fucking yawn like a normal person. You just start screaming. Like a deaf person having an orgasm. You guys are lucky, though, that sorry to make this Jew again. But your dads don't go through one of those like make like just getting obsessed with Israel things. Like just getting angry and shouting at you. Yeah, but everybody's dad's racist about something. Well, your guys dads get into cool stuff like trains and stuff. Yeah, my dad's into trains. My dad's like really developed autism at age like 61. His wife took him to like a train museum for his birthday a couple years ago. And he's like trying to show me a train video on his like phone and I almost had to go cry. Oh my God. I was like, I feel so bad for you, dude. What's happening? My father became a crazy cat man. I'm not even kidding. So he's got he's a carbon. He's got his own like fucking place. And I went in there to visit him, dude. There was at least 15 cats. Just you just had fucking is all Greek dudes. Huh? Is all Greek dudes working the spot. It's just his fucking spot. It's just that Hemingway. Your dad's like Hemingway. Yeah, maybe we'll fucking shoot himself. Shoot himself in the face and open. Yeah. And get all that cat money, dude. Yeah, I could get I could fucking inherit all those cats. Hemingway was so dumb. Why? Why do people like hot take? I don't know. Hot take. I've never enjoyed his right. Oh, I'm incredible. I went to Africa and I murdered an animal. I'm gonna write a fucking whole story about people. Yeah. Oh, this is incredible. Have you ever went to Africa and he murdered an animal? You know that short story that what is it? The short symbol of Francis McComer? Is that Hemingway? It's a Hemingway short story that's like the most like like Pua MRA. Really? Yeah. So the story is like this guy goes to Africa with his hot wife to like hunt a lion. But then there's this just fucking big dick swinging like hunter that's already there that like has to take them out into the field. And this guy's like a stuck up like, you know, cuts him. Yeah, well, yeah, he does. So they go out to, you know, to hunt and he like takes his like, you know, disaffected, you know, like disillusioned wife out into the field with him so she can watch him do a safari or whatever to to like want to fuck him again. Yeah. And they go out. Well, not at this point in the story, they're just sort of like in a, you know, a malaise, they're like upper middle class people or whatever he's like, we're going on safari and they go out into the into the, you know, the field or whatever. And there's like a rhino or something. And the guy tenses up and he can't shoot the rhino. He's like a coward about it or whatever. He's a bitch. And the hunter has to save them. And the hunter saves them. And then there's like the next scene is like, the guy's in his tent at night and he hears his wife go like fuck the other guy. Yeah. He just sits there like all mad while the wife's like fucking the other guy. And then she comes back and he's like all pissed off. He's like, I can't believe you fucking did that or whatever. So the next day they go out and there's a fucking lion dude. And he's like, I'm going to kill that lion. And he goes out and even the hunter is like, don't do it, man. You know, like, don't kill the lion. And he like goes out in the field and then he like shoots once and shoots twice. And he's missing or whatever. And then finally there's like one last shot. I mean, like the lion drops, but he drops too. And the wife had like stood up and she shot like him in the back of the head. He became a man, but then his fucking bitch killed him anyway. Yeah, that sounds like some pretty relatable. That sounds I mean, that sounds a lot like that old joke. We're like, yeah, just like imagine Hemingway sitting it as like fucking typewriter. And then that fucking she did and not me. I got a fucking hard six and a half. That's average, dude. That's fucking average. No one can tell you it's not average. Average means good. Yo, you know that old joke though about the guy that goes to Africa to kill the lion? No, poor old. He thinks it's a Cadillac. Is that one? No, no, no, he goes out to kill the lion and he sits back and he unloads, he unloads on like bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, the dust settles. The lion's still staying there and the lion goes up to him and he's like, you know, you missed me. So I'm going to give you a choice like either you, I'm going to eat you or you can suck my dick. So he's like, all right, I'm going to suck your dick, right? And then the next season, whatever he goes out, he sees the same line, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, dust settles. It's like, you missed me. You're going to have to, I'm going to eat you or you're going to have to suck my dick. And then like the third season, obviously, he's like out there and he's like, yeah, the lion like comes up to him and he's like, he's seeing his life flash before his eyes and he looks him square in the eyes and he's like, you must really like sucking my dick. My grandfather told me that. That doesn't make any fucking sense. I thought the project was going to be something like you want to just skip it. I don't know. I don't know what. I thought that was like a very well-known old joke. That's like, oh, I've never heard that. My grandfather told me that joke. It doesn't make any sense. It makes no sense. That was like, there used to be a joke about his life or something. Like a genie when I was like in middle school. It was like, you get two wishes. The first was like, I want to suck another guy's dick. That's what Mike asked for. That's like the punchline is like somebody being gay, being gay, but there's a genie involved. Oh yeah. I remember there was, there was a fucking, yeah, there was another one where it was like a gorilla. It's like, we'll give you, they told this poor zookeeper, we'll give you $80,000 to get fucked in the ass by this gorilla. And he's like, there's like for $80,000 to get fucked in the ass to the gorilla. He's like, all right, I'll do it, but you're going to have to give me some time to come up with $80,000. That was like a fucking joke. I used to tell on buses. On that one, all right, Peter. All right, Peter. You got to plug that. I'm sorry, man. I miss you so fucking much. God damn it. Every day, it's getting a little better, but it's been a long day without you, my friend. Well, I think we got, this is a good first chunk. What do you want to do? Yeah, sure. I mean, we can just go through. We don't need to have. You want to go through? Yeah, we'll just keep doing. I got a pee. Oh, you got a pee? Okay, then we'll take a break and then we'll come back. Is there anything else we wanted to riff on before you guys have got any zingers in there over the last time? The Brexit, dude. I can't get over it. How about this Boris Johnson? It looks like fucking Trump. Yeah. Yeah, they got the same hair. Huh? He looks like Boris Becker, dude. Uh-oh. Becker, good show. Ted Danson. That blind guy. Brexit, Danson, Becker, Johnson, we made it. We brought it all full suckle. And you know who else was on Cheers with Ted Danson was Frazier. Frazier from earlier. Which we also mentioned in the show. I'm gay, Niles. We fuck aliens. It's so funny how callbacks work. I know. How does it feel like a comic will be on stage in 45 minutes in their act? A bit like egg sandwich anyone? He said that 25 minutes ago. Why do you think, I think legitimately it's because like it's the same reason that roasts work, right? Because everyone laughs when you're making fun of a celebrity because it's like a common experience. Like hating Justin Bieber is something that we all feel or something. Supposedly I don't give a fuck about Justin Bieber. So yeah, it's like, oh yeah, we shared that joke 20 minutes ago. That's why we look more classic. I think it honestly is just like the first time that happens, it's fucking weird and funny. So you laugh. And then if you have two jokes that have the same punchline, it's a funny coincidence. So it's like, oh, this is that's fun. But now people just like, I think he's right. I think it has to do with like the communal aspect or whatever. You know what I think that's why like a lot of like, why newer comedy or stuff online that's like you can't really understand the structure of it. Like what makes Sam Hyde so funny? Why that can't appeal? Why you could never do that on stage just because it's like necessarily individual. There's no like community there. It's just like one guy's fucking weird personality. All comedy like on the internet like memes is like, do be comedy, like not like joint, but like, yeah, people do be like that, you know, teachers. It's all for me. You just plug in whatever you want. Because like, oh, that time when the teacher looking at you and you like, you know, it's all like, oh, yeah, that's just what they teach you. When I was like 17, my friend Brendan used to hang out with like these kids that we just hated. We like didn't like any others. And like, I wasn't there for it. But Brendan was telling me about it. Like one of them was like showing everyone on his laptop, this picture of it's like SpongeBob SquarePants, but his eyes are all red. And he's got a bong and like probably behind them. And it's you know, it's like SpongeBob hemp pants. SpongeBob weed pants. And they're dying. And this one kid goes, oh, man, I got to show my dad this. My dad will love this. Dad sucks. That's like worse than if you he was just like, yeah, my dad molested me. It's on par with that. And that's how much of a slip up that was proto memes. Spongebong weed pants. Dude, I can't believe David Cameron fucked up so bad guys that breaks it. Yeah, that was crazy. How did it? How do you go from directing tight? Didn't he fuck a pig in the mouth? Didn't that come out a couple years ago that he fucked a pig's mouth? Is that what the black mirror was about? I think black mirror might have like made some illusions or nor or maybe that even came out after black mirror that when he was at Cambridge or Oxford or whatever, he was in some like secret society where he had to fuck a pig in the mouth. He didn't even that just went away and he was allowed to continue being the prime. Do you see at the speech where he said sorry and then quit? Yeah, that's pretty funny though. It'd be like, all right, well, that's pretty good. That's on par with Nixon's just like, that was awesome. See you. See you. The peace signs. He literally, he's rolled on his way out. It was awesome. That was the best thing he's ever done. He's fucking jowl shaking. That was awesome. All right, ain't you was going to be at the party? I don't want Jews at the party. Did you read that the book with all the transcripts in it? Well, we were going to do that as well. Yeah, we're going to do that podcast. Yeah, we were going to do a Nixon secret tape podcast where we'd get like people to like play Kissinger and like whatever. Yeah, it's not bad. And you just do excerpts from the tapes. We can do a little like how that goes from being like, you know, it'd be a funny idea to actually being something. Yeah, we try to come up with bits and we do them. And it's like, all right, that was a minute and 22 seconds long. And I use three racial slurs. I guess. Dude, we got some great character work in the past. I mean, this will be the rest of this, there will be no character work for sure. No one will be doing any characters, but we've done in the past some pretty good character stuff. I think there are a couple characters that I think we've done on this podcast. I think I hope Lauren Michaels isn't listening. Yeah, Lauren is listening. Yeah, we came up with Dr. Evil. We wrote Doc Evil. Hey, it's me, the family guy. That's our other character is the family guy. Hey, I'm trying to eat a sandwich. I'm freaking a fat guy. I'm a freaking fat family guy. I want a sandwich over here. A freaking sandwich. Is family guy guy gay? I'm gay. Totally. I'm Farland. Absolutely. And I feel like he's one of those gay guys that like feels like he missed the opportunity to come out of the closet. So he just really likes musicals. Well, he's just like, I feel like that's probably a problem that gay guys have now where it's like, you had a window to come out of the closet and now you're just old and you're like, everybody already assumes I'm gay. I don't know if I should say anything or what. That was right after right when the Orlando shooting happened, the Matilda girl. Mara Wilson was like posting on Facebook. She's like, by the way, guys, I'm queer. I don't know if you know that she like to use that day to be like, I'm queer, not gay queer, which just means that like, you know, I got my hair cut short one time. Exactly. Oh man, I was at Pride the other day and I saw, you know what I love? Sucking off guys. Well, yeah, it's Pride, dude. Not Prude. It's Pride. You gotta have fun. Damn, Fleet Week. Fleet Week is a real Pride. That's the real Pride. That is, those are the most prideful men. It's a semen outfit. They're called semen. They're literally called semen. There has to have been a hat comic that made a joke about like people thinking that it's like white pride or whatever, right? No, but I'll take it. I call that one. All right, that's yours. That's all yours, man. You guys see these Donald Duck racists out here? They're all dressed like Donald Duck and they're white supremacists. So, yeah, no, is it Pride? And there's, you know, like, it's all like people that are naked or whatever and they're like kissing each other. It's like expressing sexuality. And I swear to God, I was walking down the street and in the middle of like the parade and like one of those like East or West 10th, there's a fucking like probably homeless older black lady, like in her like, you know, early 70s, rail thin, you know, like kind of like an emaciated crack body. Correct. And she's in a wheelchair and she's got her like jeggings pulled down over her like, you know, the diameter of her legs was probably like four inches each. She's like beanpole leg. Jesus Christ. And she got her, her jeggings pulled down. She's masturbating with both hands. And she's like, oh my God, oh my, oh my fucking God. And she's fucking just robbing her postie and everyone's just trying to ignore it, like shielding their eyes and trying to run. I'm like, why doesn't she have her own float? This is what should, this should be in the parade. Can we get her? Can she be the grand marshal? This is the most powerful display of sexuality of anything here. What? We're supposed to be proud of some fucking hot 20 year old girl with pasties on her perfect tits to give this woman a fucking TV show. Rip to Jarhead guy with like an ultimate warrior, like, like rubber bands around tassels or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So she that I love that too, because she's probably just beating off to all the gay dudes. Oh yeah. That's what she was doing. She was just staring at all these men and masturbating. Just looking incredible. I got a piece of it. All right, we're going to take a break and then we got a real sweet treat for you after break. Oh, we better thank you something. All right. See you guys. The day after tomorrow. A time when criminals rule the city. The only weapon that can stop them needs a driver. A man without a memory can be supplied with a cosmetical tuning and be our driver. Let's initiate change over. Three, two, one. Activate. The most wanted man on wheels is about to change sides. Now against a corrupt system, a lone fight for justice. Viper is taking back the streets. Folks, the boys are back in town. Brockman Turner overdrive live in studio. But some sad news. All right, I guess we're I'm just going to abandon. Oh, you guys got nothing for that? I wasn't going anywhere with that. Oh yeah. It was it was been Lizzie that's saying that song. Well, boys are back in town. Yeah, yeah. No, it's not. Yes, it is. Oh, it is. You're right. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. But in Ireland's own. Yeah. Look, dude, we're all a little frazzled. We just yeah. No, we got terrible news, terrible news. Guys, we found out, you know, and I know this is going to, you know, be weird, you know, like tonally. Before you say it, can you just like be responsible, like be like honor, honor what we're about to say, like do it with honor and not no jokes. And yeah, I won't make any jokes, I guess. I mean, I do feel partially responsible. I guess I was kind of mean to him, but it was like a freak accident. But Seth Dickfield, who you guys may or may not know, he's come on the podcast sometimes. Have you met him? Um, no, actually, I haven't. But we've had like sort of like, I guess, you know, like, you know, like an intense, you know, back and forth, I guess, a little bit. I mean, I was a little annoyed that he came on my show and he caused, you know, some grief with another guy. I know a good friend of yours. Yeah, a guy that I'm, you know, I'm pretty good friends with that I've known for years. Just guy, well, I mean, we've known each other for 10 years, you know, since he was like about 30, he's, he's near 40 now. So that's how long I've known him is that he's almost 40 years old now. But, uh, yeah, Seth Dickfield, unfortunately was, he was on vacation in Europe last week and he, he was visiting Auschwitz, uh, just to see the sites and take it in. And he slipped on a banana peel and cracked his head open on one of those novelty penny smashing machines and he died. I can't, I can't deal with this man. And I know it sounds like that's a very funny way to die. Yeah, especially considering he's not even Jewish. He's not, but it's, it's the actual way he died. I know that like, like that guy from Star Trek that died, you know, like everyone was pretty chill about not making jokes about the ridiculous way. Yeah, don't laugh at it, dude. I'm sorry. There's nothing funny about Anton Yelchin being crushed by his Jeep while trying to check his mail by driving over himself. There's nothing funny about this. It's not funny. I can't do this, man. And it is not funny to that there's a steakhouse themed, there's a, there's a Holocaust themed steakhouse that's not funny. It's not funny that Seth was there. And then guys, I can't, this tone is too light. I can't do this, man. I don't want to disrespect the dead. I got to go, man. I'm sorry. All right. Well, luckily, luckily, we have, we have someone here to, you know, send Seth off. Oh, no. Yeah. Oh, what's up? Everybody, please welcome Ralph Ralforowski, Seth Dickfield's cousin. My beautiful cousin, Seth. Yeah. Yo, this is a saddest day of my fucking life since the O's lost to the fucking Kansas City Royals and the fucking A.L. Champions of the Year. Yo, the fucking good ones always go early, yo. You know, um, that's true. The guys always go early. The gold ones, the gold ones always go early. The gold ones, the gold ones, yo, please do not fucking tagging us right now, yo. I just lost my fucking baby cousin, yo. I will not have this right now, yo. He's grieving. I'm grieving, yo. What are the fucking seven stages of grief fucking sadness, denial, beating up a fucking Judah talks to you funny. You know what I mean, buddy? And right now I'm getting close to number three right now. Okay. I'm sorry. Let me mourn my fucking cousin, yo. I'm sorry, Ralph. We're here for you. Yo, I don't know, dude. It's tough, man. This is tough. Now my family, now we got to find a new gay cousin to make fun of, yo. Yo, I think it's going to be my cousin, Mark, who cried during 9-11, you know. You know, that's not the kind of family we are, yo. We are vengeance family, yo. We find some seeks and we beat them up afterwards. We don't fucking cry about that shit. So Mark is, but it could be, you know, it could be who knows, man. Is there, is there going to be a funeral for Seth? Yeah, there's going to be a funeral. We're going to, we're going to stuff his body up into a crab cake. Are you getting him taxidermied? Yeah, we're going to get him taxidermied and we're going to actually, we're going to put him just in the den in Uncle Mark's den where it was his favorite place to visit. And we're just going to, we're going to put a stealer, put a stealer's jersey on him and we're going to give him the finger just like for a little sake. That's how we want to remember him as a guy we fuck with. Was he a big stealers fan? No, he wasn't. We would actually hold him down and we would toss stealers memorabilia onto him and then we would send him out into, we would send him out into the streets of Baltimore and we would tell people he loved the stealers and then people would come to acts of hate against him and also we would tell them he was gay. And could you, I mean, I know it's tough in a tragedy like this that you didn't, you obviously feel like you were robbed of the opportunity to say goodbye and to say yeah, if you could say something to Seth right now, like, what, what would you say? I would say, Seth, yo, don't be doing no gay shit in heaven, yo, because I'm about to be up there and I'm about to be finger popping some bitches. And if they hear if Marilyn Monroe hears that I got a gay fake Jew cousin, yeah, that might fuck my shit up. You know what I'm saying? That's who you're going for in heaven, Marilyn. Marilyn. Yeah, well, yeah, Marilyn Monroe. This, um, yeah, is fucking cross-eyed black girl from Dundalk High School that was killed in junior year. Her name was, is there a different Marilyn? Yeah, yeah. She sucked my dick out back behind a Mars once while I was eating fucking burger cookies. Oh, you're, you know, you go back for doubles. So I'm going back. So don't be fucking my shit up with Marilyn. I know she got that good heaven body up here now, Seth. What do you think Seth would do if he had one more day on this earth? Honestly, yo, I think he will probably get on Grindr and then such a guy and then be about to meet up and then delete his account real quick because he realizes he's still in the closet and he didn't know what he would do if anybody ever found that he was gay. I think if he had one last time on this earth. Do you think, do you think Seth would get bullied off of Grindr, perhaps? Yeah, I can see that definitely. Some of my, some of my make fun of Seth on Grindr and he has to delete his account. Yeah, I can see that. Cause he got PTSD. Yeah. Yeah, he's gotten PTSD before you. Um, but you gave it to him. You gave him PTSD by teasing him. Well, well, that's how, that's how that's what family does. Yeah. That's the kind of family we was. Yeah. So I, um, I actually, when I heard the news about Seth, I reached out to my friend who lives in Silicon Valley. He's an app developer. Oh my God. And so he does love gay shit like that. Yeah. Yeah. He developed, um, he developed an app. Oh yeah. That it's basically they can create a facsimile of your loved one after they die. Oh my God. So you can just click on the Seth app. Oh my God. I got him to make a Seth one. Are you serious? So we're gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna hook Seth up to the sound board right now. Yeah. And I'm gonna give you the opportunity to say goodbye. Oh my God. To your cousin. Yeah. Okay. Is that all right with you? If you're not, if that's weird to you, I don't, I don't know if I'm ready for this right now, but, um, okay. So I'm gonna just click him in. I'm just gonna. Okay. Uh, hello everybody. It's me. Yes. Hello. I'm not dead anymore. Seth is so good to find. He's inside the phone now. He's in a phone. Yeah. I live in the phone now, everybody. Oh my God. I can always have him in my pocket. Yeah. Seth, yo, hi. It's me, Seth. Seth, do you know how you died? I'm not dead anymore, everybody. Seth, yo, one big ass question, yo. Are these coins in the lost and found for anyone? Seth, listen to me, yo. I'm trying to ask you a serious fucking question, yo. Hello. It's me, Seth. I'm not dead anymore. Seth, you fucking little slut. Shut the fuck up. Yeah. Oh my God, yo. Yo, have you seen my coupon for half off steak? Um, or what, yo? Can I bring my own coupons? Yo, this fucking app sucks, yo. There's some more. Yeah, I don't know. Hi, it's me, Seth. I'm not dead anymore. This is you. Honestly, I'm part of the shit, yo. Fuck. You're ruining the fucking tone. Well, I think you're making a mockery of me, my fucking family. I'm not making a mockery. I just thought I might be nice. I think you're fucking my shit up. I thought it might be nice. Adam, don't use that app anymore. Okay, I'm gonna, all right. I thought it might be nice if you can see your customer. No, that's disrespectful. I mean, even I wouldn't do that. Dude, don't you ever do that. I got half of mine to slap your ass over this fuck. You're lucky I respect Anthony Cumia in the studio too much to do that to you right now. But I feel like. Well, you better calm down because I'll tell you right now, everybody here in the Anthony Cumia studio has a concealed carry permit. Yeah, and I'm all all all the way 100% up there with carrying your own fucking arms. You know, I think honestly, I take my own gun, my gun to a paintball. Yeah, we only got we only got three amendments we care about here in the Anthony Cumia. So number one, free speech, number two, guns, number 27 podcasting, write the podcast. Listen, I think I think we need to send stuff off you. I think we need to say goodbye. I think we need to well, luckily, beautiful as a piece of welcome here. Seth left us a song that he wanted us to play. And we're gonna we're gonna end it on that note and let Seth himself take us out. I'll miss you, Sefio. RIP, Dick Field. RIP. We'll never forget you. I'll miss you, Dick Field. Come town episode eight, the, I don't know, the eighth episode. That's what this one's going to be called. Goodbye, Sef. I love you. I fucking love you. Goodbye, everybody. Hey, everybody. It's me, Seth Dickfield. Hi, it's me, Seth. And now I am dead. And I'll complain all about it when I see you again. It's been a long day fighting Republicans. And I'll complain all about it to none of my friends. I don't have any friends. Goodbye, everybody. I've had a great time here on the podcast, telling everyone about all my various circumcisions and political opinions. And it's been so much fun being woke. But I'm in heaven now, where you go if you're perfect like me and beyond criticism. You know, I know I've complained a lot about the Bernie Blows and the MRAs, but you know, we're all people. I don't remember exactly how this song goes. And I'm not looking at the lyrics. So I just want to reiterate that I'm dead now. I slipped on a banana peel at Auschwitz. And my head hit, oh jeez, it hit one of these penny machines. Oh boy, here comes the loud part of the song again. You know what I can't stand? Loud noises. Some of us have PTSD folks. Some of us got PTSD from being teased as children. I was bullied relentlessly by my 32 older brothers who all hit puberty before me. I've actually never hit puberty. I still don't have puberty. Now I'm up here in heaven with Harambe, the gorilla, and he's been having sex with me. He's been demanding sex, and I have to give it to him, because first of all, it's great to refuse sex if you're a man, and also because he's stronger. And with that folks, I'm gonna have to say goodbye once and for all. And I don't know what, I don't remember this part of the song either. Goodbye, everybody.",

        "transcript_text": " Hey everybody, welcome to Come Town, episode six. Just two of us today. Sorry, seven. Episode seven. Episode seven. Which is just two of us. We're a little, our leader, Nicholas Mullen, is not here. He's actually at a rape joke convention. Yeah, there's a keynote. Daniel Tosh, keynote. Tosh will be in there. Brock Turner, I think, is Skyping in. Nick is going also to an N-word convention, headlined by Kramer next week. So it's, so Nick isn't here. So, but listen, you're going to want to stick with us. Hold up, hold up, hold up. What's up? Weed and boys. That's right. Weed and boys. Did we say I'm Star Wars Hockey? Adam Freedland, Puerto Rican Riles Snake, Puerto Rican. And, but seriously, you are going to want to stick, stick around because we have an incredible, this is our biggest get for sure. We've had some great comics on, but this guy, seriously. I'm pretty stoked about having this guy on the show. He's been in movies. Normally when you guys get famous people, I'm not on the show. But this is the most famous person we've ever had. Exactly. And that's what that means. I'm pretty stoked. So without further ado, Dr. Evil is here. Thank you, Stavros. Thank you, Adam. It's a pleasure to be here at Come Town. We're so happy to have you, Dr. Evil. I mean, I've been a fan for years, really. For years? Yeah, you're too kind. I didn't know you were a real person. I thought you were just from movies. Yeah, a lot of people make that mistake, Adam. They think I'm a silly character, but no, I'm real. You're a real person. With a faint Canadian accent. A very faint Canadian accent, yes. A faint Dr. Evil accent, some people would say. It's almost like I've forgotten my own personality since 2003. What have you been up to? You've been trying to take over the world and stuff? Still trying to take over the world. Really, you haven't made a lot of noise. I've gone into startups, mostly. Evil apps. Perhaps you've heard of Grindr. It's like Tinder, except it's for spreading AIDS. Wow, you're behind Grindr. We make a noise. We dumb boys, dude. Wow, incredible. Wow, we're so happy to have you here, Dr. Evil. I'm happy to be here. Do you know? Do you know how we booked Dr. Evil? How we booked him, Nick Knows him. Nick Knows him? I think he actually saw Nick was using a lot of. I'll tell you how it happened. Oh, yeah, please tell us. I had an email from somebody that Knows that I'm friends with him, and they said, this guy's harassing women online, Joe. Nick? Nick is. Oh, yeah. Oh, no. Oh, yeah. Does he? Oh, yeah. Yeah. And they asked me if I could help getting him fired. Oh, yeah. We got those emails, too, actually. Oh, yeah, yeah. That woman. Sadie Doyle. Sadie Doyle. Don't you know I'm actually enemies with Sadie Doyle? You are, too. Oh. Why is that? So you and Nick have a common enemy? Well, I'm what you call a brochilist. Oh. Maybe you've heard of it. The term? Well, for the listeners at home, who's Sadie Doyle again? She's a journalist. She's my arch nemesis. She's a journalist. A blogist. A blogist. A blogist, yeah. She's a lady who uses computers to spew hatred. Oh. Who does she hate? Every white male comedian, all of them. She has a vendetta, as they would say. Oh, yeah. That's true. Why do you beef with her? What's your problem? You said you're a brochilist. That's correct. Basically we all live in, you know, Skull Mountain castles out in the water. That's very strange, because like I would have assumed if like you were supporting someone in the U.S. election that you wouldn't be supporting, you know, Bernie Sanders. So you must love Bernie. Yeah. Donald Trump. No, I'm actually a Bernie bro, okay. Might think that I'm not, but I am. I love Bernie. I can't get enough of him. Donald, I just don't like his attitude. You don't. Okay. It's too much upfront evil. Yeah, that's true. Not enough subtlety. Yeah. Well, let me see Donald Trump end a sentence with, you know, a long laughing gimmick like we do. Right. Yeah, that's true. Which is your thing. I think that I think that was in the second movie. The one with Beyonce. Oh, yeah. Yeah. In the gold. In the gold outfit. That's the third one. Yeah. Mainly that's why I hate the identity politics people is because Beyonce dared to oppose me. Oh, yeah. That's their queen, right? That's their hero. I just now put it together. Yeah. Wow. That's a good, that's a good bit. Wow. So, okay. So you're, so you're bummed. Bernie's probably gonna pull out soon, right, dude? Well, I'll tell you what, Adam, we're going to find a way to create a new robot Bernie with fricking laser beams in his eyes, in your socialist utopia that you want to sell. In my socialist utopia where we can harass women from the safety of international waters or space. They have a base on the moon where Glenn Greenwald sends me updates on the coordinated harassment campaign to bully women off the internet. That's actually what happened. Glenn sent me an email. He said, hey, Dr. Evil, how you been? Would you mind threatening to rape Sadie online? I'm too busy raping women in Brazil. Wow, really? Yeah. He lives in Brazil with his husband, right? Yeah, sure. They rape women together. This is really great. Wow. Dr. Evil, thank you so much for coming on the podcast, because I know Nick had a bunch of beef last week with Sadie Doyle. She was going in on it. Right. Yeah. I heard about that. Did you see that? He used your image a lot, actually. I actually endorse that. Oh. Do you make all Dr. Evil memes? I was on board. I make every Dr. Evil meme myself. That's really interesting. Wow. That's pretty chill. Well, I tell you what. We're winning the fight against them, but there's one of these people, a newer online account, who I'm mostly worried about. It's this guy, Woke Bastard. Oh, wow. Woke Bastard. You know what? I would love to hear about Woke Bastard, but I really have to go to the bathroom. Oh, stop. We're in the middle of an interview. I know. It's very unprofessional. Stop. You can't leave us. I have to go. I'm so sorry, you guys. I'm going to go. I should be back really soon. All right, DR. I'm sorry. You know, DR, I was wondering, your voice sounds a lot like Caitlyn Jenner. I was just thinking. We had the same kind of surgery on your voice. I take the hormones because I like the flavor. Oh, no. No. This guy. Wow. Oh, no. It's the Woke Bastard. It's Woke Bastard? I'm dead sexy. No, you're not. I'm Woke Bastard. No, you're not Woke Bastard. Yes. There's nothing sexy about you. There's no place for that body negativity here, Dr. Evil. You're too fat to be lovable. Okay. That's not true. Being hot is everybody type. Don't listen to what the patriarch tells you. Wow. That's true. That is. Yeah. That's a good point. I'm hot. I'm dead sexy. And is the difference between Fat Bastard and Woke Bastard? I'm pretty sure they're the same person. I think Fat Bastard is more like less accepting of his body. Exactly. Let me explain. You might not know because you're not. Even though they weren't, you weren't in the scene. There's a very emotional scene where Fat Bastard's sad about being fat. No more. Now I love my body. I love my curves. I know that just because society says I'm disgusting doesn't mean I'm not. I'm lovable. Yes, it does, actually. Take and talk. What you should do is get a tiny clone of yourself that might weigh a fuckable weight. Oh, are you talking about a baby? Yes. So everyone is going to get a clone in your socialist utopia? In my socialist utopia, yes. Everyone gets their own. No, they're going to be baby sized. I'll tell you something, guys. If I had a clone, I just would not stop 69. That's why you get a tiny clone. Because you can't reach. It has to suck your dick, but you don't have to suck it. Like the size of a baby. Oh, like a shrunken clone. I love eating babies. So is Austin Powers still at large? Did you win or did he win? Austin Powers has actually been replaced. Really? I have a new foe by the name of Autism Powers. Autism Powers? Yes. Wow. He sounds pretty cool. Adam, don't you have to go to the bathroom? Not really. I don't have to go to the bathroom. I mean, I can go to the bathroom. I have a phone, actually. I'm getting a call. Oh, wow. Adam's really good at improv. I'm getting a call. I got to go and then I'll be right back in one second. I just don't want to be the only host here. Well, just go. We'll hold down the phone. Yeah, baby. Oh, no. It's Autism Powers. Do trains make you horny, baby? Yeah. He's a lot like Austin Powers, except he's mentally retarded. And I have absolutely no sexual desire for women, baby. That's essentially what the character is. You're lovable just because you're retarded doesn't mean you can't have love. Well, hold on a second, work bastard. You're not allowed to say the R word. I'm doing it ironically. Oh, okay. That's fine. Because I'm woke. It's okay. Yeah, baby. That's not very woke of you, baby. I mean, you might want to stop that, baby. You don't know what the woke is. You better know how to tie your shoes. Anyway, baby, I was at home memorizing every line to every episode of Gilmour Girls. When I heard my arch nemesis, Dr. Evil, was on the come-down P-cast. And I'm here to rest you, Evil. Uh-oh. Yeah, arrest him for his crimes against the blogosphere. Now, frankly, I've done nothing against the autistic community. I don't understand the hatred autism powers. Listen, all of... All of you! What's the wrong with autism powers? Having trouble with your voice over there? I think maybe autism powers ate too many edibles before the podcast. No, baby. I've never smoked weed in my life, baby. I'll tell you what I have eaten, though. Is it pussy? No, baby. That's repulsive, baby. A human pussy. No, baby. I didn't know this stereotype about the autistic that they hated sex. I eat trained pussies, baby. Trains don't have pussies, autism. Well, that's just a matter of perception, baby. Wow. I get in the caboose and I eat that trained pussy. Oh, not long, baby. Well, I'll tell you what. I've got to go. I've got evil plans I have to attend to. Dr. Rievel, get ridden, as far as I'm concerned. No! Thank you for having me. I say goodbye. I can't let you go, baby, without arresting you, baby. Say goodbye to... I gotta put you in jail, baby. Starburst. Autism jail, baby. An adam and a... We'll tell him. Okay, thank you. Who's a starburst? Well, there goes Dr. Rievel. It's just me and you. Well, it's just us, baby. You let him off the hook. You let him off the hook? Here I am, bitch. Oh, my God, baby. It's Caitlyn Jenner, baby. Surprise, girls. Here I am. It's an easier impression to do. It sounds a lot like Dr. Rievel, baby. I can maybe be very similar, but I'm... Yeah, it's basically the same thing. Caitlyn, you're a hero. Thank you. Can I just say you're beautiful? I agree with that. You're a beauty. I've had a lot of surgeries to make this happen. Thank you. I'm attracted to you sexually. Okay, well, I have to go now, too. Sorry. Oh, no. I thought I was getting somewhere. Yeah, baby. Well, I have to go... I have to go fuck a train, baby. So... Wow. So I'm gonna go, but... Woke Bastard... It's me, Woke Bastard. Yeah, keep it 100. I will do that. Oh, hey, guys. I'm back from the rape convention. Oh, it's Nick Mullen. And Woke Bastard is also leaving. I've got to go now, even though... Because I'll hate... Because I'll hate Nick Mullen. Fuck, I lost the accent. And a scene. Guys, that was actually from the play Hamilton. That was a play? You haven't seen the play Hamilton yet? There were no actors here. It was just us. It was a deleted scene from Hamilton. That was all black people doing that. It's gonna rhyme. That's a rough draft. Hamilton rough draft. You know, give it a couple more weeks, and, you know, that... Lynn, what's his face? It's really gonna happen. May you all, baby. Lynn Manuel Samantha. Let's go. It's gonna hammer out the kinks and that. Have any of you seen Hamilton? No. No. I saw the performance. I guess I should also just say, it's good to be back, guys. Yeah, how was the rape joke convention? It was pretty good. They tried to get me fired. Somebody sent an email to the rape joke convention. Was it old Sadie? Yeah, it was Sadie and then a bunch of other, you know, just like angry people online. They said that they sent him an email and said, like, this guy does rape jokes. He thinks it's like funny to choke women. Wow. That's actually a direct quote for me. I said that. I don't remember saying it, but apparently I said that. You said that it's funny to choke women. You know, I didn't think I did, but a journalist tweeted that I said that, so I guess it must be true. That's probably true. Top three, banana peel on the ground, choking a woman, and hitting the balls, obviously. And then the trifecta, where a woman slips on a banana peel and her vagina falls into a guy's crotch. And so he has the pain of being hit in the balls, but he's also raping a woman. That is the funniest thing. They did a study that's historically the funniest joke that translates across all countries. Actually, that joke was written by the Japanese in World War II. They killed a ton of GIs from laughter. Well, that move is actually how the Russians won the 1980 Olympics, the gold Olympics. They coordinated it. Ms. Svetlana Sharanka, she put out the banana peel and everyone's like, what is she doing? This is going to be fucking ridiculous. And then, yeah, she pulled it off with her partner, Igor Sakizov. Igor Sakizov. Igor Sakizov with a V at the end. With a V. It's pronounced off, but it's a... So cute. That's what I said. My name is Igor Sakizov. Igor is here. I'm here now. They skyped me into the... The audio fidelity in my headphones is just perfect. Oh, no, Igor's got to go. Oh, goodbye, everyone. Pretty soon the characters are just going to be one second, like just the name and then... Oh, good-bye, everybody. I'm going to talk to you. See you later. Who was that guy? That was the Australian re-talk. Hold on, I've got to go. I've got the trans-hatter. Hello, I'm the trans-hatter. You're not allowed to call me ugly anymore. Legally, you have to say I'm beautiful. Man, you're only allowed to do impressions of Caitlyn. What's that? It's mean because she's rich. That's the only trans-hatter. It's Caitlyn, bitch. Here I am, bitch. Here I am, bitch. Here we are, the real transwives of Target bathrooms. That's the reality show. We're all here in the bathroom for a big birthday bitch celebration. We're cutting Miranda's balls off. There's like a family coming in. They're like, get out of here. We're having mimosas. Target has to sponsor it. Oh, boy. Yeah, the rape joke convention was great. They sent all those emails trying to get me fired, and I was just going to go attend, and then they let me be the keynote speaker. Oh, that's awesome. So I gave a shout out to ComeTown, and I've noticed there were an additional 80 million downloads last week. Yeah, we're making a lot of money off of ComeTown. Yeah, we've got the Patreon. I used to call it Petrayon. Like General Petrayon. That's how I thought you pronounced it, and then somebody laughed at me, and I was like, yeah, you know, that's not a word. They made up that fucking word for this. Petrayon. Yeah, Patreon, Patreon. Like a patron. Like a patron, right, but they couldn't call it patron because somebody already owned that. So has anyone sent us money for whatever this podcast is? Yeah, every episode we're making about $7,000, $7 million. That's not bad. Can we grow from there? We should tell the listener at home what we're going to do with the money. Well, it goes to my crippling Ferrari addiction. And Adidas addiction, too. Addicted to Ferraris. Yeah. And melt them down. For real, though? We will buy Custom ComeTown. Attracts you. Attracts you. Man, 100%. Oh, my God. If you give us money, we will. Yeah, Adidas wouldn't make them because they have refused to acknowledge my presence on the internet. Damn. So I tweeted them or send threatening emails to their customer service department. We could get that shit and just sew on like a ComeTown patch on the back or something. That's what we should do. And then we should sew those at 800 or 9,000% markup or whatever. Of course. I'm down. Why don't we get fake bootleg shit and make that. Now we're talking. Yeah. Why don't we get Koogee tracksuits. Okay. And then put the ComeTown logo on them. I'm done. We'll talk about this more. No. What's that? Koogee is like a majority shareholder, Koogee, and private prison industry. That makes sense. No, I just made it up. What if he ends up in his own prison and then he's the hero of the prison? Do you think anyway, people are like, I hope Cosby goes to jail. It's like he would be the king there. There's no way that they would have everyone in prison would love Bill Cosby. That would be the greatest time of his life would end beautifully. People would be bringing them cigarettes and Doritos from commissary or whatever. That would be great. Hey Bill, how's it going? You're the reason I almost didn't end up in here. Well, if you just stop with the cuss words. Oh my God, Bill Cosby's here, everybody. I was at a restaurant with my wife. Restaurant? And she said, if you just stop with the cuss words and the rapids and the women and the loam. I had to go. Yeah. I mean Cosby. Okay. It's me, everybody. The other Bill Cosby. That's better. Yeah. I'm more at the Cosby than you remember. Growing up is good. Why are you doing it impression of me? Right now. I'm not doing it. All right. Professor Dr. Emeritus. I'm not fucking you. That's me, Bill Cosby. Oh, it's me. I'm retarded. I'm trimmed. We should just bring the French guy. Guys, guess how long this episode's been so far? Six minutes. 20 minutes. That's not bad. Oh boy. Oh boy. Can I talk to you guys about something that's been fucking me up? Sure. Okay. So I looked at the Forbes richest people in the world list, right? Number one. Easy. Bill Gates, right? He's number one. Bill Gates. No, it's Carlos Slim. No, Carlos Slim. Number four. He dropped down? According to the current Forbes list. Slim Carlos is the guy from the wire. Carlos Slim is the guy that invented Slim Jim. Slim Charles. Slim Charles. That's what you're not. You don't even know. Charles and Carlos are the same name. I happen to watch the wire on Univision translated. You watch it in Yiddish? Slim Carlos. I'm sorry that I watch it in Spanish so it could be, it seemed more real to me. I decided to change their ethnicity. Guys, this is a working theory of mine, but the star of the wire, do you know who that was? All the white characters. The city of Baltimore. The city of Baltimore. All the white characters. Funny here though. All the guys that season two of the wire, a.k.a. season one of the wire. Frank Sabatka season two was like, uh, like 31 years old. Yeah. But he played like a 55 year old. That's what happens, man. If you go bald. If you go bald, you're fucking 38 years old until you die. Except me. Like I'm no exception. But yeah, you guys are right. Wait, Forbes is dressed like an idiot. Forbes list. Yeah. I just cool you right there. You could play old man. Forbes list. Number one. Bill Gates. Number four. Carlos Slim. Number two. I thought Warren Buffett. Here's the trick, right? There's no number three. There is. So everyone's looking for number three and they can't find it. There's only four millionaires running around the school. All right. School. Well, that's where you do that prank. I don't know. The pigs. Warren Buffett three. Who's the number two richest guy in the world? According to Forbes right now. Uh, P. Diddy. You told the master P. I'm not going to answer. It's the guy who owns Zara. The store. What? The guy who owns Zara. What is that? He's like, I looked up his bio and basically the only thing he's ever done is owned Zara. Zara is like a shoe. He has 21. He has almost as much money as Bill Gates. He has more money than Warren Buffett. That's insane. What is that story? Just like old ladies. It's like a shit. It's like H&M. Oh, really? It's like, but it's owned by this guy. It makes absolutely no sense how like shitty pants. Yeah. He has almost as much money as Bill Gates. Like Bill Gates brought the personal computer to people's homes. The most like important invention. That was Al Gore, dude. Okay. Al Gore invented computers in the internet. That's right. And getting sucked off outside. He was the first guy to ever get sucked off outside was Al Gore. I invented. I can't even get anywhere closer. I'll invent it. I can't stop. I can't stop thinking about how the fuck this is possible. How much money that makes. The Zara guy being the second richest. Well, did he have money? Maybe he had money from something else. It was probably real estate or something. He owns Hapsburg. He owns the textile. Have you seen that? That there's like a conspiracy theory. There's a meme that goes around. It's like one Jewish bank owns every bank. One Jewish family owns every bank. It's like a Rothschild. Oh, yeah. That's the protocols of the Elders of Zion. No, it's like five families. No. There's a thing going around saying that the Rothschild family owns every national bank. Every national bank in the entire world. Which they do. Which, you know, it's true. But like, why would you, you know, remind people of that? Do you know what my reggae band is called? No, this is going to get it. The protocols of the Elders of Zion. These guys sound cool. It's all Jewish. They smoke weed. It's all Jewish banking people in my reggae band. Zion the lion. Zion. Anyway, yeah. But like, the reason I was looking at the Forbes list is because I wanted to know if Donald Trump was even the richest guy named Donald in the world. No shot. There's three other Donalds richer than him. I don't know. But they're fucking, they got so much money. Well, you would have to. If your name's Donald, you have to be a millionaire. There isn't an Adam in the top 1,000 richest people in the world. Good fuck that shit. Yeah. But they're like 20 Donalds. Well, maybe if your fucking name was Donald or Carlos Slim or some... Carlos Slim's a tight name. There's a Russian oligarch that I saw on the list. There's a Russian guy who is an insane amount of money. Egor Sakhinsov. Egor Sakhinsov. No, his first name... He capitalized off that gold medal fame. His first name is literally God. Really? Yeah, yeah. It's like God Sarnayev or something. Sarnayev. Yo, can we talk about how that Sarnayev guy, not guilty, y'all got to fill me though? What happened? The joker Sarnayev. He got not guilty? No, I just don't think he's guilty. Oh, I thought you meant they had a trial and he was... Somehow I missed that. Yeah. But he is not guilty. It's too beautiful. No. First of all, you can't be a stoner and be a terrorist. It's not possible. I'm going into a Tom Myers right now. Are you working out bids? What the fuck are you talking about? Let me ask you this. Did Jihar have a bong hit transplant? I mean, you'll be... Listen, you're telling me he's going to hit the bong and then get up and do plans? I don't think so. Can you tell me my man's going to take a toke? Yeah, on his way to the blueprints, he's going to see a bag of Cheetos and that's it, my friends. The most good. Yeah, Tom Myers. I think someone that's never smoked weed talking with authority about weed is the funniest thing in the entire world. So like bragging about it. The funniest thing Tom Myers ever did. Back to Tommy. Yeah. Fuck, I was going to do some research about chokes. That's going to be next... Oh yeah, we'll do that later. But the funniest thing Tom Myers ever did is when he did that CD taping. Yes, I love it. He was doing a bit and I forget what the bit was, but he sort of just casually mentioned it while he was on stage that his parents already have a grave for him. Next to them too. Next to them. They've already decided this motherfucker is going to have a family. Do you know I bought that CD online just so I could hear Stoff laughing? You're exaggerating laughing. I think it's only a computer camera. I'm surprised he's listening to it soon. Fucked up because Mike Turpin the whole time was like stomping his foot down on the guy. He's like, haha, look, doing this exaggerated laughing and Mike Turpin. Mike Turpin's a giant. He's like, he's like a power lifter. Power lifter MMA guy. Well, the guy squats like a thousand pounds, so he's like just smashing his massive foot against the ground, like fucking up the recording equipment. Tom had to ask his parents to bring him back to him. I'm like, listen guys, when Bernie drops out, we will be one step closer to Tom Myers eating that pussy. That's the only reason I'm writing that in on the ballot. Tom Myers has to eat the pussy. I'm voting Hillary only if Tom Myers eats the pussy. We should definitely make people aware of that. We should get a clip and throw that in the shit. Yeah. Oh, definitely. That'll be the break. It's going to be the Tom Myers that trailer clip. Since Tom Myers stuff. Fuck. What was I going to say? I had another Tom Myers story. You were talking about the graves. He's also an announcer at a children's baseball field. But what was the best part about that CD taping is Tom actually has fans. And I heard these like two weird guys from Newcastle, Delaware. What? Yeah, these two weird guys. Are you fucking kidding? Yes, I'm serious. These two like this guy whose proportions were all fucked up. He was like, you know, just fat and wide a Reddit guy with a weird like witch hat. I remember that guy. Yeah. And the long hair. And he came all the way from Newcastle. I guess that's not that far away from Delaware. Still. Yeah. I mean anything longer than one block. The fact that Tom Myers has a fan. Yeah, but it's like that makes sense that that's who would be. Oh yeah. Yeah. Like just the most off brand Reddit guys. Like not even cool in the Reddit world. Yeah. Would he? Like he's intimidated by guys that wear Bazinga shirts. He's like, oh, they're looking at me. I hope they asked me to sit with them. Holy shit. Imagine being on the low end of that totem pole, dude. Oh my God. Oh, remember that Mexican Reddit guy we saw at the pool hall? Yeah. He was wearing a fedora and a Bazinga shirt. We were shooting pool like a year ago and there was this fucking guy. It was like a Mexican guy with another Mexican guy and he's wearing a Bazinga shirt and he's got a fedora on. They're speaking Spanish to each other. And I think he was vaping. There was another element. Yeah. There was a third element. Spenders or vaping or something. Yeah. There was a third Reddit and stuff. It's like, this is just like a Mexican Reddit guy and he's just speaking Spanish. There's a whole thing. He's awesome, dude. This is like cancer. And the guy with him was just like in a, like just Mexico soccer t-shirt. Like it was just, he was clearly just, I don't know. It was incredible. Yeah. He got bullied out of Mexico. That's why he came here. He made fun of so hard in Mexico. He had to come across the border. I was just remembering the other day. I saw, I miss, I miss watching black teens harass people. The best. I was on a bus when I was like 17 and there was these three black teenagers harassing this middle-aged black woman who was like kind of overweight. And they were just making fun of her feet. And so they're like, ah, bitch, your feet look like Trek 3. Just a woman that wasn't talking to her. It wasn't talking to her. Like bitch, your feet look like Trek 3. Your toes look like fucking rotten grapes. And she's sitting there and just like, you know, stoically looking ahead trying to ignore them and there's like tears streaming down her face. Like Denzel and Lori. Oh my God. And that was like a classic moment of bullying. That is some fucking very good shit. I saw, I heard this, this one lady bullying another lady on the streets yesterday. She's like, where'd you get that dress? Century 22? It doesn't even make any sense. Well, it's not century 21. It's a knockoff. It's, well, 22 is better. It's from the future. That's true. Why like that century 21 is like the place it's not forever 21. It's close to forever, but it's a shorter amount of time. Century sounds like a long time, but it's certainly not forever. And that's the bit, folks. That's pretty good. Why don't you bring that one to me? That's a process. You know what? I think terrorists could never be potted. I think so too. Should we do a break? I think so too. Let's do a break. No, we hit, we hit 30 minutes. So first half is a success. And then yeah, I got to get more coffee. We'll be back in a minute, folks. Enjoy the Tom Myers bit. I'm Don Shipley, that Thony Navy seal the week I am. Geez, have I been getting beaten up with emails about some pictures, some chief posed with Hillary Clinton at one of her rallies or some stuff. Out of all the phony seals that I've ever busted, I have never been wrong because I check, double check and triple check, double check, double check and triple check and triple check. And I make it my business to know awards, uniforms, buds, databases, classified shit, claims, seal, buds, databases, classified shit, seal, claims, uniforms, all of it. And some of you guys went nuts when I started getting off of YouTube and starting my own video website. And the reason I did it, putting Stolen Valor on the map, new laws enacted that guys can't get away with this stuff, posed with Hillary Clinton at one of her rallies or some stuff. So it's an election year. It's an election year. You guys all excited about this election coming up? Yes! Actually, yes! Me, me, I'm an Obama person, but me, I kind of, part of me kind of wants Hillary Clinton to take the Oval Office. No, no, no, okay, okay, hear me out, hear me out. What's the first thing Hillary Clinton's going to do when she gets in office? Get back, get back, no! Get back at Bill for all the shit he pulled. That's why I'm going to apply to be an intern. I quit smoking though, so I don't know if that'll affect my shot, but... Good morning, Vietnam! Oh, I killed myself, because I have Parkinson's! Welcome back, everybody. Wow, Robin Williams was in studio for a second. The ghost. The characters, the characters app continues. The characters will not stop coming today, guys. Nobody stops coming, baby, this is Comtown. Sploosh, sploosh, sploosh. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'd smoke so much weed.com.thc, and I'll smoke more cum. I'm so stoned, man. Alright, guys, we got to talk about something for a second. What's wrong, Nicky Boy? So, I mean, I don't want to confront you guys or make it seem like it's your responsibility or anything. What? Okay, well, a couple of times I've stepped out of the room, and while I've been gone, you've led other people on the show, which I'm fine with. What are we supposed to do, man? It's supposed to be an open room, I get that. There's always an open door, everyone knows that. Well, there's one guy in particular. Apparently, there's this Seth Dickfield guy that comes on the show, which I have no problem with, but I found out that, apparently, that's supposed to be like a cruel impression of this guy that blocked me on Facebook a while back. He blocked me this week on Twitter? A friend of yours? Well, no. I mean, he'll talk to me as if we're friends whenever he has a complaint or something that he wants from me, but for the most part, no, we're not friends, and I'm a slimebag, according to him. It's kind of like an issue, so we shouldn't really be addressing him on the show. Now, I don't buy it. I think he's blowing this out of proportion. I really don't see the similarities. They're both named Seth, sure. They kind of have the same opinions, but this Seth has round glasses and Seth Dickfield, from what I know, has square glasses. Square glasses. That's a big, that's a key thing about the Seth Dickfield. Yeah, you wouldn't fuck that up. If you're going to do an impression of somebody, you'd at least get the glasses right. Right, right, right. Especially on a podcast. Yeah, so I mean, guys, at most, maybe like six or seven more times, you can let him come on. Okay, okay. But any more than that, you know, I mean, I really don't want to teach you. Okay, it's really upsetting this guy that is also named Seth. Yeah, he's also named Seth, I guess. That's really, if anyone named Adam is like a fucking mean character, like I'm going to get offended by that, that's like bullshitting. So what do you say? We don't need to give in to that. What you need to understand is that this other guy, Seth, did something happen? Well, he has PTSD. Oh, no. Which, you know, I mean, he wasn't like a veteran or anything, but apparently like growing up, people would make fun of him sometimes, which, you know, nobody experiences that. That's not a thing that anyone else has to deal with. It's really just him. So it gave him PTSD. He's basically a... Post-traumatic... Wait, this guy coming on? Post being teased by Seth Dakefield. Post-traumatic Seth Dakefield. PTSD. It stands for podcast triggering Seth Dakefield. It's a different type of PTSD. Geez. We're upsetting a lot of people, I think. Well, maybe... The thing about this podcast is that, like, I don't know if people like this or not, but it's kind of been a platform for us to just make fun of people we know. Yeah. Not like necessarily even famous people or, you know, well-known people. Well, it's... Maybe though he... Punching laterally, guys. I don't believe in punching up or down. He punched him left. He punched to the front. And to the right. That's what Ali did, and that's, you know... Ali, who was the greatest. Yeah, was the greatest. Seth actually, you know, said last week, if you're not hip to Muhammad Ali, it's not too late. Wait, on Facebook? Yeah, yeah. Did you see that? If you're not hip to... Whoa, is he in the room? Well, maybe... How about this for a solution? We just have him on, and we'll hash it out. Well, I asked him. You know, he was blowing up my phone the other day, and he was like, What did you say about me? And I was like, I didn't say anything, dude. You've never come up once. Which is a... That voice sounded very different to the Seth Dickfield voice. Yeah, he's like a... You know, I mean, I don't really know Seth Dickfield, but he's like, Hey, everybody, how are you doing? Which is not... And the other Seth is like, Here I am. It's me, Seth. And basically... Those are two different... Night and day. Night and day, yeah. That's true. You know, similar accents, because they're from the same exact place, and they're the same age. So, you know, they would have had a similar, if not identical... Louisiana. They didn't know each other. You know, weirdly enough, I don't think they could... It'd be really interesting to get the two of them together. Round glasses and square glasses. They can't sit in a room together to talk sometime in the future. We should maybe see if we can't broke through that. I asked him, you know, because he was like, He was like, What did you say about me? And I said, I didn't say anything. And I mean, I don't know this Seth Dickfield guy. So, you know, I can't answer for what another man says. You know, I have integrity. Absolutely. And I'm not going to put words in somebody else's mouth. You know, that's messed up to be. That's totally fucked up. You know, to go around just like, almost doing an impression. Not caring at all. I wouldn't do something like that. We know that. And that's why we started our podcast together. Yeah, because we're friends. Because I care about my friends, and I appreciate my friends, and the diversity of opinions that my friends may or may not have. Regardless of whether they block me on Facebook, because I made fun of one female Ghostbusters person. Eight months ago. What was the best? He was writing, he was like, Oh, get a load of this. I'm in a coffee shop the other day. Of course he is. He just sits in coffee shops, working on projects that will never fucking go anywhere. It's a two hour movie. It's all puns. I guarantee you that's what he was writing. I'm in a coffee shop the other day, and I hear this guy, he's talking about, he's on the phone with his pal, and he like transcribes this guy's like, you know, for a minute conversation. For his Facebook. For his Facebook. About how, oh, this is back before he was a Bernie guy. You know, oh, this guy's complaining, because he's saying, oh, it's sexist if you complain about Hillary Clinton. News for your pal, it probably is, and you know, that kind of shit, and he's like, and then he doesn't even stop there. He's going on to say, it's like they have, they have to have a female Ghostbusters now. It's like, why do girls have to have everything? And then it closes the quotation, and his line at the end is, Look out ladies, there's a new MRA sheriff in town. Oh, God. And when you say MRA sheriff, the image that pops in my head, partially due to autism probably, is I remember in Mario Party 2, where you can get like, there's like Cowboy level, but it's the Cowboy Wario. That's what I think. MRA Sheriff is Cowboy Wario. That's got to be on the internet somewhere. What, picture Cowboy Wario? Yeah, unfortunately, I'm one of these podcasts. Half of your followers. Half of your followers, AVIs or whatever. So I guess, yeah, I guess I want to, you know, just bring that up and, you know, let you guys know that, you know, maybe prevent that from talking too much shit. Well, open invitation to this other set. Anytime you want to come on, hash it out, you don't really, you don't even have to unblock me on Facebook. I was following you because you followed me, really. Oh, he blocked you on Facebook? Or on Twitter. I haven't been blocked yet, but I'm sure after this podcast, probably. Yeah, well, if you want to sneak into his mentions, just replying to anything Tolly Qualey tweets, because Seth will defend his opinions against anyone that dare trolls Tolly. How dare you say that to Tolly? Tolly Qualey. Really hip hop. I love you, Tolly. Just, you know, I love it. You know what it's fucked up is he doesn't understand how funny he is. He's amazing. He's one of the funniest people in the fucking world, and he just doesn't get why he's funny. But it's just not on purpose. Yeah, no, it's ridiculous. He's funny, though. It's stand up, right? I wouldn't say that. Okay, well, I don't know. I saw him at an open mic once. He was very funny. That's all I can say. Yeah, you know, I mean, for some reason, he's been in comedy 16 years. Funny. Nick, you're not helping. He's very funny, and we'd love to talk with him because he's so funny and we want him to defend himself. You're pandering too much, dude. Okay, sorry. It's a delicate line. Oh, you almost have to neg him into it. You know, you got to treat him like a woman. But you're trying to fucking treat women. Yeah. Neg them. I think we're all in agreement there. Absolutely. So, and I guess from the Brandon Ward El Corner, who isn't a character, that's just Brandon's... Our friend who's been the most remarkably successful out of his life. And that's, you know why? It's because Brandon's a fucking retard and no offense to real retards. You know, I know there's like issues with the word, but, you know, Brandon's a fucking idiot, but he acknowledges that. Like any fucking comedian. Like, I know I'm an idiot and I'd say, dude, dumb shit all the time. And you have to have a sense of humor about it. Otherwise, like, why are you even doing this? Right. And that's why Brandon's successful. To score chicks. It's because all of his content is fucking dog shit. His whole like Snapchat, he's going to be a Snapchat fucking guy, that's his thing. No, don't say that. I mean, he's funny. He's funny. He's funny, but he's also like self-aware to an extent. Like I'll see people. Oh, yeah, yeah. He's doing like a crackhead teenager character. Yeah. But he did, he did try to troll me on Instagram. He cyber bullied you. Because I think, well, he told me that he thought it was funny when I did the, hey guys, Drake had a Pokemon and Big Sean, Big Sean come in and he don't have sex. I like that you make him Asian. I make him an Asian baby. Well, that's kind of what he is. Well, yeah, he is. He's half Asian. He's half Asian, half Air Force. He wrote on my, he wrote on my Instagram, my last Instagram post, your light count is embarrassing. It's wild. Which isn't even... He's getting cyber bullied by Brando Wardell. I really wanted to respond. I stole this picture from Black Twitter. Speaking of stealing shit from Black Twitter, did you see the Good Morning America thing? No. Oh, it was awesome. Oh, God. So yeah, Good Morning America, they, I mean, I feel so dumb doing topical stuff. Why? Just do it. Well, because it's, you know what this is going to be? I'm going to describe it and then I'm going to go, isn't that fucking stupid? And then we're going to go, yeah, that was stupid. Well, we're here, baby. Yeah. Good Morning America tweeted something like, which meme is the most meme fucking something? Right, right, right. And then they included... That boy? And it was like, is crying LeBron the next big meme? Yeah, that was it. Is crying LeBron the next big meme? Watch. But listen. Well, then is that the next crying Jordan? Lizard T. Hashtag Lizard T. T Lizard. T Lizard is the Kermit the Frog thing. Yeah, yeah. And then smockin' that mask thing, which I don't even know what that is. I haven't seen that one before. And then some other fucking thing. I don't know. And then somebody wrote... Somebody wrote... Ah, fuck was it. Good Morning America races or something about stealing the comedic excellence of Black Twitter by not acknowledging the Black Twitter roots of a picture of Kermit the Frog. I mean, come on. Like that's... Well, they invented rock and roll and they invented Kermit sipping Lipton's tea. That's none of my business though, you guys. If that's what cultural appropriation is at this point, then... I think it is. Just stealing a picture. Good Morning America tweeting a meme that Black Twitter invented. Also, the Good Morning America wreck... They got the memes wrong, right? No, they got them right. Tea lizard. It's actually more... It's cool that they said tea lizard. Tea lizard is Sobee. Do you remember that brand? It was like a lizard themed tea. I used to drink their energy drink all the time. Hell yeah, dude. I used to get crates. Not crates, but from Safeway. They had... Or like Shoppers Food Warehouse. They had the wholesale size of the Sobee adrenaline. Sobee adrenaline? That was like a loser? Yeah. That was good. That was a lizard, man. Yeah. I love soda. I want to go back to being a soda guy. I've been like really into... Did I mention it last time? The Kmart graphics tees? I don't know. Yeah. You are wearing a Bob Marley... I am. I'm wearing a Bob Marley shirt. Yeah, you said I dressed like an idiot earlier. You've been dressing solely in Kmart graphics tees for the last three weeks. That's the fucking move, dude. I want to find one of these like Schwick Norm Core parties. Or it's like, actually we just dressed normal. That's like the cool thing. And then you show up wearing like a... Like a... Like a Suicide Squad Joker Fitted Tee. Or Fitted Hat. It's like the newest... The Jokermovilia there is. The Jared Leto. Just a picture of Jared Leto. Yeah, Joker Fitted Hat. And see if you can get them to kick you out of the party for wearing Kmart clothes. Like, you're not cool in the right way. Who has Norm Core parties, though? I don't know. I might have just made it up. I don't think that's the thing. No, Adam, you have definitely gone to a party where everyone dresses that way. No way. 100%. Probably the one you were at yesterday. What were you telling me about? Oh, yeah. I went to this party and this girl was there and I didn't know who she was in it. Ended up being Lenny Kravitz's daughter. Jenny Kravitz? Jenny Kravitz, yeah. No, Zoe Kravitz. You're telling me you haven't gone to a party where everyone's wearing just, like, white tees and, like, ugly jeans? No, that's Baltimore, dude. No, dude. But I mean, like, the fit of shit. Baltimore, everyone... Okay, I don't want to piss people off. Let's do it. Everyone smells like trash in Baltimore. Oh, dude, I feel... And dresses like poor people from the 90s. Dude, how fucking did you... That's the Norm Core aesthetic. That is true. That is bizarre how that's a thing. Where they were like, 1998, this is perfect. But you're talking about art school kids in Baltimore. Yeah, yeah, yeah, like Micah kids. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's true. I mean, all those people are mad cool, too. But that's the aesthetic. Dude, not that cool. Guys, here's what I want to talk about. Not really. What are you backpailing for? Yeah, go ahead, Nick. Who's excited for the new Independence Day? Oh, I am. Did they get Will Smith? They didn't. Is that the dude Will Smith's son? Yeah, he's playing Will Smith's son. It's not Jaden, but it's a guy playing Will Smith's son. Will Smith actually picked Suicide Squad over Independence Day 2. What a fucking idiot. What an idiot. Are you offended? Yeah, I mean, I don't think Suicide Squad's gonna be good. I'm excited for Independence Day 2. You're excited for it? I'll see it, but I'm not excited for it. Well, the first one was so good. That's like the first time I've been earnestly, like, excited about a sequel or remake in a while. You think it'll be good? Yeah, of course it will. I think it'll be fun, it'll be fucking shit exploding and shit like that. Yeah, that's what I mean. The guy that plays Will Smith's son, though, sucks so hard. He's on the commercial. It's just like, today, Earth, he just gives, he's just like trying to be like fucking, he's trying to give a big speech and it sucks. Like the Bill Pullman one, for God. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Today is our Independence Day. And then the president, just like they let him fly a... Well, that's the thing, is that he's sick at flying. Yeah. He's a former pilot. What if that's what his campaign was? It's like, I don't know shit about anything, but I'm the best at fucking flying. And then people voted for him. I mean, Dwight Eisenhower didn't know he was a fucking general. He was a four star general, dude. Dude, that shit's easy. It was a hero. That shit's easy. I could do that shit. I think you couldn't. Easy, dude. Okay, well, that went nowhere. What's up? What else is... I think it looks gay. You think it looks gay? Yeah, I mean, yeah. It's a scale of one to ten gays. We should have a movie review segment. We're like, that's... Oh, the gay-o-meter. I mean, that's essentially what Rotten Tomatoes is. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Well, no, it's because... Create a widget. Fresh. Which changes fresh to gay. Yeah, no, Hank, the guy that... Hank Tomato, the guy that opened Rotten Tomatoes. Hank Tomatoes. Well, yeah, he was like a guy that fucks tomatoes. Oh. So it was like how he ranked movies. The better he liked a movie, the more tomatoes he fucked after watching it. It was 100. If he fucked 100 tomatoes, it was a really good movie. Yeah, no, that makes sense. We should have... I was actually looking at a review of The Sandlot, a Roger Ebert review of The Sandlot. You said he trashed it? No, I mean, it doesn't have like particularly good ratings. But Roger Ebert said he's like, you're just so like enveloped in the movie that at one point a line drives hit over, I don't know, the first basement and I found myself ducking in the theater and reaching up with my mitt. But I didn't have a mitt on. It's like, no, you didn't. Yeah. Absolutely did not happen. That's a lot. You're like completely lying. And if you did, then you need an MRI. You need like a fucking... You need to get your brain... Oh, yeah. It was like a 3D ride at Disneyland. Whoa! Yeah. Movie reviewer. Yeah. He watches movies professionally. All day long. If anyone is numb to that kind of shit, it's him. Who the fuck is he kidding? I thought the baseball was coming out in a movie screen. I'm glad he's dead. Yeah, me too, honestly. Did you see that first interview he did when like they got the... they did remove the second half of his face? The job. The bottom of his face. Oh, geez. Yeah, yeah. It was just using the... The Stephen Hawking machine. Well, he was using like the MacTalk app. Yeah, yeah. Like, hello, it's me. Roger Ebert. It was so great or whatever. And that video was great because you could just make him say whatever you wanted. Oh, yes. Mac and talk. Oh, wow. Fuck. Yeah. Have you done that? I did. I made a couple of them. When I was like 20. Let's make some more. Yeah, we should do that. Let's make some Come Town Originals. Come Town Originals of Roger Ebert. Well, how did he die? Did his cancer come back? The cancer, yeah. Didn't he get like a jaw transplant for him? That documentary was really beautiful. A hot sec. Yeah, and then it rejected. That sucked. Yeah, his body rejected it or something. He had a jaw again. There was like a day where he thought he was going to be okay. His wife's name is Chaz. That's pretty cool. Is it Chaz Bono? Yeah. It is. It's a sassy black lady named Chaz. She's sassy. Do you know who has a black wife? I love the pictures on like vacation of Chaz's kids and like just this fat white guy. They're such a happy family. It's like all these black people. It's just like portly white, like smiling. A lot of family reunion to Six Flags. Make custom t-shirts made. The Koopa E-Boot family reunion. They all have the shirts. Two thumbs up. I think he was a drunk. You know who has a black wife? Is George Lucas. Yep. Which is hilarious. You know his wife played George R.P. Well, that's what I'm saying. I was like, wasn't there a conversation at household at some point where she's like, George, what the fuck is this? No, it's chill because she's like, I told you not to read my scripts. She sectioned it. George is crazy. This is Jamaican hysteria type of alien. He was a platypus Jamaican. Yeah. Well, I mean, if you think about it, that's the only like racist against blacks character in Star Wars because pretty much every other, the majority of them are Asian people. Yeah. He found a way to like every single one. The glasses lady in the last one was amazing. That's a tribute to George Lucas. That's the only hat tip to George Lucas. The glasses lady was like, one day your destiny gon' be real big. You gon' have real good time destiny. You are, you like Rook Skywalker. It's like, there's like a shooting star in the background. It's like, this is for you, George. J. James like points outside the stadium. Yeah, real big. You get your own lightsaber. You go down basement, find lightsaber. You be real hero, just like Rook Skywalker. Oh, fuck yeah. Yeah. Now the best one though, the most racist of all the Star Wars like, you know, background characters has to be Han Solo's co-pilot in Return of the Jedi. Han Solo or? Oh, yeah, Lando. Lando. Yeah. He just looks like a fat Korean. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, then all he says is like, oh, okay, okay. George Lucas hates Asian people. I think we might be haunted by something here. Yeah, well, more so, because that's how, really, you can't just say somebody's racist, right? Because nobody has time to, you know, just say like, oh, this guy, then he has that defensive like, oh, I hate everybody equally, right? You know, he can just say, what's the word? Misanthrope, but he clearly hates Asians the most. So that's the one you should focus on. Yeah, beefing with an Asian actress. Who's that sexy Chinese lady who was in? Lucy Lu. No. Sandra Oh. That's to both of them. It was Bai Lin or something like that. Oh, yeah, yeah, from Crushing Tiger. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was feuding with her. Like with the wires. She got cut out of the movie or something like that. Oh, really? She was in it, she was like hunting fucking, I don't fucking know, Boba or something. I don't know, dude. I was beating off to her once and that came up in a search. Yeah. Do you see it made that ghost in the shell movie and like Scarlett Johansson, they cast Scarlett Johansson, all these idiots on Twitter are like, um, here's who you could have cast instead that's actually Asian. Bobby Lau. Lin Zhao. And it's like, who the fuck any of these people are? I know who Scarlett Johansson is. Maybe I'll go see this stupid fucking anime movie if she's in it. I don't know who. Oh, Ching Ching Sally. Ching Ching Sally. Yeah, she was on a TV show in Korea in 1992. So she should be the star of this blockbuster movie. Yeah, that one's going to get me in trouble. Yeah, we should just send that directly to your girl, Sadie. Yeah, Sadie should find out about that. You need to apologize to Sadie about being racist to Asian people. Well, you know, I feel like Sadie could come around, you know, she's with Doyle's Irish. She's got the evil inner, you know, she has the potential to be as racist as the rest of us. Listen, they came over on those boats and they saw those signs that said they need not apply. Yeah. And they thought they thought that meant to life. And so they just all became scumbag pieces of shit. But actually, there's another woman, Feminista Jones. That was fucking hilarious. Somebody started searching her old tweets. And like 2012, she's like, fuck Chinese people. Yeah, Asians can't drive. She's just straight up said Chinese people can't drive. Asians can't drive, which is like not even a joke. Is she like a Hillary person? Yeah, well, I don't actually know. Yeah, she's like a woke account though. This is such a weird group of people that Twitter has uncovered. Well, so yeah, so she had all the middle, the militant middle people. Well, hold on. So she goes, she had a tweet on there that was like, I love when you come out of a bathroom and you could tell the bitch that was in there before her pussy stank like a Holocaust shower, which is like, that's like my level. Yeah, that's the kind of shit that I tweet and I'm like, I don't know about this one. That's extremely online. Yeah. And so I kind of had this moment with her where it's like, I don't want to shame her for these old tweets. I just want her to be like, come back. Yeah. Let this be your like, come to Jesus moment. Just give up all this shit. Just be a monster online. Just fucking do it. You like it. It makes you probably makes you happy. You don't need to be a fucking good person. You need to enjoy your life and take care of your children. Let's reach out to her. Let's get her on. I tried to. She blocked me. I added her to one of my irony DMs. Isn't this like digging up? Isn't one of these like digging? Like this whole thing about digging up old tweets from accounts is like the same thing that we criticize. This happens to like SNL people, right? Yeah. You just do it to woke people online. SNL people aren't fucking sanctimonious pieces of shit. That's true. I support doing it to the woke. Yeah. If you're online constantly talking about like, you know, fucking going through and criticizing like word choices that people you presumably agree with, like her tweets on that day were all about some Asian guy that wasn't a good enough ally. I said something about how like Asian men's like, uh, allyship should be, you know, you should side-eye, clap back, fucking kermit the frog at it or whatever because, uh, because you know, uh, it erases her and then, you know, then immediately people were finding those Asian tweets and she's like, whoops, whoopsie daisy. She's like, I'm glad I've grown a lot. Yeah. But those are the people retweeting the stories about when a comedian gets fucking hired and you know, which is fucking ridiculous. We'll stay out of that shit. Yeah. No, they did it to Red Nitsky or whatever, who bumped me at the stand last night and crushed. Really? Yeah. How's his stand-up? Is he good? He's good. I want to hate him. I want him to like not. Did he dance? Yeah. He's like 23 or some shit. That dance thing he did on SNL was amazing. I didn't see the dancing. Yeah. That's really good. It's clearly what he auditioned with. Yeah. It was pretty incredible. Is it just dancing? No. Is it Hamilton? Yeah. Yeah. He was in a dance. And he's just... Well, how hard is that? It's a dancing movie. He's an electric performer. Yeah. Yeah. He's not a bad stand-up. You thought it was bad? It was fine. I don't know. I thought it was like... She's a bit... Yeah. I prefer jokes. That's the thing is like they always bring new guys on who aren't getting enough time to just do their stand-up during weekend update. Right, right, right. Yeah. So like that's... They did one of those things with him. Yeah, yeah. You know what, guys? We should make our own SNL with all our crazy characters that we've been coming up with. Yeah. Yeah. I mean... Like Dr. Evil and... Dr. Evil and woke bastard. And Seth Dickfield and... That'd be good. That'd be good. I think we'll see if we could do like a web series. That might work. That would be funny. You know, it makes me horny, baby. I'll see that lowest from Family Guy, baby. That would be good to see. You know what? What's funny to me is because like, I mean, I'm not like a free speech guy per se, but I do like copyright infringement a lot. Oh, it's the best. I think you should be able to just fucking steal shit from comics. We should do that. For sure. You can't own ideas, people. My angle is it's not funny unless you get sued. Nice, dude. I know that Once Come Town gets to a certain point, we're going to be getting like a briefcase offer, and they're going to be like the only thing... He's going to try and buy it. The only thing that needs to happen is you need to change your name. And Nick is going to be like, guys, let's walk away. Yeah. Oh, yeah. We're not changing the name. First of all, no one is going to fucking give us like $100,000 to be come down. It's going to be in a briefcase. Yeah. I'll do it. We want to make this. We want to make this a year. I'll get it. I'll get $100,000 for this podcast. NBC. I guarantee you, dude. No, you won't, bitch. Yeah, I will. MTV. C-M Town. I don't know if it's smart to shit on like a fucking MTV show. Don't do it. All right. Well, never mind. Do you want to work for them? No, not really. It's not going to happen, but... They're garbage. I was talking with somebody the other night, and... They're great. We were making fun of, like, you know, we've made fun of... We've made fun of, like, MTV shows in the past. Sure. And somebody told me they were auditioning. I'm not going to... I'm not going to fucking say it. I'm not going to say it. What? I'll tell you afterwards. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have even told you. Well, great for the podcast. I did. What was the story? You want to just cut that out? No, I'm leaving it in. He doesn't... Do you refuse to ever edit any of these ever? No, I don't. I just learned what compression is the other day. You can edit fairly easily, I feel. I could, but whatever. Why don't you just drop it? We can move on to something else. That's a good point. I like that. I wanted to mention this. Here's a good... You throw this in the bit tank for the open mic. Let's do it. So, the money in the briefcase thing... Nobody has briefcases anymore. No. But they still do the briefcase thing in movies. Yeah. They still do buying drugs. If I saw somebody with a briefcase today... That's for drugs. I would pull them over. Did you see that truck that got pulled over in the Holland Tunnel today? No. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. With all the guns? With the guns? But then they showed the truck, and it's like this fucking, like, Ramvan with wrap-around decals and a fucking, like, surge-green cooler in the front on, like, a bracket. They were, like, strapped up, and they were like, we had to rescue our friend who's addicted to heroin. That's what they said. And they had just, like, an arsenal of weapons. Trying to get into New York City. Yeah, the truck looks like a, like, a mid-90s Mountain Dew promotion. That's awesome. It's got all this, like, you know, like, urban tactical gear or whatever, decals on the side, like a Tonka decal. Oh, hell yeah. And yeah, there's, like, a fucking beer cooler attached to the front of, like, a neon green beer cooler attached to the front of the truck. It's basically a monster truck. Damn, I wonder what they were, for real, about to get into. Hopefully, about to, like, kill somebody over Mountain Dew. That would be the raid, the surge factor. I love that. You know what I love with each new mass shooting? It's always, like, a new, like, kind of, it's always a new, different type of guy now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So they're like, oh, yeah. Of course, it was a gay muslin. Yeah, closet and gay muslin. God, fuck. I don't even know who to be mad at with this one. It used to be easy. Just crazy white guy. Well, until, what's his name? The DC Cyber. No, I was, I almost said Jeremy Lin. That was the fucking Arthur, not Arthur. Virginia Tech. Virginia Tech. What's his name? Cho. Son Moon Cho. I don't know. I don't know. Whoever he is, he should star in the new Ghost in the Shell. That should be the fucking new. And we did it. And there it is. That's the callback. Folks, should that be the podcast? I think so. Whatever, we did it. That's an hour. You guys were fun. Yeah. You guys got anything you want to plug? No? Great. See you later. Nothing. Bye. Bye. Well, what do you think? How did you like that?

That's what America's history is. It's just like shit We don't want to do shit white people don't want to do they just made black people do so I'm sure black people fought in every war And we're back the same way. That's the same way. Well, they were actually wouldn't they wouldn't let them They would have to have like supply rolls and shit and be like hooks. Yeah, I mean, but they would make them do shit in every war Yeah, right Were they where they're black combat? Oh, yeah glory never mind. I was gonna ask the Civil War, but then obviously Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah by watching a brilliant move at Denzel Washington Matthew Broderick Well, you know what that doesn't show is that a lot of a lot of black people We're actually happy and fought for the south. It's kind of like yeah, yeah unfair, you know, yeah They really want it simpler life. They're trying to sign up And we're back on that Dinesh de Souza. He's doing a fucking a fucking Goddamn documentary about that shit that racist Indian guy, right? Is he about how the blacks wanted to fight? I don't know. It seems her in the Civil War Oh, no, here's a movie a CSA The Spike Lee we're about like if the South had won That's that's a cool idea. Well, I remember seeing the fucking trailers for it and it didn't look cool because it was like Everything's the same except there's slaves And it's like, yeah, I don't I don't think everything else would be the fucking same. Well, there wouldn't be any peanut butter. We know that yeah I Whoa fuck that shit. I would love it if he made that movie and fucked up and he's like, oh, yes I guess white people invented rap music It's just utopia Just flying cars, right? I mean technology would probably be further along Yeah, you have more opportunity to exploit labor. Yeah, I mean think about it. I think like incorporate I mean, I guess isn't there arguments that like the industrial revolution kind of did away with a need for slavery anyways There is that argument. Yeah. Yeah, but I mean it attack needs it for like the precision manufacturing Imagine if you could have slaves making the iPhones you that was all do right keep the jobs in America We could all save like probably like 20 bucks a pop Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, you know how many sign-up Keep them in cotton, but you get slaves really into screen printing and then you get on-demand custom t-shirts whenever you want Literally any idea you think I have a big plantation and you you know, you get up the t-shirt So it's vertical. I want a shirt and it's got Tony Danza and it says who's the boss on it I have a specific idea of how about sure and I told me closer Mm-hmm Danza. Oh, I like that.

They're not making any money That's how you do it. They get they get all the well, I think that this is a very decent Concept, but we should actually try to pitch it to the new Attorney general Jefferson Beauregard Beauregard sessions. Yeah, PG. Did he get the confirmation happening today, right? I thought I saw there was a tweet that people were making fun of today that said Say calling him Jefferson Beauregard sessions is is exactly the same as calling him Barack Hussein. Oh my god It's a reference to like a contrarian general We're not making fun of him for having an ethnic name. It's so fucking retarded. I Hate dude. They're like listen. He's bad, but using his full name liberals are fucking pussy-ass Let's go after these pieces shit. They're never gonna win the argument against calling him Beauregard is that it's like Literally, we'll do nothing. Did you know learn nothing from the drum thing right? Because it's weak. You sound like a fucking retard exactly. That's the argument Beauregard check out this bumper sticker slogan I'm gonna run with for the next fucking four right. It's not some kind of idea of decorum. Yeah, Republicans give a fuck They're trying to take everyone's health care away Don't give a fuck about you Fuck man Beauregard, but hopefully that motherfucker doesn't get in. I don't fucking know he's he's actually like Satan incarnate It's you heard that you heard the KKK quote, right? No idea. That's my favorite.

It was like one of those everyone's going If we don't watch move shut the fuck up like that's what I mean It's I don't give a shit about the donald trump thing But even that so for some reason movies are so much fucking better as if as if the entertainment industry isn't equally responsible for raping people and exploiting them and protecting Predators roman innocent Pulaski roman innocent free free. You know what roman. Yeah free my gear free my holocaust survivor um, but you know Absolutely, what's going to happen? Well, you know, they love Hillary Clinton in the fucking horrible mode.

She is. She's like one of the best actors in the world. I wouldn't go that far. You don't think so. No She's incredible. You see bad, but I did you see doubt that she's she's dope dude. She always kills it I mean, I'm not gonna say I'm not saying she's a bad actress, but one of the most incredible actors I think she's one of the best actors in Hollywood. Yeah, first of all I don't like that you're calling her an actor and not an actress. Oh, I don't I don't like the underlying politics here All right, fine. She's one of the best stewardesses in Hollywood. She's a nurse. The term is nurse Female anything is called a nurse Uh, yeah, but like, uh, you know, obviously that's lame of shit The you know the the movie that won apparently is this movie la la land. Yeah, it's a musical It seems horrible. Which is one of the says it's good. They make these movies. Did moonlight win anything? Yeah, I guess I don't want to see that, but I'm worried it's gonna be like I'm not gonna turn you gay No, it's not gonna turn me gay, but that I won't get anything out of it. It's really I was saying I kind of want to shoot a movie that's just two hours of like it Like an interracial trans couple literally just fucking but you you know shoot it with like Well, I like DSLRs or whatever. Yeah. Yeah, make it look a lot of time on like yeah, like color correction and shit And uh, maybe there's like some subplot about them getting fired from a coffee shop But they live in bushwick. They're trans they fuck each other and then just make make sure it's just pornography And see if you can win any war I would like to do a movie where there's just moonlight is nothing like that moonlight's incredible Actually, I went into it not knowing what it was at all and it made it way better like Uh, I didn't I tried there was some movie. I tried to watch it. It was like Like white girls or something. It wasn't white girls. I forget what the fucking was Yeah, but it's like yeah, just white chicks with the Wayans brothers. No, that's an excellent film I do think that movie that came out this movie that came out like uh this year where it's like It's white girls in the title something like that. Yeah, they just do drugs and it's nc 17 Yeah, they just do drugs and there's like a latino boyfriend And it's like i'm not annoyed with like the representation But it's like this is such a boring fucking movie. It's young people sitting around doing fucking drug that doesn't impress me I'm not like oh, oh, wow Yeah, they had sex. Yeah Hey, I don't know. I don't know that sounds pretty cool to me. Yeah, I watched it. I watched the mtv network There's got to be a spy. There's got to be a bridge, you know the spies meet on That's what that's that's the recipe for a good movie. Yeah, you need a bridge in there a spy Maybe some disguises. Maybe a guy that's a master of disguises You know, oh, maybe maybe you've seen that movie. Yeah. Have you seen that movie? In theaters incredible. That is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. It is it is so fucking bad You know, you know, my man thought he was purged like poised for a comeback, right? You know, it'd be a good sequel is his master of races Starring Dana carpet And he's an arian But he can play any race. He can play any race release a special. Yeah, he has straight white male age 60 There's no way it's good. Yeah, I saw the title And I'm like, you know, this is got to be the most tone deaf. Absolutely. There's no way I mean like I'm I'm like not even 30 and it's like I already feel out of touch, right, right, right? You know, I don't think that I could say anything that's like really culturally relevant or Get my finger on the pulse of of what people are thinking. No way But you know, that's probably exactly what happened He just came up with a new hour and it probably was not that good or not that like in touch And he was like, well, I'm gonna lean into it and just call it straight So it looks like I'm aware that this is bad. Dude. Did you hear that story about fucking, uh, uh, What's his name? Uh, there's the ticket. What's what's his name? The actor John Lovitz. John Lovitz. My parents just saw Dana Carvey and John Lovitz this week. John Lovitz at fucking, uh, draft house Yeah, something when, uh, I think it was Milner's closer. Well, then Milner was Milner was saying he was like, yeah, we had to Uh, uh, he had to have a cop hold around to the back of the venue to take him out because he was worried people were going to beat him up He was like saying that because he's a republican No, because he was on stage and he's like, what what the fuck are trannies back when I was young? It was just called being a fact Did I tell you to John Lovitz was saying this? People were like booing him. Yeah He's closer for a long time about the n-word, which is just a little bit by the way But he's like when you say the n-word everyone's thinking the words. All right, you're just saying the word Yeah, I know the Louis Vuitton. That's the Louis Vuitton. He's got he's closer for a long time was just a song And it was like it was just like Bob my friend Bob Saget is gay is a faggot It was like that's like that was the big musical number He told yeah, my my folks saw saw him and Dana Carvey this weekend and my dad called me to To tell me the bit and I was like, I don't really think that's that funny Well, Norm I love anytime norm talks about him on a podcast about doing comedy just shits on him because it's like Lovitz was never a stand-up He's just like a guy who's like famous now and he's a comedian actually Yeah, like like I want that dude I want to I want to just I want fame and then just to go around just being terrible at comedy I know yeah, it's the same thing I do now David Alan Greer, but with a lot more money I bet you David Alan Greer is at least interesting to watch I I I saw him at draft house Stevo and and uh, what's his name? Mankind? Tom green is a holy mick foley Yeah, it's Tom green a good stand-up. No, I don't know, but I don't know It's weird. He's good. I mean he's he's a funny. It's weird that like people comedy is so hot right now Mike diesel uh one time that uh, Mike diesel Yeah, explain him on the podcast before this guy that booked a fucking Open mic. Oh, yeah, the only sure he booked. Yeah, he booked booked uh uh, wise acres in northern virginia, but he was like a pathological liar or whatever and uh So he would anytime any comic was brought up. He'd be like, yeah, we're gonna actually uh, we're gonna have him through the club You know, and it's like We see the headshots on the wall. We know who fucking comes through here. It's the drum comic the coach and then like Remember the magic 45 fat guys at all had their like fucking aorta explode at age 37 and they you know From coke and sandwiches. Yeah pretty much. Yeah from free comedy club bar food from from fried pickles and king kong nachos And all all that shit. Yeah case ideas with fried chicken in the chili burger Yeah But uh, yeah, so but one time comics. We're just talking about emerald agassi and this is like 10 years ago So it was when like emerald emerald show was real big or whatever. He was huge. Yeah, and bam was a big joke everywhere Yeah, yeah, yeah, so like two comics we're talking about emerald I think it was Andy Klein and somebody else and fucking diesel comes up and he's like, uh Yeah, we're actually gonna have him through the club Because he thought they were just talking about a comic so he decided to just lie about it They were like to do what and he's like, you know Oh, yeah, I'm here Do what mike just cook on the stage. Dude the worst part is I could see Emerald would could get booked to headline a club so much better than a good comic. Yeah, no credits Like if emerald was like I want to do comedy. Oh, yeah, every club would headline That's the thing that sucks about stand-up is that like audiences are fucking retarded No, like the people they and I don't mean maybe in their personal lives They aren't but something happens to people when they enter a comedy club that they just become abject fucking retard They get drunk. They want something to just go fucking do but it's also shocking how many people Don't even like comedy in their personality go to comedy clubs. Yeah, all they want is to be shit on all they want Is hack shit how fucking funny is it that like the thing that we've chosen to pursue Is on par with like let's just go bowling tonight Right, right, right, right, right that it would be like if you were really trying to be the best guy It's setting up the pins. Yeah. Yeah. It's not even being is not even bowling. It's working at a bowling alley It's working at a bowling out is is what being a comedian is Well, the other thing is but but I saw a guy I saw a guy crush in Detroit and I forget who he was I was trashed. I was really fucking drunk and I was there for a festival And there was a guy that just went on stage and as far as my memory goes He was the red shirt guy. He dressed in all red and he handed out red shirts and he just played music And it was like this isn't even calm. He's not even attempting comedy And people loved it Because it was just a guy handing out shirts. Jesus. It didn't say anything all free shirts. I don't think yeah I fuck with free shirts Yeah, no, it sucks comedy sucks it but well, how many people do you stand a bump into? Do they go to even good clubs and like this is my first comedy show and it's like what? How is this your first come but I guess there's no real comedy fans anymore because the people that are Were comedy fans are now just doing comedy. They do mics. They also edit, you know, I mean, that's not true, dude Podcasts people at work love listening to fuck yeah people love podcasts. That's not stand-up comedy I'm talking about some people it is some people. That's what comedy is. Yeah, but it's fucking not dude. I mean this is not This isn't edited or honed no show is I mean maybe there are show podcasts out there where they write all this stuff in advance You know, and that's not stand-up comedy. No same. Yeah. Yeah Yeah, well another thing is like going back to the love it's thing is like there are a ton of comedic actors Who do comedy shit and then try to go into stand-up that because stand-up is hot right now So it's not that it's so what they do is they work like the meltdown room in la they work like The kind of alti rooms where everyone knows them from, you know, children's hospital or whatever And then they they crush and then they get their 30 minutes Which sucks because they've been like because people give them laughs just because they were from the tv, right? And then they sell it to netflix and make a ton of money, you know You know that that that's become like a fucking business model for a ton of like comedic actors Who fucking suck who think that stand-up isn't a skill We're gonna make this podcast number one and then we're gonna produce the world's shittiest web series And we're gonna get jaded and then we're gonna sell this sell it and then we're gonna be, you know, terrible like everybody else I can't wait, dude. I would love to remember when what's his name cordry was hosting was hosting a bensin ball Jamel was on that show. I wasn't like that show dude. It was like insane. It was he was doing brodie brodie stevens did my show And he's good. Yeah, he's he's hilarious. Yeah, I'm not gonna get into the habit of shitting on people specifically Especially guys that I think are funny. Yeah. He's super funny, you know Adam Friedland said it right here right now. It's crazy. Rob cordry is a terrible comedian. No, I Both we all love we're both looking at you. Like, why would you fucking say that adam? Please? I was holding up a sign said adam. Please stop. I told the story about I told the story about how emerald agassi shouldn't do comedy Which is fair. I didn't say he was a bad cook I didn't come on the podcast and publicly announced and Rob cordry is a fucking bad. Well, let me go through my list right now bad Comments, okay? Um, we see K Louie CK Jerry Seinfeld You got your mcdonald norm mcdonald I haven't read his book. I have it. I have it. You can have it.

He's he's like a great novel I was going to do like a sky service like bookshelf with like four books on it And I always wanted to do like a sketch where it's like a girl bringing like a guy back to her apartment And there's like a bookshelf with like maybe seven books on it and he just looks at it and he's like Have you read all these books? It's just it's just the dictionary. Yeah, I wow that's amazing Wow Wow, wow, you read all these you read all these books. Wow. Wow. Maybe I will try and kill myself Who made him try to kill himself? I think he did it He just did no it was Andy dick got him on no, no, no, no, no, no, Andy Andy got fill harman's wife on coke. Yeah, really? Yeah, apparently. Yeah, that's why she cut it. Uh, she killed him That's why she killed him. So we should kill Andy dick. It's Andy dick's fault. Well, you do a fatwag against Andy dick No, we should get Andy dick's husband on cocaine So they um Have a fuck brain. Oh, no, no, Steve Cougan. Didn't people say Steve Cougan got uh owned wilson on smack And that's why he was about to kill himself. Yeah, he was like addicted to harrowing coogs. Yeah I love Steve Cougan. Cougan's great. Oh, man. I saw I saw an advertisement because Ricky Gervais stole his life Yeah, you're Ricky Gervais literally stole his so much better than we stole his world I saw I saw an advertisement for the aarp on like network television Where it's like, uh, you know, it's like a woman and she's like scrolling through the aarp website and her friend Who's a man is like, what are you doing on aarp? She's like, well, you qualify for yourself too. Mr. 50 You know, and he's like, I don't know about that You know, he's apprehensive about admitting that he's old enough to join the aarp But none of those people will ever be able to retire. Right. So and then she's like, yeah Well, check out all you're missing out on and then she's just like looking at pictures of Ted Nugent It's like one of the benefits of being in the aarp is that you get to see pictures you get Ted Nugent's flicker account Ted Nugent with cat scratch fever. Yeah Which is sexual and underage Polynesian woman. All right. Well, we're out of time Great. So I just want to say I love you Rob.

That was just one condition Yeah, I'm out with I'm out with the ants, which by the way is not a big deal I think ants gonna do the show. Did you talk to him? Yeah, I talked to him about it. He's fine I saw the clip from his podcast. He wasn't really that mad. Yeah. Well, because it's like again Uh, he was wrong about the fucking thing. I'm like, I feel like I'm entitled to just say yeah, he's fucking wrong about it Also, you notice no one put in the fucking part where we sucked him off and said he was the funniest dude Yeah, they edited out the fact that we were all huge fans. He's like shit head fucking, you know No, yeah, they literally tattletales. They're like, oh, that's a bitch move Time to bust out adobe audition. Yeah And make my little tattletale clip. Maybe it'll retweet me Exactly. Fucking losers. Right So yeah, it's just fucking guys that tattletale to mic francesca all day long The dog is a faggot mic So if you were if you were questioning strong opinions at the jets Yeah, no, there's no bad blood between come town and and ant Um, and if there was we would just fucking talk about it. It's like not I don't understand why people think that that would be like an issue to fucking well. We said there is this is the podcast You just heard adam say out loud. He hates rob. Yeah, the most powerful man in show business Probably like if you look at adam's career track, he's going to be a robcordery type And so he's going after, you know, the one guy that can help him. So we're yeah, we're not afraid to confront anybody Yeah, that's on the show And this is the show where again where adam says fuck rob cordy Fuck louis he can adam hates all these people and he doesn't give a shit about it Before the show, we were talking about how tigna taros fraud. I don't think she had cancer. Yeah, that's true And I think she's heterosexual I think she's trying to get that lgbt money And that cancer money. I want to get a tattoo that says lgbt, but that like every letter has the two stripe dollar sign Like a symbol through lgbt. Let's get big titties.

It's free. Yeah, because it's free. No, it's not. They're neither of them are free Oh, I thought xbox was free. No, no In fact, that that's the fact that it costs money makes it more racist because it means that minorities don't have access to it Oh, yeah, it's like a poll tax. Yeah Dude, I like honestly you go and play like you play there's so funny I remember like like 10 years ago whenever like you said like online games with like headsets and shit You would play a game for a while and then the price would drop and as soon as the price dropped You would like, you know, you'd be playing when it came out and it'd be like, yeah, uh, like we got to go over here Like capture this objective.

We gotta talk about it Uh, vampire weekend Oh, right. Well, he hasn't agreed to do the show. Well, he agreed to do the show fans vampire weekend. Uh, Ezra Klein from box.com Ezra Koenig Said that he wanted to do come town. So you whatever. Yeah. Oh, and he probably will never do it and ashton kutcher also In dany masters. What a fucking asshole name by the way. You hear it all the time So you stop thinking about it, but jesus that and mccauley colkin What a fucking shitty name. Yeah, ashton's worse than mccauley mccauley colkin is is like the best child actor. It's like kutcher is busier than colkin I think kutcher's a little i'll give you mccauley, but then kutcher is worse than how about this, uh, mccauley kutcher Oh That sounds like an ad agency it does.

Yeah, I just want to say to all those guys that black lives matter Yeah, and if you do black lives matter if you're uh, I love the racist. I don't point it out There was one guy that was like It was so funny He was like, oh these stores ever recovered dude. There was some girl that was raped and fed to alligators It's like yeah in florida dude. What the fuck are you talking about? Yeah, these dudes that are like so fucking paranoid about a genocide against white people One of them was like replying to nyx tweets and he's like, dude, they raped a girl and they fed her to guideers That's like one of his that's his evidence. The black lives matters is feeding girls to gators Definitely not bitch movies to live in fear about the knockout game. Yeah, that's the way to prove You're not a fucking coward is that that's the thing has been all your time worried about the fucking knockout game and being fed to alligators They're fucking snowflakes They're they're they're uh, you heard racist Adam will play you snowflakes. I mean snowflakes are white dude Dude, it's better for whatever Snowflakes are white. They're cold. You know, they're icy. They're beautiful. I don't understand what the problem is All right, what the fuck are we talking about? We've been ending this fucking episode for 20 minutes It's literally been two minutes. Really?

Let's build the community. I'm faggot Adam being gay. That's the thing, man We need we need unity in this country. And I think the ticket is specific anti-semitism Directed at actual individuals Not this sort of generic nebulous. There's no plot. It's divisive. You pick a Jew and you go after one It's me together. I'm the problem. You know how you know if if Hitler picked one Jew that he really didn't like Would people have thought he was such a bad guy? They would have given him that one guy It was the one guy you could have taken over the world and wouldn't have been a problem. That's true. Yeah He should have only killed one Jew. Well, uh Uh Sure, I don't think there's a way to fix any of what I just said. So No, no, we're fucked. Yeah. All right, you guys are fun. Thanks",

        "transcript_text": " We're starting this one off mid conversation. Will, Will, Big Dick Will Menager's back. Yeah. Big Thick Dick. Yeah. Wide. Wide Dick. That's the illiteration. It's the girl. Big Dick. Bill. It counts. Will she go rhyming or illiteration? Should it be Wide Dick Will or? It's Billy. It's Billy? Yeah. Big Thick Dick Bill. Alright. Well, Wide Dick Billy, dude. Why? We got into a conversation. I was telling Will, we were watching one of the holodeck episodes of Star Trek Next Generation last night. With my sexy ass little, that Greek, that Greek woman with the nice juicy cheeks. She's in every episode. Marmaritina Seartris? Yeah. Councilor Troy? Yeah. Yeah, dude. He was not familiar with Councilor Troy. No, I did. I missed a lot of that. She is, you know, she's the empath. Yeah. She gets to dress sexy and just be like a therapist for everyone. Yeah. That's what I love is her character was created to explain empathy to the fucking autistic morons. They're like, what do you mean caring about other people? They're like, well, she's an alien. They're like, oh, I guess that made a difference. She has an alien ability to discern people's moods and emotions based on... Right. They had to create an other world character to explain that. And she had to have juicy ass titties for them to pay attention to. Well, that's what she used to feel their emotions. Every Star Trek iteration has like the sexy woman. Sure. And they fucked up. I think we mentioned this on the show before, but when they did Voyager, they were like, we're not going to do that this time. We have a female captain. Torres is like kind of hot, but in like a spicy Latina way. Yeah. She's like the fucking hoop earring Klingon. She's half Klingon. She's half Klingon. That'd be like that's too much. Well, that's her name. I always thought she was more of a Torres. She's half Puerto Rican, half Klingon, which Jesus Christ. You know what? Honestly, I think that might be real. I think there's women like that in the Bronx that are legitimately half Klingon. Fucked up foreheads. Yeah. Yeah. Do you honor killings? Oh, I got a piece of warp drive. I don't have comfort ease. No, but then the ratings are down. So then they just invented out of a whole cloth. The sexy robot. Yeah. The sexy. Yeah. Jerry, right? Yeah. We've talked about her. She's so hot, which then she's insanely hot because she did so well for Voyager. They added her onto other shows on UPN. They had a great, right? During episode with Jerry Ryan on Sentinel. She was on Boston Public too. She was on Boston Public, but that was Fox. She was on the Wayne's Brothers show. Yeah. They would add Jerry Ryan to other shows. I'd like to digress you. The actress Jerry Ryan was married to a congressman. She was married to a Republican congressman from Illinois, I think. Who took her to sex clubs? Yes. Yes. They got divorced because he took her to like some sort of sex club in Paris and like made her do things uncomfortable with him. That sucks, Jerry. Jerry, if you're listening, I know you are. I'd never treat you that way. She's probably so fine right now. I loved you that the way they stereotyped the sexless Asian Ensign Kim into being like falling over his dick for the robot character in that show. Didn't you troll him on Twitter once? I did. Yeah. I got into a big argument with Garrett Wang, the guy that plays Ensign Kim. What? As I was explaining to him, I was like, well, you know, I was like, I asked him, I was like, is Space China different than regular China? And he was like, what do you mean? I'm like, in the Star Trek universe, Space China that Ensign Kim comes from. And he like, Dot added me and he's like, Ensign Kim is Korean. And I was like, he most certainly is not. I know for a fact that Ensign Kim is not a Korean character. Kim is a Korean name, but that's because the writers didn't give a shit. They just named the Chinese guy Kim. And he was like, Kim is a, you know, a Korean surname. And I was like, again, the character's not. And then I went through YouTube and I actually found a video of Garrett Wang at a Star Trek convention panel explaining that Ensign Kim is Chinese and that the writers gave him the wrong name. And I was like, yeah, well, here's your fucking name. He was like, what's your problem? But honestly, he's right. What is your problem? Who fucking who does all that research to troll Ensign Kim? Or whatever. I just happen to know that Garrett Wang, which by the way, Garrett Wang, hilarious name. Yeah, no, I used to ask him about Gates McFadden. And if she was like, okay, because her Twitter is pretty fucking crazy. She's a doll of herself as like Dr. Crusher. Crusher that she plays with. Crusher could get it too. She's fired. Well, the original hook for this was how Star Trek, the writers of basically every one of the Star Trek series like rung so much out of the holodeck. And then like at least every season, there would be one all holodeck episode that were always miserable. Yeah, just terrible. And they got this because they got lazy about writing space shit. So they were like, ah, fuck it. Let's just write Maltese Falcon. Yeah, the exit button got broken. It's gonna and you know what? It's lazy writing because all of the characters are these like God characters, where it doesn't matter how the story progresses, because they always know they can leave the holodeck. Right. So they present like, you know, the conceit of this one was that there's some, you know, like Jade Monkey or whatever that this mob boss needs. And Picard is like the private eye that has access to it. But they never have to address any part of that story. Because Picard's like, they think I have something they need. Isn't that funny? There was there was ones where they're laughing when the guy gets shot. Oh, yeah, which by the way, they go, we brought along our fiction officer. So that guy's just gonna be dead. You're never going to see him again. Well, there was one where data kept doing holodeck scenarios where he would play as like Sherlock Holmes or something. And again, this is sort of like a shout out to the show's fan base of like, you know, using games to teach you about literature. But like, it was like some conceit, the conceit of that episode is that like, again, they get stuck in the holodeck and they go through some sort of cosmic radiation and it makes the Moriarty character self aware and deadly and like actually kill you in the holodeck. Yeah. And again, just like, don't have a holodeck. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, the only time it was actually useful, I think was like an on Voyager with the to Valk Pond far episode where you like, you know, the Vulcans, they have to fuck, they can only fuck every seven years, but they have to fuck or they die. They just go fucking crazy. Like that's me. Yeah. So like seven year nut just builds up their brain. Their balls must be so heavy on like day a year six. Wait, was the black Vulcan Vulcans are. Yeah. Vulcans are no fap. You know, save it till mayor. They're autists. They're real mindset guys. Very logical breaking point of seven years because you can't, you know, be no fap that long. So, but in Voyager, the, the idea behind the show is that they get trapped in the Delta Quadrant. So they're so far away from anyone they've ever seen before. And so they hit the seven year mark and there's no one for two Valk to fuck. So they have to just let him fuck in the hall of death. And I love, I love, I always like, because, you know, I mean, it's a room that it's a hologram, right? And then they have enough ability to manipulate the physics of the hologram so that you can touch the texture and texture and stuff. But anything that's produced in the hologram isn't made out of whatever substrate material that the hologram creates. So if you're it, I'm all I'm saying is there's got to be just buckets of common. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The floors are caked. Yeah, like there's there's some like, you know, Starfleet ensign, like the Wil Wheaton character, like part of his duty would be actually just like mopping down. Yeah, like fucking Travis Bickle's cab. Well, we'll be such a perfect good boy on the show that he actually lives solely off calm. He's a 100% celestial being. He's a goody good boy. In touch with the universe. I like the idea that that there's some kind of video feed without the hologram. So you just see the guy fucking in space, like in air, you just see like his dick fucking bumping and there's no pussy around it. I want to see that shit. I want to see the feed, the uncut feed without the holograms. Yeah, just wearing a Sherlock Holmes outfit. Yeah, he's still in costume with his dick out. And I love too that the dumb shit that they're obsessed with in the the holodeck is always things that baby boomers like. Yeah, like the idea that in the year 2630 that somebody's Tom Parris on Voyager, he's always working on a Camaro 1970 Camaro. And then fucking sort of like the equivalent of nowadays, like hobbyists build their own Tribuchet manuscript. But not only like being interested in it as a part of history, but because he's like, he's like this thing, man, it's got fucking 240 horsepower at the wheels. And it's like you're literally traveling faster than light to a different galaxy. You're getting moon pussy left and right, man. You care about like horsepower. Well, yeah, the one iteration of a Star Trek that I thought sort of did the most or at least acknowledged that the holodecks would mainly be used for pornography and just jacking off is Deep Space Nine. Deep Space Nine is the only good starter. That's my favorite series. But like like Cork's bar, he's always like renting out the holodeck, but it's clear that he's just like a sleazy like fleshmonger or whatever. Well, the Frankies are Jewish. They took them a while to just be like, ah, let's just do a Jewish show. And then they went all out. Those would be too obvious. I don't know about that. Oh, fuck. Anything can be had for a price. Gold Press, Latin. They're so ghoulish. Oh, yeah, they were into coins and so I love gold coins. Seriously, no, they really were obsessed with gold coins. They play, you do a spinning top game to win the gold coin. The sexy girl on DS9 was like pretty, Dax was like pretty moderate and she was probably the hottest of all the Star Trek women. Dax? Yeah, definitely. Yeah, and the captain was Obama. Yeah, the captain was Obama who was old friends with Dax, so they had this weird homosexual relationship. Well, the conceit with Dax is that she is like a hybrid of like, like she looks like basically like a human woman with some like freckles on the side, but her body is host to this like alien worm that contains the memories of all of her, all of its past hosts. So she's like an amalgam of like 10 or 12 different people's life experiences. And Cisco was boys with whoever that worm infected like. Oh, shit. So this basically Dax is a woman that got herpes from Cisco's friend. He's like, good to see you, old man. He calls her old man all the time. Does that mean she knows how to fuck so good? She knows how to fuck like 10. She knows how to suck one. Guys know what guys like. That's why it's called deep space nine. Back walls nine. We definitely said Dixuck nine the first time we talked about the S nine. It's a good show. I was like, I didn't know that Odo, I found out recently, because I don't remember seeing it on the show that he just sleeps in a bucket. Yeah, he just turns back into like a bucket of calm. Yeah, hell yeah. Which is so disgusting. Yeah. My girlfriend is watching some fucking show that's like horny Harry Potter right now. So it's called the Magicians. Okay, hell yeah. I've been like in it because I don't give a shit about anything. But it's like, you know, it's fucking they're like, it's some fucking kid with his stupid emo haircut. And then he finds out he's a wizard for real. You know, literally, they just stole. Yeah. But he's like 19 or whatever. He's got an emo haircut and a messenger bag and like a fucking colorful tie, you know, like he rides a longboard to work. Yeah. And I guess I like I caught an episode she was watching the other day and she's like, Well, now they're in the magical world from the books. And it's like, okay, I guess this is it's very similar to Harry Potter, the same thing. But then they visit this like goat character, this homosexual goat character, a pan figure, a pan figure that's supposed to be a God that created this magic world. And I'm like half paying attention. And he hands a cup of his cum. What? To the Magicians. I'm like, what the is that just his is that just his cum? She's like, yeah, she's like, it like makes sense in the story. What? They all just have to take a sip or something. They give it to the fucking girl who's supposed to be the hero and she has to drink his cum. What? It's literally his cum. He beats off into a cup and had the props department create a jar of cum. It looks like cum. Yes, it looks like cum and she has to drink the jar of cum. It's magic. So it tastes like frosting. Yeah. And it's, well, yeah, it's like, that's what my tastes like vampire slayer. There's a cum drinking element, which I guess you were supposed to assume that British scientists that was helping Buffy was doing anyway. Yeah, he was sneaking his cum out like that dentist. Sorry to enter the phone. I was busy reading about a demon 500 years ago. Were you applying this to your skin? No, actually, I never got into Buffy. I really don't give a shit about Joss Whedon at all. Yeah, I never watched it. But I wasn't really into Buffy, but that guy Angel, the woman he fucked. David Boreanus? David Boreanus is Angel. Yeah, but he is girlfriend David Boreanus. Hey, I got a born ass. I got no wrinkles. Looks like a little cheerio. That's kind of a cute ass. Yeah, that doesn't sound boring at all. Have some fun with that. No, charisma carpenter who played someone in that shit. Oh boy, did I beat off to her big motherfucking angle? She was unbelievable. Well, Allison Hennigan became hot from American pie because for some reason, everyone interpreted that Oh, the real girl put a flute in her pussy. Does not make you hot. No, it makes you weird. I don't know. I think that's pretty cool. Would I imagine that that's very pleasurable? No, it's all knobbing shit. Like it's all fucking like, yeah, this is a cold piece of metal that's like thin and covered. Go to Spencer's get a dildo. They're all over the place. Maybe like maybe you suck a flute in your asshole. Maybe that would like be a little bit tight. How did it feel? Well, I just love that Jason was a character in that movie is like, wait, do you have a pussy? That movie sucks. That movie does also very bad. What's the because yeah, he tries to fuck the hot girl, but he comes too quick. Yeah, he can't get hard. What is it? He just he comes in his that's a win. I'm concerned. That's sex. He fucked her pants on Skype in front of his whole school, which is well, that technology did not exist. Yeah, it barely works now. They're like a video conferencing with the entire school. Also, why would you ever do that? You're about to fuck for the first time. Well, that's like a return of Kings thing. They say you should videotape all your sexual encounters. What? In case a woman accuses you of rape. Oh, so like in case a woman just to prevent a woman from falsely accusing you of rape, just videotape her without your consent. Well, I just love the idea of sexless men with fucking 19 security cameras all pointing at their bed in their mom's apartment. You know, they're like, the mom's like, Richard, why is the electricity bill so high this month? It's like, Mom, leave my cameras alone. I remember what I only I only fuck in a panic room. Yeah. Well, I make I make the woman sign a charter written in cursive and sealed with blood. I remember one time I was looking for weed in my college. It was like one of those terrible college houses that ever, you know, just eight people lived in it was just you go in and out or whatever. I just barge into my friend's room and I just found I was looking for weed on his desk and shit and I like he had like one of those books like a hollow book. There was a fucking video camera pointing to his fucking bed. Definitely. It was like one of those like, like, you know, when they record a babysitter without their knowledge. Yeah, this guy was definitely never want to watch myself fuck God. No, oh, God. No, I would love to. I would love to see what I got in the mix. Not you have nothing. Nice moves videotape it and it would you would never get hard again. Dude, first of all, you saw the lack of movement just your fucking fat ass. I fuck with heart and dimpling. I have a beautiful ass number one for especially for a fat man. But I think I would surprise you with the tenacity with which I fuck the heart. You know, I'm a scrapper. I know I'm not fucking got coach ability. I've got coach. I definitely have coach ability. I'll do whatever needs to look like your thighs are trying to give your stomach the Heimlich maneuver. My side of the work from behind the shit did. These muscles did. I don't know if that's muscle. You play back the video and it would be like computer enhance. And then like you'd see the woman checking her phone or something. Adam. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'd be like this is rolling your hands on enhance on enhance. You can see her texting her friends. I think it's the same to what I Adam I've talked to you about are one of our favorite Instagram guys. What is it the Nick 420? Oh, yeah. Yeah. The guy who likes Nick weed. Yeah. Yeah. The guy who just like literally does an Instagram video of him like smoking weed every fucking day. It was just like I wouldn't like this the same thing. Like if you showed me video like of every time I did drugs, I would like kill myself or go straight to rehab. Absolutely, dude. I remember I remember when my friends started skateboarding when we were like fucking like 11 or 12. And then my friend got like a video camera and was like, yeah, let's do jackass. Let's shoot ourselves skateboarding. And it's like, I'm going to go home. Just fucking like how the lack of coordination. Yeah. Like you're like Ali down three stairs. Dude, not you just falling down stairs with a piece of wood underneath you. I that's exactly what happened to me. I was playing basketball and like I was like part of the Greek Orthodox Youth of America basketball league. Do you play on carpet court? Yeah, we play literally in the in my gym at the fucking church that was like bullshit carpet. But I was at this fucking tournament and I stuffed some kid. And I was like, oh my god, I fucking and my mom just happened to be there with the fucking video camera. I was like, this is gonna be fucking awesome. I just imagine myself like fucking getting four feet off the ground and just like spiking in this fucking kid's face. And it was like, I was I was a centimeter off the ground. The kid was like five three, you know, there was like nothing impressive about it whatsoever. Maybe you guys are onto something if I watch myself like it would probably be so terrible. Yeah, I mean, I do a bit about watching myself eat pussy. It was the absolute worst thing in the entire world. I'd like to watch myself eat pussy. No, it's not fun. How did you how did you accomplish that? Because is well, well, I was filming her going down on me and then I started going down on her and I couldn't I didn't have like the dexterity to film and eat pussy. So she took the camera and then I just watched myself just like so emotionally eating a pussy. There's so much earnestness and like love in the way that I was eating her pussy. It was just like to see myself that vulnerable. From that perspective, it probably looked like you're you were nustling your face into Dan Hadea's back. I look like a fucking like a board secretary pinching a phone in between their cheek and their shoulder. No, sir, we're out of stock. No, they won't be in style. I don't know when they're going to be back in stock, sir. But that's because you don't enjoy fucking, dude. Yeah, I don't enjoy anything. That's what I mean. You have no joy in your life. That's true. That's why I think I would that's part of the medical term for that is being really fucking cool. Too cool for school. Yeah. But stop back to your friend who was a surreptitiously assume videotaping himself, sex with women, you know, which is a crime. Totally. No, I don't like that guy at all. I was trying to steal a tweet for the record. He was barely the sort of obsession with the guys filming themselves. Is that a crime? Yeah, for sure. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, to record someone without their permission. You can do it in public because it's like an expectation of privacy. Like if you go outside and just start taping somebody on the street, that's illegal. Yeah. I think basically filming you having sex with a woman without her consent is basically assault. Yeah. Also, I'm saying I believe it's fucked up to do that. I don't know if it's illegal or not. I'm pretty sure it is. But yeah, like the obsession with guys who are obsessed with recording themselves having sex. And I'm wondering if you guys have seen one of my favorite films of all time, autofocus. Oh, yeah. The Bob Crane story. I've seen it. Yeah. Okay, it's directed by Paul Schrader and it stars Greg Keneer and Willem DeFoe. Hell, yes. Hell, yes. In a 100% true story of the life and times of Hogan's hero star Bob Crane and his descent into sex-addicted madness and like swinging and like this is at the very dawn of like videotape technology and shit. And he just became like obsessed with filming himself and like recording and photographing himself having sex with hundreds of different women in this weird like homoerotic, co-dependent relationship with this guy who's his best friend who eventually killed him. Holy, if you say that shit and it's like, I kind of want that for myself. Really? A homosexual, co-dependent relationship. A weird borderline homosexual relationship with an additional heterosexual, deviancy element to it. Where it's all just convoluted in the emotions or, you know, questionable, the morality is as well. That's what I want for myself. I also kind of like the idea of the other person murdering me. The best scene in the movie, though, is that they're like reliving their exploits or whatever and they're like watching it like on his TV through like some ancient video camera and they're just like, you know, fucking a bunch of women and they're just like bodies everywhere. And like, this is sort of early on in the relationship of them doing this shit. And Greg Keneer, the Bob Crane character is like, wait, wait, what's that? Wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, set the tape for a second. And he just, whose finger is that in my ass? And then when the folk character goes, uh, that was me. And he goes, what the fuck, man? And he goes, Bob, Bob, it was a group grope. Come on. A fucking group grope. Yeah, that's the Will Menaker movie recommendation for this episode. That's so good. It's autofocus directed by Paul Schrader. Well, did they ever fuck him? The gate? No, no, but like, yeah, like they would just want it to fuck him though. Yeah, definitely. And they would just like jack off watching each other fuck other people like on video and stuff. So, you know, again, it's all, it's all a gray area. It's better if it's subtext. Have you seen John Wick 2 yet? I have. Is it good? Yeah, thanks. I want to see it, dude. It's a, it was a very satisfying sequel. Oh yeah, dude. Do you feel like because you have the dog, you appreciate it more? Dude, I, before I watched the, I rewatched the first John Wick, like the other week, and I hadn't seen it since getting a dog. And I got to say that shit was even more fucking lit, man. I mean, the same boat. So much more satisfying because like, I mean, the plot of John, the first John Wick is so beautiful. It's like, beautiful. It's like, some asshole kills his dog. Well, my wife died. And in return, he literally kills 100 people. Yeah, yeah. My wife died right before that movie came out. So you really appreciated my wife. I do remember that dog bitch I married for a few weeks. Yeah, it was funny. He's so much more upset about the dog. Why used to live next to, when I'd grown up, I lived next door to a Vietnam vet who had this fucking van, the shitty like late 70s Dodge van. And on the back, it just had a sticker that said, wife and dog missing reward for dog. Nice. And I remember having to have my father explain that joke to me because there's like a fucking spectra mass eight year old. I'm like, but I don't understand why there would be a reward for the dog and not the wife. My dad's saying because, you know, he values the dog more than his wife. I'm like, but that doesn't make any sense. Well, that's the joke side. Is it women or trash? Or like the biker patch that is like, if you can read this, the bitch fell off. Yeah. That guy was a biker too. Of course he was. Yeah, I remember him like being one time because my memory of him for my childhood is just a pair of aviators surrounded by gray hair. This is big, huge beard. And he used to keep jars of piss in the garage and he had a fucking stingray that was always underneath like a car. When were you in his garage? Well, he they had a kid. So I mean, you know, who I wasn't really friends with, but you would have been over there yet a couple times. But yeah, I remember one day being like, oh, I'm going to take you out on my motorcycle. And I went home and I asked my dad, I'm like, can I go ride on their motorcycle? My dad's like, no. Of course not. No, he's a man. Yeah. Yeah, just take you somewhere I don't know where I get alone with his weirdo. Yeah. So you could suck your dick on a little motorcycle. Yeah. You know, it's people videotape themselves. That guy's a weirdo's wife. You used to hear them like fighting. There's like back porch face in front of our house. You could hear just like nine o'clock in the morning fucking beer cans sitting in the recycling bin. And that that is where you do a lot of wife hitting is the back porch. The back porch is well, that's why you build a deck. You build a deck instead of a family. It's always weird to me when people like, okay, they videotape themselves fucking, but people that why are there so many people that videotape women going to the bathroom? That was a Chuck Barry's big thing. He had a whole chain of restaurants that were literally just a front to him videotape women. Chuck Barry the guitar guy. Oh, yeah. The rock and roll guy. But a lot of people do that shit. There says there should be a scene where it's fucking Marty McFly videotaping a woman. By the way, that scene in Back to the Future very racist because it once again implies that white people invented rock and roll. Well, that's why he went back to the future. Yeah. He went back in time to steal rock and roll for whites. Yeah. No, I love that scene specifically for that reason. Because it's such a fuck you. Yeah, it's so fucking. Some suburban nerd. Yeah. Yeah. Chuck Barry got done for that, man. Like he had a whole chain of restaurants that were just literally just so he could have a hidden camera in the women's bathroom. I don't have like a whole fucking library. All the permits you had to get. Yeah. Like that guy loved watching women shit. Video tanks, man. How much work that is to watch women shit. Yeah. I don't know. This is only sort of related. I've never fact checked this. But there was a Johnny Rockets in DC and my friend Brendan was telling me about that they got in trouble because the manager there, a black woman came in and applied for a job at Johnny Rockets and the dipshit fast food manager was like, well, wouldn't really fit the theme if like, you know, like a black lady was working here. Of the 1990s. Oh, right. Like Johnny Rockets. They're like sort of throwback diner, like rockabilly. And so huge lawsuit. Yeah. That's incredibly illegal. And then like three years later, the guy did it again, or a different guy at the restaurant did the same thing. Yeah. Like it was like another discrimination lawsuit. So awesome. Because they're like, we're not allowed to say we can't hire you, but like we can't hire you. I'm imagining that same conversation happening at Colonial Williamsburg. Well, there is one job that pays not great. Yeah, no, yeah, there is a position. Yeah, Eric Andre bit about Colonial Williamsburg. So fucking funny. It's really fucking boring. Oh, no, he also, but he also will know he did the Civil War. He would go through Civil War as a slave. That was a great. I told you guys, right? Have I mentioned on the pod when I went to Gettysburg for the 150. Yeah, I remember you told me you went to Gettysburg and my joke question follow up was like, did you go on ecstasy? And then you're like, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And then you took E and went to like the most hallowed battleground. I went with my ex-girlfriend and her husband now. Now husband. Now husband. Did you see that animatronic like fucking like a general Lee thing that they have? They have like this weird like room. It's like a theater with this like animatronic play that happens. Oh, yeah. It's like the Disney's Hall of Presidents or whatever. According to Sun Presidents Day. Shout out to all the presidents. What I love about Gettysburg is that like it was a decisive victory for the union. But if you go to modern day Gettysburg, it's like, oh, yeah, the South definitely won. There's nothing but fucking rednecks. The trucks and the Confederate flag. Well, that's fireworks. Yeah. Yeah. They love fireworks. That's how I feel about the Vietnam war. It's like, yeah, we lost, but who's who's cleaning who's fat ladies feet now? You know what I mean? It's like, yeah, the Vietnam fuck you. Yeah. Anyway, but I was on drugs there. We were walking around. And there was like, you know, it's obviously you see the fucking Confederates. And it's like, if you're going to bring your fucking whole family dress them all up in Confederate uniforms, including like your five year old kids, like you just hate black people. You just hate. There's no way you're very open minded. Yeah, it's like it's fucking literally accurate. The only reason while Adam is like this Confederate flag feels so good. I was walking around thread count. It was so fucking hot outside. It was 150th anniversary. It was 4th of July because the Gettysburg battle happened on over four days over 4th of July gift shops in Gettysburg. They sell like, like the little Union soldier hats and the Confederates. Yeah, they sell, you know, the old like fucking civil war era stars and stripes, which is the fucking, you know, the circle, the circle, you know, shit. And then they also sell Confederate flags, which are not historically accurate. Like stars and bars. Yeah, there was the the battle flag of Northern Virginia, which looked like the stars and bars, except it was a square battle. But the Confederacy had like a bunch of different flags, but that's culturally decided. This is the flag of the south. Leonard Skinner did that. Yeah, they have that everywhere. But I thought it would be so funny to like just go to one of those gift shops. And when someone's not looking, just put a stack of big, like Nazi swastika, third right flags, just see how many air for sale, and put some rice decks on it and see how long were it would take before someone's like, I don't think these are supposed to be. I guaranteed you they'd move a few of those. Yeah, that was a part of the Civil War. My favorite flag I've ever seen is the one that I saw. I can't remember where I saw it, but it's a Confederate flag, you know, the, the Leonard Skinner fucking Dukes a hat. Yeah, yeah. But then there's a swastika in the middle of it. Yeah, dude, crank it to 11. My favorite shit is the on Eastbound and down where he has the Confederate flag. Hell yeah, Myrtle Beach. I want that. That's so bad. That's so funny. I'm like, all right, fine, Confederate flags are fine. If they all have weed in them, I want Confederate flag. I want Calvin pissing. I want Tasmanian devil. I want weed flag. I want, you know, what's really funny is, if you, I Googled this one time because I was like, this would be hilarious. But I was like, what if there's like a gay Confederate flag, like the rainbow stars bars? And then if you Google it, it's, it's someone made it already. Someone did that bit already. Anyway, but when we were on ecstasy, it was so hot, we were like sweating. Like this was a terrible idea. And they're like, let's go over to those woods, like on the far side of the battlefield for some like tree cover. So we could like rest up. So we go there and that's where like all the union cavalry was with all their horses. And they were like just like getting the horses some shade because it was so oppressively hot. And in the middle of it, there's like a black family. And they were all just like clearly not sanctioned by the reenactors. They were just wearing bonnets and stuff. And they just like made a campfire. They were like barbecuing and stuff. And we're talking to this guy who's like one of the cavalry guys. He's like, you know, they're not supposed to be. And I was like, well, you know, technically, you should think about what, you know, the, the, the poetic, you know, aspect of, of you complaining about, you know, them. I was like, you have like, it's blazing hot out, you're tripping balls and you're like, this is a bad idea. Let's go get some shade. And then you end up on like little big top or like 5,000 people died. Yeah. Excellent energy. Yeah. Why are we doing that? Well, yeah. And that's what I was going to say is Gettysburg is such a boring tourist destination because it is just fields. It's field. It's just a big open field. It's just a big bunch of open fucking fields. And then a couple of shitty gift shops. And it's like the only reason to go is if you think ghosts are real, which they're not. Well, to see the reenactment, it's pretty insane. I've never seen a reenactment. Yeah. See, they're like cool. They were like, yeah, they were like tens of thousands of people there. There was like people from Spain. There were people from Spain there in like Confederate outfits. And they were like, you know, we're here for the because they have always need to find the new uses for our swords. Because Spain does not have enough uses for their swords anymore. Yeah. I'm like, you're from Spain and you came here to be in the Confederacy is like, yes, there was there were the Spanish people who fought for the Confederacy. So we like came from Spaniards are fucking racist. Are they? Oh, yeah. Yeah, dude. In the realm of drid games, they would fucking throw. Oh, yeah, bananas. They would throw bananas at though. Remember, like, there was just a Spaniard in my like eighth grade class. And he was like, he sat next to me. And we're talking one time. I was like, do you like miss Spain? Or like, how are you adjusting to because, you know, you've only been in the country. Yeah, or whatever. And he was like, yeah, you know, Spain's a lot better than America. And I was like, well, in what ways? He's like, well, you know, it's not contaminated like America is. I'm like, maybe like the water. Yeah, yeah. The racial. Well, you know, I mean, like, everyone in Spain is like Spanish, they're, you know, they're the right race. It's like, you're 12 years old. You're so racist. Spain used to be so good, dude. They had like, they own so much shit. And now they suck. Yeah. What was it? Spanish? They did used to be good when Franco was in charge. Yeah. No, but they had a run right before Britain. Everyone had a run, right? They had a huge run. Yeah. Yeah. They had all the keys to doors and shit. Yeah. Yeah. They like fucking conquered the new world. They were really good at sailing the other podcast about Ponce de Leon and how he was Puerto Rican and just imagining Ponce de Leon is like a modern day Puerto Rican. I think it might sound a little. They should get Al Pacino to play Ponce de Leon, to do his Spanish accent. Boy's carriage just has like his name written in fucking old English. We're going to have berets every single day. Oh, fucking little Guadalupe on the dashboard. Yeah. They love parades. Those folks. I'm talking about European racist. It's so weird. Have I talked about how the stereotype of black people in Greece is that they all like to fuck men in the ass? No. For some reason, that's the fucking. I thought that was the stereotype about Greek people. Yeah, I know. Maybe we flipped it. I don't know why. Maybe it's because that's just how racism works and everybody shits on Greek people and they're like, yeah, they just fuck each other in the ass. And then if you're in Greek, you just need to think that about black people. They're even lower than you know, but black people. Yeah. And they all sell. They also bootleg CDs, which is actually true that there's a lot of Africans that sell bootleg CDs in Greece. Or at least that was that was a booming business when I was 11. And I was still over there. Lloyd Banks, young buck. And 50 cent. It's weird. I don't know if you guys are speaking of again, European racism. Yeah, let's get into it. Did you guys see the shit this morning from the prison planet guy? The Sweden. About Sweden. The whole thing about how like Donald Trump said this. Was it an extension of the Fox report that Trump was talking about? And what he was doing is he was like, I will pay like, you know, any leftist journalist who's like making fun of Sweden to like go live in Malmo, like the most dangerous city in Europe and like be hosted by these people. And he just like took some screenshots of clearly he just did a Google image search for like thugs Sweden. Yeah. And like one of the pictures is literally just like some teens on a corner, like looking like just would ask you for a cigarette. It was like the least threatening thing imaginable. Like just like some kids and like scrawny kids and like track pants, selling on a street corner. I didn't see that. I love that. Racists are so such pussies. Have you seen any of that's the basis of the guy from that Fox news article, though the one that Trump like was basically citing or sucker Carlson? I thought well, no, it was because it was maybe it was on Tucker Carlson show. But the report was from Ami Horowitz, who has these videos where he like, he'll be like, I'm here in Times Square talking to fucking, you know, white liberals or whatever. And he finds like one girl that's like, yeah, I think, you know, voter ID laws are racist because, you know, it affects black people's ability to vote or whatever. He's like, hmm, let's see. Let's see how black people feel about that. And he's like, well, I'm here now in Harlem. And he's like, oh, you're a black person. Do you think it's racist that you should be allowed to vote? And be like, no, liberals think it is. By the way, here are the teens. Oh, wow. That should have so funny, dude. I don't know. They do look kind of threatening. This one guy's got Liberty spikes. There's graffiti. This is hold on, dude. This is like three different types. How are these guys hanging out? This look more stage. It's a guy with it. It's a breakfast club. It's a fucking hot topic guy, a like a dundalk. Yo boy. And then a fucking cruss punk. There's no this is this is the kind of cultural mixing that I can't support. I would be hanging out with the fucking tough guy from Degrassi. Yeah, different kinds of clicks. Yeah. Wait, are these guys even Muslim? Yeah. I mean, one of the pictures he used is like a guy pulling up his shirt and had like tattoos on his stomach, but you can literally see him wearing a rosary. Yeah, fuck. Speaking of, you guys said, how do you know they're anal beads? Because they're on his neck coming out of his ass. That's where I like to store them. I like to smell around my neck. I will pay you a million dollars to hang out with this punk from Syria. Wait, this is crazy. Look at this shit. Will that guy actually pay for anyone, dude? No, of course not. Oh yeah. His avatar is hilarious. That's a weird mix on Twitter. Anyway, what's up with Tucker Carlson? He just wears bow ties and that's his thing. I didn't he stop wearing the bow ties? I think he switched that up. I think he used to be his thing. That was his branding 10 years ago. That's how he broke into the business. Because he was like a younger conservative, which like, you know, to find a guy under the age 25 that's willing to be like, actually, black people are stupid. Right, right, right, right. And he wears bow ties and that's, you know, how he got. And then bow ties are trustworthy. He took it from Bill Nye, I think. Did that guy Horowitz, was he the guy that did the Chinatown video for Bill O'Reilly? Jesse Waters. That's like Bill O'Reilly. That guy is such a piece of shit. No, I've seen a couple of, like, Ami Horowitz. All my suggested YouTube videos are like, you know, a sewer, I'm sure. So same high videos. And then like, Trey Gowdy destroys Rapit. Jesus Christ. Trey Gowdy videos are the fucking best. Those are my favorites. He's the guy that he's like ran away from the town hall. He looks so uncanny. He looks weird. But we talked about it. Him and Kasich have this weird thing where they have like the facial, they look like a boy, they look like Billy Quizboy. Right. Not like him, but whatever the Billy Quizboy's problem is. You know, where they just have this sort of like aging deficiency. They look like a like a four year old just sped up time. Yeah, progeria. Yeah, 65 years old. But yeah, the Trey Gowdy, it's always like, he'll have like some immigration activists that are like, these people just need to have a job in a place to live. And he's like, okay, what about, what about Sandra Williamson? She's like, what are you talking about? He's like, well, she was raped and murdered by an illegal immigrant. And actually, we actually have her rape kit here. And we're going to pass it on to her. I don't want everybody to smell this rape kit. It's about her dreams. It's about her dreams and aspirations. Oh, fuck. Yeah. Yeah, he looks terrible. Yeah, actually, well, for how old he is, he doesn't look bad. How old is he? I mean, he's probably like 55. Look at this haircut. Yeah. This is the problem is he doesn't know how to get haircuts, you know, and Kasek is the same thing, where Kasek has like a eight year old boy's haircut. I think he looks cute. What's Kasek up to? Is he still governor now? I don't know. He's fucking quietly asking everyone to be reasonable. Fuck, dude. I was going to bring this up back when we were still talking about people videotaping them, having cells and sex. It's just still in my head. But you know, if you're like me, you've been, you know, I've been checking out a lot of sort of like amateur like Swinger porn recently. I've been on that tip. What? Like Swinger porn. Swinger. Okay. Like, you know, like regular husbands and wives. Yeah. Yeah. Or G's or like, you know, whore their wife out or something like that. Yes. I just got to say, if you do that, that's cool. I enjoy it. But turn the TV off. Yeah. I can't tell you how many of these videos I've watched, where it's like some guys getting spit roasted. But in the background, you can literally hear like the 11 o'clock local news. And clean your living room too. Yeah. Come on. I'm just putting that out as a PSA. I feel like the light is bad. Swing seems like a bad idea to me. Oh, terrible. Just don't be in a relationship. Well, what you guys were the ones who were saying, you said on the podcast once that you wouldn't mind if people fucked your girlfriend. I wouldn't. There's a difference between that and Swinger. Yeah, right. Inviting a bunch of strangers over to your apartment. A bunch of horny strangers. So you're out of shape. Low tea friends can get together because you're somehow not cool enough to join a bowling league. So you have to fuck each other's full watch. They use your wife's sweet pussy as bait for friends. Yeah. Curt does that. Curt and Karen, they're swingers. I don't know, man. Billy, you think you ever get in there, dude? You think the porn is a gateway drug? Is it a gateway to you swapping? Yeah, something like that. Are you into the idea of wife swapping? Well, I'd have to get married first. For me now, it doesn't appeal to me at all, but I need to see a ring. There's that added freesong. There's something about it. I need to see a wedding ring. I love that. There's this genre that's like Romanian orgies or whatever, and it's just a room with people all fucking each other on a pullout couch, like a big, large sectional. Oh, no, no, no. That's nice. It's so gross. It's so gross. I feel like I'm looking at a magic eye. It's like a puzzle. I don't know who to beat off to. Don't focus your if you don't focus your eyes. It's not Romanian. You see a sailboat. It's a cool skull. It's Czech, dude. It's not Romanian. They love. Czech has some great porn, dude. Yeah, they check casting. They check love. Yeah, they love casacats. They love orgies. Czechs cashed. They love to cash. Their mouths love to write checks and then cash them. Oh, yeah. I love those casting videos because it's such terrible acting where it's like, oh, no, we have to have sex now. You know, I always thought it would be like a fun sketch. It's like you have a birthday party for a guy that's in the closet, but it's like a big fat guy, you know, like a flamboyant big fat, like you. Like a cool, like a cool guy. A big fat flamboyant guy, and it's his birthday. He's like, you know, he's very, he's clearly very gay, but like, but he's like, you know, closet or whatever, and they bring out a big cake for his birthday and he's like, oh my God. And then the stripper comes out of the cake and he's like, oh, I thought I was going to eat the biggest cake in the world. That's funny. You should do that. You have fucking disappointed where you'd be. If you thought you were going to get that giant cake and you are gay. Yeah. And there's a woman inside of it ruining the cake. Just like a seagull in under siege. Yeah. You wanted to eat that whole cake too. But now he has a babysit some fucking woman in the home. Doesn't she pop out and like pull her tits? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a good long scene of tits and under siege. And it takes her like fucking five minutes before she realizes the room's empty. She's wearing all these gunshots and like, oh, I guess that's very similar to that that we mentioned it on the last one is in blood sport, the scene where where John Claude Van Dam has fucked a reporter lady and she's waking up the next morning and she wakes up to John Claude Van Dam getting dressed. But the way they directed the scene is like it's her like waking up and she's like, oh, and John Claude Van Dam is over there. So the shot cuts to Van Dam. And the way they directed it was, you know, she's supposed to be waking up and seeing him while he's getting dressed. But they just shoot John Claude Van Dam. So his cue, he stands there on his mark with his pants, his underwear underneath his ass, looking over his shoulder. And then the director goes and action. And then he finished. But the edit point is is like a microsecond off. So it just gives you the impression that he's been standing there pointing his bare as this woman while she's asleep until she wakes up. Do you think if you got it front it, it would be so cool if John Claude Van Dam when he asked his wife to marry her, he like did a full split and then open the ring box or the ring was on his dick. That would be cool. Yeah, when there was the I fucking love blood sport though. Yeah, it's a hilarious movie when the terrorist attack happened in Belgium after the Paris attacks. Yeah, I made an image that's John Claude Van Dam doing the splits in between the Twin Towers and the Eiffel Tower. And he's shitting on to a Quran in the toilet. Satire. Did anyone call them the Paris detects? Never sorry. I apologize. You know, it's real tears. Paris Hilton folks that who are one night in Paris. We've definitely talked about that porno, right? It's not very good. I give it two thumbs down. That reality show is great. Yeah, we have like dumb rich people go and humiliate people from rural America. We don't even know who we're mocking anymore. Was that the simple life? The simple life with Lionel's daughter. Yeah, they had to just get jobs like a fast food place. Yeah, yeah. And then they'd like fuck dudes like at local bars. What dude? I didn't do anything. Did they fuck on that show? Of course. Yeah, they used to like make out with like just like local guys with like their lips full of dip and stuff. Just be like so confused. They're like, yeah, these ladies come from New York now, like now with them. You know, it feels like her whole body's made out of elbows, but she's smell real nice. Yeah, she's smell good to me. She's smell good, but yeah. Oh man. They do they do fist fuck a cow on that show. Oh, yeah, they have to. Yeah, because they're like, they're like, oh, well, we're farmers, but like, I don't know how much of American agriculture is still actual farms and not like, you know, a Monsanto futuristic prison for chicken. Right, right, right. When you commit a chicken thought. Simple life here out on the farm and some big fucking warehouse like sicking their entire arm into a cow's pussy. There was a huge run of like horse and cow, like jerking off horses and putting your whole fist in a cow's pussy. Yeah, Jack has happened in like the early odds. I feel like to collect a bull's semen, you have to stimulate their prostate. So you have to stick your whole arm in their asshole and then collect it. But I think with that, with a cow, with a, with a, with a lady cow, I think you have to do something similar, but like you put like a pipette into the vagina and then you also stick your arm in their ass. I just don't believe we don't have the technology to put a fake arm in whatever is being accomplished with the human arm. We've been to the moon or just let the cow, why can't the cows just fuck? You know, there's enough room and technology to allow, I don't think they've ever figured out how to fuck, dude. I think it's been, they're not 10,000 years. First of all, I don't even know where cows are indigenous from. I don't know where we got their buffalo. I think they, I think they do this with, with horses particularly, because like a stallion can actually kill a mare if you're not careful. Yeah. And yeah, exactly. But like when you're invested like hundreds of thousands of dollars in like a horse or whatever, you can't take chances like that. Sure, sure. Interesting. But the cows, it's whatever. Yeah, cow, like we, we kill them every fucking day. You could also, it's also automation. You know, if you just let the animals fuck, you could fire all the people whose job it is to fist and fluff the heads. Yeah, I'm a fluffer. I've sucked the bull off before he fucks the cow. Well, he doesn't have to use his mouth, but he chooses to. And you know, I say, hey, those are the jobs. If you find a way to make the job fun, I'll say go for it. Me, I bring a little Bluetooth speaker with me. I listen to the almond brothers while I jerk the cow off. Some guys just like to suck the cow. That's what a simple life is. Yeah, we have fun around here. No, those are the, those are the jobs that are coming back to America. Absolutely. Yeah. Hell yeah, dude. We got to stop letting these Malaysian fucks suck all the cow. Some Malay son of a bitch is fucking elbow deep and cow pussy right now. Get the hell out. Oh, fuck. I like Monsanto on Facebook. Oh, nice. And Monsanto has been getting into it to the same degree that Raytheon has the like woke postings. Yeah. Raytheon does it all the time. We're like, we're teaching girls science. I love it. Fucking like, you know, I always share them. We're giving girls in Yemen up close lessons in physics. We're helping them get tans to become more beautiful even though they don't have to. Well, I remember like the like natural gas companies, like they've been trying to have like a sort of open a PR front because everybody thinks fracking is bad. So they're doing like memes now where it's just like that feel when someone tells you like natural gas is bad and it's just like some girl rolling her eyes. That people when that feel when someone says fracking causes their water to catch fire. I think it's cool though, tabloid. The Monsanto ones are good. And what I love is too is because Raytheon still shares all their other shit. So it'll be like, you know, a video of like a classroom and they're teaching girls science, encouraging girls to get into STEM or whatever. And then, you know, fucking morons are like, you know, like, like Becky starfish, you know, or whatever they're dumb, like, you know, Facebook name is like, I love this, this is so great or whatever. And then the next video is like, the fucking Mark two v 18, I see BM, targeted laser guided system. And then the comments and those are always like, you know, a dude that's just a fucking hat picture right. Right. Who's just hates every everything about Obama in the last profile picture is just a fucking rosacea. And you're stupid hat and they comment on all those right here on CPM. There's a one guy went down there's like, America is the you do not fucking have a fucking seizure. Well, commenting No, those are great. But I fucking love all that. The cause marketing from literally evil companies, which I was doing is a joke. Not to like, you know, Hey, just listen up to this thing. I photoshopped four years ago. Yeah. But I did that with all like when when Toastino's made that they did a tweet, which they stole by the way from someone on Etsy. Toastino, they're like pizza roll. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They had a tweet where they took the word gender roles and crossed it off and it says pizza rolls. Oh, nice. And all these people were quote tweeting and like, well, I know what I'm having for dinner. And it's like, you stupid fuck. Yeah. Yeah. They stole that tweet from like some pillow that some girl was selling on like Etsy. Yeah, just stole her idea. They probably compensated her really well. Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, for sure. She's retired. Yeah. So I did a bunch of them where it's like, you know, McDonald's and then like, we're heroes. We let retarded people work here and put it in like every different language or like, you know, Occidental petroleum, like a woman should be able to dig wherever she wants. You know, or like, you know, dole like unions crossed off. You're a same sex. Yeah, like Coca Cola and Bolivia unions. No, thank you. It was two bananas. Along those lines, like a similar genre is something I've been seeing popping up recently where it's like intended to be these heartwarming stories of like perseverance and, you know, discipline among young people. It's like, you know, this is, this is Michael. Like Michael has been collecting recycling every single day and working two jobs while going to school to put himself through college. Don't ever say you can't work hard enough. Like Jesus. I'm just like, this is such a terrible indictment of our society. He's literally collecting trash. He can get an education. Right. What the fuck? He has working three other jobs. He has shittier economics than a hermit crab. He does what a hermit crab does. Plus two more jobs. Yeah, there is a bottom feeding crustacean has a better economic outlook than this human being. Yeah, there was a cost us more money to produce this video than he makes in six months. Yeah. We're not doing anything to change that. There was an Uber thing. It's like, Cheryl's 11 months pregnant and still driving her Uber at that time. Oh, God. Yeah. It's like, Jesus Christ, man. That's horrible. Give her the best part. She was raped in a lift. I know you think. What happened with Uber with that? There's some controversy now. There's some like, you know, it came up in my newsfeed and then my news read refresh. So I don't know what that story is. They're in trouble again though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Some HR shit. Some women get harassed all the time when for Uber. In like the corporate side? Yeah, I think so. Not just by their drivers. Yeah. Which is chill. Yeah. I can't wait till they just cut people out completely. Well, that, I mean, we were talking about the guys who were going to lose their jobs on fisting cows, but a real thing is that like the next, like very soon. Automated cars. Automated like, yeah, self-driving cars. 30 million people are going to be out of work. In a decade or so. Yeah. The cab drivers, that'll be a problem, sure. And like, inner city, you know, courier services are one thing. And especially in Manhattan, I feel like it would still always be faster to have a bike courier than somebody on a car. So for local deliveries and stuff in the city, the real impact is going to be long haul truckers. Long haul truckers who are fucked. And that'll devastate the economies of so many fucking small towns. Yeah. It's 20 to 30 million American men have that. Well, is that, is that when the fucking universal basic income comes in the mix? Well, you know, probably not. Yeah. Yeah. Wouldn't that be cool? Well, here's, here's why the trucker thing is really fucking important is because the, not only does it fuck over like the infrastructure, but it's 90 percent, 90 fucking percent of all borderline racist New York podcast and radio show audiences. Oh, fuck you. I didn't realize what an actual issue these guys are not sitting in the cab of their truck muttering slurs about everyone else on the road all day long. And what do you think they're going to listen to Kumi's show at the mall when they're out of work? No, of course, not. Their ear is swollen from fucking forehead edema. They need the speakers inside the cab. They have cauliflower ear from hate crimes. They've committed over the time over the course of their lives. That guy, that homeless guy, my friends were just hanging out with one night in Rockville that had like, he like, I won the lottery and I'm like, illegally parked behind the old jeepers in the semi. This guy bought a semi doesn't know how to drive it. Yeah, I just love buying electronics and shit. I was like, why are you hanging out with this guy? I just found him. They're buying wheat. They're buying. You got to go, right? We're almost out of time here. Oh, yeah. I thought I could keep going. Oh, okay. Yeah, sure. Yeah, I didn't know if you were on a time crunch. No, no. Yeah, we're having fun. Yeah, that guy was just, just had his this truck that he bought. Yeah, I'm assuming semis cost like $200,000. Well, here's a question like, I see, I'm worried about it because of the horrific economic impact of putting 10 to 20 million people out of work. But I'm also concerned because I feel like what do you trust more when you're driving on a highway and you see like a giant fucking tractor trailer, like some guy that you just described who's like probably like sniffing crank because he's been up for 72 hours driving or just like a fucking computer driving one of those things like that that freaks me out. Well, the thing with you can say that computers are safer than the drivers because of like, well, you know, human error causes them to fuck up. But that doesn't mean that there's not going to be fuck ups. And in the cases of human error, there's more accountability. Right. So if you have if you have a man that fucks up and drives his semi into like, you know, a fucking kills a family or whatever he's an independent contractor, it was that man, there's a clear answer. This is responsible. And obviously, you know, you're not going to get your family back through litigation or whatever. But that's just how justice works. And that's the options we have available to us. If it's some huge patchwork of like automated systems and bullshit, you know, a fucking automated truck drives and through a, you know, a schoolyard and kills a bunch of kids, then it's like, well, who's if we're going to bring the algorithm to court? There's no accountability. No, wouldn't the company be fucking the company, but it's a corporation that's protected by, you know, it's yeah, so they take a fucking ding from the lawsuit. But those core companies are going to be fucking huge. Right. If you don't think it's going to be one or two companies that control all of the, the, you know, domestic, you know, of course, of trucking routes with these automated systems, just like, look at, look at like, like mobile networks, there's four companies in America that control all the mobile networks. And Verizon will continue to do shit that should just be, I mean, it is fucking illegal. They get fined for it, where they'll just decide to discontinue service in an area or something that fucked up and they won't fix it. And they'll just, you know, charge people more money. And eventually they get fined by the FTC. And as fines are immediately passed on to the consumer section on your bill that says like additional surcharges, and then they never see any consequences for it. So you're going to have, if enough of like big companies are able to put out these trucking lines and just literally kill people and fucking write it off as an expense, because the entire, it's a lot different than like the consumer automotive market where you don't, like, you know, there's a lot more competition. You don't necessarily need a car. Right. Back bone of fucking, you know, everything in America, all of our, you know, internal shipping, if you bring those people to court, they're not going to fuck them over to the extent that they can't do business anymore. Right. There's no way to boycott trucking companies. Yeah. They all just fucking. Yeah. Like as you said, Nick, considering like every piece of food you eat is delivered with a truck everywhere in America. Yeah. You think that you think the government, let's say one of those, one of the three companies that gets to control all of those shipping routes or those trucking routes accidentally, oh, we killed, you know, 10,000 people. They're not going to say, okay, well, shut it down. You're going to go out of business. No, they're going to assess some kind of fine that you're, are they going to be class action losses? But that's the scary shit. Is it like computers will probably be fine until they really fuck up. Like I could see like some fucking chip fucking up or some shit. No, I think it'll be worse. It'll be worse at the beginning. And then the fucking system will learn from the mistakes. I think that's how the computers work. I was talking with somebody about Y2K the other day and they're like, yeah, remember how everyone thought that was going to be a big deal? And it wasn't. It was like, uh, it kind of was. There was shit that fucking happened in Y2K that, you know, it wasn't as bad as people thought it would be. But in England, there was a computer program that like determined genetic typing for all these couples and the computer program spit out like, oh yeah, your son's going to have Down syndrome, you better abort. And there's all these people that got abortions. Holy shit. There's all these women that fucking had their kids aborted and they're like, ah, we forgot to carry the one. I'm sorry. That was fucking Y2K did that shit. It's like, uh, you know, but it, you know, the ATMs weren't spitting out money. So there was nothing happened. But yeah, automation is dangerous. I don't trust that shit, dude. I mean, but maybe maybe we're just old mother like, isn't this how people probably talked about cell phones and shit? And like, I mean, they are probably giving us cancer or something. But there's something there is something scarier of cars. They're so fast. It's so fucking. Yeah. But what added convenience do you get out of fucking like automated trucking systems? Well, the argument is that good, the good cell phones, cell phones benefit everybody. It connects people. And yeah, sure. Similar arguments. Similar arguments are made about any kind of technology when like pop fiction came out, people were saying, oh, this is going to just everyone's going to be stupid because they're reading all the time. Right, right, right. Instead of the movie. No, no, the actual genre. Yeah. Isn't that what they said about right? Literally writing in like philosopher, like as they said about the printing press, silent reading became a thing because you used to have to read out loud and people started reading in their head and they're like, don't do that. That's what fucking trash people do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, yeah, sure. But certain things make you smarter. Certain things make you dumb. Like TV definitely makes you dumb, right? No. Reading makes you smart. I think if you're just a dumb person, it's easier to watch TV all the time. Right, right, right. If you don't have to think critically about that. You don't challenge yourself. But then now there's TV that's not completely fucking dumb anymore. That's true. But it's easier to just check out. But at the same time, it's any kind of like visual medium is inherently more passive because it's like it's just being sort of piped into your head. Right. Because you don't control the tempo. You're not, yeah, exactly. Whereas you're reading a novel, you're reading it, but you have to sort of create the world your own head. You have to use your imagination more than just sort of like passively. But it's receding. That's why it's not impossible though to passively consume literature and plenty of people fucking do that. That's why I only listen to radio plays. That's all the media of the mind. I think big corporations and technology are just basically filming themselves fucking the American people. And then they're watching it back and bring it back. Great old time laughing about how dumb we all are. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah, the bigger argument, it's not that like, oh, well, you know, automation is unsafe is that it destroys jobs and when it destroys jobs, it destroys people's lives and it fucking hurts the problem of income and wealth inequality even more. They have automated McDonald's now in New York. And you probably don't see them because they're not in fucking Union Square. They have them all up in Harlem. Right. They have them in places where they want to fire people immediately. Right. Where the people need the jobs. Right. Well, that's also weird because like, you know, McDonald's in particular, really everywhere has like almost become like de facto social services for large segments of the population. You know, so like, what are they going to do when they're completely like untethered from any human contact? Yeah, they're going to write the next great novel. They're going to write the next great song. They're going to make the next great dance. Walmart, too. No, apparently Walmart started hiring more people. Maybe I'm wrong. Well, no, we actually talked about this on my show, but there is an article that came out a while ago about what a huge drain Walmart is on local police departments, right? Yeah, they actually have to have like a cop who's paid with taxes, right? Who has to stay in the Walmart. Yeah. Just keep processing all the people they arrest in Walmart because these stores are like just massive open spaces. They don't hire enough people to actually do real security. There's three people working in a massive warehouse. There's three people working there. When I was in New Hampshire with Felix and Justin, I was in a Walmart and there was dog shit in the aisle, which was amazing. Someone let their dog shit inside. Yeah, it's crazy. The other thing is that they also let people, because they need their employees to do this, they let people stay in cars. You can like in a parking lot 24 hours a day overnight. RV parts, because initially it was for all the old people because they thought it would be nice for old people like the fucking, you know, who aren't going to cause any trouble. And then I thought they reversed that because of vagrants and shit. Yeah, but like vagrancy, but it's just basically like, and then like so much in, you know, like modern American life, like everything is like just sort of, it just like sort of these strip malls off highways, but there's no real like community or main street. And there's no, there's no eyeballs on the street. I mean, like, you know, urbanologists sort of study this like there's a word like eyes on the street is a thing that they think cuts down on crime because it's just like if people are out and about and it's worth like a main street in like a high street in a town or city, it's different. But like now they're just these sort of people just sort of like completely like a macy desiccated like areas of just commerce. So there's like nothing going on. I mean, you can probably get like raped or killed in Walmart. I'm sure it happens. Dude, I was just in Oklahoma. That's exactly how that shit was. It was like, there's nothing, no one. And the closest thing to like a main street or a downtown was Walmart. Like it was possibly like that's where people go to fucking hang and shit like that. Yeah. In Texas, there was a Walmart that had a police like substation in the Walmart. So it was beyond just one officer. The Walmart had its own police station. And it's also not just that they also just pay their employees shit. I'm sure they're all on like a lot of them. I'm sure they don't care people are stealing like yeah, it's just like that's other ways the government fucking subsidizes Walmart's bitch ass. What was that? What was Oklahoma like stuff? You're out there doing a date? Yeah, I was I was doing a casino. It was Cherokee Nation Cherokee Nation. Great gig shots out Lacey. But the actual place was fucking kind of depressing. It was especially casinos make me sad. Yeah, they're super sad. Like what he's he's neglecting. I did it last year when hiking in the Ozarks the morning after and it was amazing. Yeah, it was. Yeah, well, you went with Ari. I went with fucking Bobby. Bobby's not going fucking. I would I would have loved a nice hike. But it was just let's all quietly laugh. How much fucking activity did your bitch ass do? What a day to day. When I was doing pull ups and you came in here. I did. I did. I'll do push ups right now, dude. Yeah, sure. I'm about to finish this fucking half nude. You're like, I'm doing push ups. You look like you're about to eat peeled straight in that back out. Everyone. I just did 40 push ups. That was the grossest push up. The court is short, so I couldn't do like really a really good one. But we need to get you back in pants, dude. Too much of these great radio right now, everybody. I just did a clap push up everyone. Yeah. Yeah, that was like John Plodman, those video broadcasting studios. So we can force you to do exercise and then also jack off a midget and reach for five million of your broadcasting. Yeah, we need to. So what's that? Do you got like a midget sized pussy too? That's interesting. I'll just get sunglasses. Yeah, I don't know, man. It was tough and it's like the food, all the food, like it's hard to be to not eat like shit at a place like that. In a casino. Yeah. Yeah. But even the people that like live there, it's like. That's why San Antonio is the fattest city because you go there and it's like, the way Starbucks is here, it's like that there with fucking Olive Garden. Yeah, it's incredible. Yeah. And like Red Lobster and all those like, you know, what's that tier of chain restaurants called where it's like sit down casual fast casual. Yeah, that's like Panera and shit where I don't know. Red Lobster. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Applebee's Applebee's as far as the fucking I can see you drive around San Antonio and it's all these fucking elevated highways and chain restaurants. Yeah. And then people dress like cowboys on hover rounds. 600 pounds. It's insane how fat they are down there. They all want to be fat cowboys, which is like, first of all, no one would ever let you on a horse. Yeah, that would be fucking animal. You have to ride a fat person riding a horse is one of the funniest images. It is very funny. No, they all look like those twins. Yeah. So I was just going to say one of my favorite. Yeah, one of my favorites of all time, the twins, the big fat twins on the little scooters. Williams to the Wallace twins. Yeah, we ate at Red Lobster when we were in DC and I got to say it was the best dining experience we had there all week. Really? Yeah. Well, this is all a good fake ass. I love those. Yeah, it's all this. Yeah, exactly. It's all the shitty bistros which I hate. But man, those fucking biscuits are so good. I did it up big. I got the admiral splatter, which is just all fried. Yeah, fried. If you finish it, you're actually commissioned as a four star. You're in the Navy now. I did it though. So I didn't get my lapels. Do they get stars in the Navy or like little anchors? Yeah, they're stars. Yeah, they get stars. So all the top tier like officer ranks in the United States Armed Services, I think are stars. Yeah, it's the same in kindergarten too. If you get stars, you like for being good. And as a video hoe, like a five star bitch. Oh yeah, that's the highest level of bitch you could be. Is that five star bitch that Gucci show? I was saying to Nick and Stav yesterday, well, and I'm glad you're on the podcast now, but as an alumnus of the Chapa trap house, I am now technically a pundit, right? Yeah. Yeah, and they should respect you as such. Shut the fuck up, dude. No, you should respect me. I've never disrespected you. I just slapped at everyone when you hear that. I'm MSM. I was doing like a... I'm mainstream media, dude, MSM, pundit. I was bored the other day. So I was doing that like curious cat thing. We're just like anonymous questions from people who follow you on Twitter. And a lot of people were saying like, we love the Adam episode, but just once again, like to remind you that Brendan Wardell is your worst guest ever. Never have been back on. I will open it. I will burn down a hospital for every... Got his feelings hurt because now people don't like him and he's blaming it entirely on us. Yeah, whatever, man. Who cares? I care. I like Brendan. I'm not trying to be mean to him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It is funny. Nobody likes Brandon. We don't have to lie about it. Brandon's great, guys. Please stop bullying him. Please stop hurting his feelings. We don't want to get blamed for it anymore. Yeah, fuck. Well, just don't do it. Yeah, it is funny, but internet hate is hilarious. How much hate did Adam get? Any nice hate for Adam? Oh, this is funny, actually. Someone got mad that we... Someone got mad at Adam because we... Just some random person was just like, hey, like the show, but I got to say, like, not too happy about, like, you know, on the most recent episode when you sexualized the teenage girl. And I was like, what? And it was when we were talking about... Popcorn's girlfriend. We were talking about Instagram savage and legend popcorn. And like, I was making the point that, like, he's this sort of like goofy... He's this sort of fat, curly hair, white kid who, like, thinks he's like a rapper, but like, on his Instagram, like, he is, like, cooking up with, like, hot women. And I didn't... Really? For a high school kid. For a high school kid. For a high school kid. Yeah. How are you? I love the spectrum of, like, shows. You can't say that they're hot, though. You have chapel on one end, and then I did Legion of Skanks the other night, where Lewis brought a homeless man onto the podcast, tried to steal his cocaine, and tried to put his false teeth in his mouth. God. And he's like, just give me your fucking teeth, dude. Jesus. Dude. That is so fucking disgusting. Can you imagine? That's insanely gross. He's doing that just voluntarily for not even a great laugh, probably. I mean, I'm still laughing about it. I think it's pretty funny. What do you literally put the teeth in his mouth? And then people getting mad about saying that Popcorn's girlfriend is hot. Yeah. Like, if we said, oh, dude, I want to fuck Popcorn because she's 16, you know? Exactly. We didn't say we wanted to fuck her. We just said he did all right for fat, chubby, curly-head, you know, a Kentucky white boy. Good for him, man. Yeah, whatever. I'm not going to apologize for sexualizing. Popcorn is white Lutarian Milton. Of course. Yeah. I love Lutarian. Lutarian's got his life together. I know. Which is not surprising. I mean, of course. If you G out that hard as a fucking eight-year-old. We got to get the hood shit out of your system early. Where the fuck else is he going to go except Harvard? That's why, like I said, I'm glad Pop did his home invasion and assault with a deadly weapon. He'd waited a little bit longer. What a shit would have been a lot more time for him. He would have gone to adult prison and they would have not liked his rapid. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, the fucking Lutarian was so hard as an eight-year-old, like Obama would have never, if it was Lutarian, Obama would have never said if I had a son. Never happened with Lutarian. I don't know Lutarian. I've never met Lutarian. I don't know who Lutarian is. Please do not compare me to that boy. The boy beat up his grandmother for chicken wings. God, he was awesome. What does he do? He stole a car. He stole a car. He stole a car. He stole his grandma's car. Smashing it away because he couldn't see above the dashboard because his friend came over and his friend was smoking cigarettes. And he smoked with cigarettes. He smoked with cigarettes. Because I want to do hoodratch shit with my friends. I want to do hoodratch stuff with my friends. That's kind of so cool. That's what fucking unbridled childhood freedom looks like. In a perfect world, every boy would be able to do that. Absolutely. Oh my god, yeah. We need a holodeck for boys. Yeah. And they all could be Lutarian. Bring it all full circle, yeah. And that'll be it. This is a holodeck for boys. All right. Thanks, Big Dick Billy. Yeah, you got anything you want? No, no. Just always a pleasure. Any day without cum is a waste of money. That's right. That's right, brother. Yeah, chapeau, trapeaus. I'm sure there's a lot of overlap. Anyways, but if you don't listen, check it out. It's great. You guys were fun. Thanks.",
