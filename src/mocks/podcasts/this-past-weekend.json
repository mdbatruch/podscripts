There was a it must be fun to see that as like a and we're talking about lunatics for people that haven't checked it out\"},{\"currTime\":331,\"text\":\"It must be great to see like in the beginning a guy like Dylan an actor like him kind of you know\"},{\"currTime\":338,\"text\":\"Learning his way, but by the end him starting to get that confidence and stuff. Is that pretty cool to see as a director?\"},{\"currTime\":342,\"text\":\"Yeah, I was unreal\"},{\"currTime\":344,\"text\":\"There's a lot of scenes where we drive off in this little\"},{\"currTime\":347,\"text\":\"Yeah, and I had to like pull out the audio because as we drove off he was like fuck slow down\"},{\"currTime\":353,\"text\":\"Yeah, I can't like swear\"},{\"currTime\":355,\"text\":\"Swearing at me and just like he was just he got into it so much.

So yeah, pull him out pull the audio out\"},{\"currTime\":365,\"text\":\"You had to take him aside sometimes a little a little bit\"},{\"currTime\":369,\"text\":\"But I just usually these people that we cast you kind of just roll with whatever you've you've got like you've\"},{\"currTime\":375,\"text\":\"You've chosen them for a reason and you just make the best of what they have rather than trying to shape them too much\"},{\"currTime\":380,\"text\":\"Yeah, and do you do or most of your casting as well? Yeah, well, I choose all the people that I'm\"},{\"currTime\":386,\"text\":\"I have a really great team of casting people that find them\"},{\"currTime\":390,\"text\":\"They literally got find them off the street\"},{\"currTime\":392,\"text\":\"They walk around the streets and find them or they'll just like rock up to schools or whatever\"},{\"currTime\":398,\"text\":\"It's they'll go anywhere\"},{\"currTime\":400,\"text\":\"Yeah, because it's so specific the kind of people we need that you have to like search far and wide\"},{\"currTime\":406,\"text\":\"Yeah, it must be that it seems like you almost need\"},{\"currTime\":410,\"text\":\"Like kind of a garden you set up a garden and you're kind of the the rabbit in a way\"},{\"currTime\":415,\"text\":\"so it's like every the other people are still amazing people and humans and everything but it's almost\"},{\"currTime\":422,\"text\":\"Does that make any sense to you?

That's exactly it\"},{\"currTime\":438,\"text\":\"And it takes a while to find those people also you don't because they're real people\"},{\"currTime\":443,\"text\":\"I mean not all of them some of them have some acting experience, but a lot of them are real people and\"},{\"currTime\":448,\"text\":\"They're they behave a certain way in the audition and then when you're on set it's kind of like oh shit\"},{\"currTime\":453,\"text\":\"There's Chris Lee. Oh, he's in a wig. He's wearing at me and they kind of become a bit different\"},{\"currTime\":458,\"text\":\"So you kind of have to adapt to the new version of them. Mmm\"},{\"currTime\":463,\"text\":\"Because you can't talk them back into the regular versions sometimes it's kind of hard, I guess\"},{\"currTime\":467,\"text\":\"I try to a little bit, but then it makes them lose confidence. So\"},{\"currTime\":472,\"text\":\"Sometimes I'm like I'll fix it in the edit\"},{\"currTime\":475,\"text\":\"But I mean they do that the great thing about that is then you get these magic moments where they just\"},{\"currTime\":480,\"text\":\"They do these things that actors never do like any like shit. That's so real and good and\"},{\"currTime\":487,\"text\":\"Yeah, is it hard for you sometimes when you know a moment like that is because I can imagine they're probably\"},{\"currTime\":493,\"text\":\"Times were in a scene. You know a moment just happened. That was so perfect that it's like\"},{\"currTime\":499,\"text\":\"Is it hard sometimes to\"},{\"currTime\":501,\"text\":\"You're you able to notice those as they happen kind of sometimes? Yeah, you're in it you\"},{\"currTime\":506,\"text\":\"Yeah, you see it when it happens. Yeah, and then a part of me is also like watching the cameras\"},{\"currTime\":512,\"text\":\"And I've told those guys what to do while they're doing things\"},{\"currTime\":515,\"text\":\"I can see the way the cameras are moving at the same time like oh shit\"},{\"currTime\":518,\"text\":\"They covered it awesome. Got that. Yeah, like because we have two cameras rolling at the same time and\"},{\"currTime\":523,\"text\":\"Yeah, it's a weird thing and I can sort of I'm editing it in my head as I'm doing the scene\"},{\"currTime\":528,\"text\":\"I don't know. I'm not trying to make myself sound. No, it doesn't sound like you're I'm just like it's a weird process\"},{\"currTime\":534,\"text\":\"And you're like, oh shit, that's gonna work. Yeah, cool. I only covered that and then I'll cut there. It's that's exciting\"},{\"currTime\":540,\"text\":\"Well, there's not a lot of people that do that have ever done really kind of what you what you do, you know, it's rare\"},{\"currTime\":546,\"text\":\"It's extremely rare. I think man like I\"},{\"currTime\":549,\"text\":\"Don't know. I mean Ari and I were talking about yesterday that does like\"},{\"currTime\":555,\"text\":\"You know in the US we have who's that guy Ari?\"},{\"currTime\":557,\"text\":\"Yeah, a little bit of Sasha Baron Cohen, but his some of his stuff is a little more mean-spirited I think where\"},{\"currTime\":568,\"text\":\"Yours is just kind of like this\"},{\"currTime\":571,\"text\":\"World that is just so\"},{\"currTime\":573,\"text\":\"It's all about fun. It seems like a lot of times\"},{\"currTime\":576,\"text\":\"Is that the vibe on set or does it get sometimes a little bit?\"},{\"currTime\":579,\"text\":\"Too mad like you have to manage so much that it's hard to stay in the fun stuff\"},{\"currTime\":583,\"text\":\"It's probably more it's a little bit more serious, but it's pretty relaxed and kind of peaceful. It's it's a really quiet\"},{\"currTime\":591,\"text\":\"Thoughtful kind of set like it's not\"},{\"currTime\":594,\"text\":\"Yeah, that's not people aren't like often you have like a first first AD that\"},{\"currTime\":599,\"text\":\"We'll be yelling at everyone, but in our world. It's just very peaceful and he talks quietly and\"},{\"currTime\":605,\"text\":\"It's just about getting those moments because I've thought it through so much before we get on set\"},{\"currTime\":610,\"text\":\"Mm-hmm that I just know I need these little moments. So\"},{\"currTime\":614,\"text\":\"It's not like everyone's laughing their heads off the whole time.

yeah\"},{\"currTime\":988,\"text\":\"And people laugh at it, my family thought it was hilarious\"},{\"currTime\":991,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":992,\"text\":\"Oh, yeah, that's great\"},{\"currTime\":993,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":994,\"text\":\"There's a lot of photos of it\"},{\"currTime\":996,\"text\":\"Oh, that's crazy\"},{\"currTime\":998,\"text\":\"Do you, I remember it, sometimes I'll be honest, I would lay in the water in the bathtub, right?\"},{\"currTime\":1003,\"text\":\"And just pee straight up in the air onto myself\"},{\"currTime\":1006,\"text\":\"Yeah, same\"},{\"currTime\":1007,\"text\":\"Oh, that's really good\"},{\"currTime\":1008,\"text\":\"It was good, man\"},{\"currTime\":1009,\"text\":\"I just saw, oh, you know what?\"},{\"currTime\":1012,\"text\":\"I just saw the scene last night I was up watching Lunatics of the one\"},{\"currTime\":1017,\"text\":\"Where the, your character, the large buddy realistic guy when he urinates his mouth\"},{\"currTime\":1027,\"text\":\"Yeah, yeah, he loves that\"},{\"currTime\":1029,\"text\":\"When he's showing the girl Paige, when she's sitting down\"},{\"currTime\":1031,\"text\":\"He thinks it's amazing\"},{\"currTime\":1032,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1033,\"text\":\"And it is\"},{\"currTime\":1034,\"text\":\"Like\"},{\"currTime\":1035,\"text\":\"It was good, man, it was exciting\"},{\"currTime\":1038,\"text\":\"But yeah, I remember being, it was so much fun when you were young, man\"},{\"currTime\":1042,\"text\":\"Yeah, making the family laugh, that is definitely a thing\"},{\"currTime\":1046,\"text\":\"And then you just become a big version of that, I guess\"},{\"currTime\":1049,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1050,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1051,\"text\":\"Did you, did you realize like, because I remember when I was young\"},{\"currTime\":1056,\"text\":\"I would make kids at school laugh, you know\"},{\"currTime\":1058,\"text\":\"But I never realized that it would be able to translate into doing it like on a stage and stuff, you know\"},{\"currTime\":1063,\"text\":\"In a bigger environment\"},{\"currTime\":1064,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1065,\"text\":\"Did that kind of happen for you? Like, was there a part where you realized like\"},{\"currTime\":1070,\"text\":\"Because it's kind of scary to think that one of your talents, something you do\"},{\"currTime\":1074,\"text\":\"Could be like a marketable talent, it's almost like a\"},{\"currTime\":1079,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1080,\"text\":\"It's almost cheesy, yeah, it ruins it a little bit, it's like\"},{\"currTime\":1083,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1084,\"text\":\"But then you're like, I can have a normal job or I can do this cool thing and\"},{\"currTime\":1088,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1089,\"text\":\"Yeah, it's sort of worth it\"},{\"currTime\":1091,\"text\":\"Do you know like a lot of your characters have they been with you since you were young\"},{\"currTime\":1097,\"text\":\"Or some of them are brand new, some of them are things you just see off of people on the street\"},{\"currTime\":1100,\"text\":\"And you're like, oh, I could do that guy\"},{\"currTime\":1102,\"text\":\"Yeah, it's usually a combination of like things that, of ideas that you collect over a really long period\"},{\"currTime\":1109,\"text\":\"So it's not like it's ever one person or one thing you've seen\"},{\"currTime\":1113,\"text\":\"Sometimes it's like a leftover concept from another show\"},{\"currTime\":1117,\"text\":\"And that's the kind of start of something\"},{\"currTime\":1119,\"text\":\"But then it just evolves along the way\"},{\"currTime\":1123,\"text\":\"It's sort of out of, I feel like it's out of my control as well\"},{\"currTime\":1127,\"text\":\"Like it kind of, without trying to like stand in like a way and go\"},{\"currTime\":1130,\"text\":\"It sort of, it comes alive and I don't really have that much control of it\"},{\"currTime\":1134,\"text\":\"It's like, you put the things in place, you know what they're going to look like\"},{\"currTime\":1139,\"text\":\"And there's the story, but the way they kind of move and the way they sound\"},{\"currTime\":1144,\"text\":\"And everything, it just comes together literally on the first day when we're on set\"},{\"currTime\":1148,\"text\":\"Because I had an idea for all the hair and stuff\"},{\"currTime\":1151,\"text\":\"But then the hair guy was like, well, why don't you try this?\"},{\"currTime\":1154,\"text\":\"And it kind of evolved really differently\"},{\"currTime\":1157,\"text\":\"But you don't get to see all the elements together until literally like boom on the first day\"},{\"currTime\":1161,\"text\":\"Like that Quentin character, the first thing we filmed was around the pool when he's having his 30th party\"},{\"currTime\":1167,\"text\":\"And I didn't really know what he was going to sound like\"},{\"currTime\":1169,\"text\":\"Like I kind of, I knew the character, I knew what he was about\"},{\"currTime\":1173,\"text\":\"But he really just came alive in that moment\"},{\"currTime\":1176,\"text\":\"Like around the pool with his mates and they're all going out\"},{\"currTime\":1180,\"text\":\"And yeah, I was like, okay, this is who he is\"},{\"currTime\":1185,\"text\":\"But sometimes people don't get that and they often say to me, I really like the voice\"},{\"currTime\":1189,\"text\":\"Or like, I just love how she moves or something\"},{\"currTime\":1193,\"text\":\"I'm like, how am I moving? I didn't, I haven't noticed it\"},{\"currTime\":1196,\"text\":\"Oh, I see, like those things weren't even part of the plan\"},{\"currTime\":1198,\"text\":\"No, I haven't practiced, I'm not, I don't stand in front of a mirror doing this kind of thing\"},{\"currTime\":1202,\"text\":\"It just, it really just comes alive on the day\"},{\"currTime\":1206,\"text\":\"It sounds strange, but it's\"},{\"currTime\":1208,\"text\":\"It doesn't sound that strange to me, I can understand a little bit\"},{\"currTime\":1210,\"text\":\"Yeah, well, I've thought about it a lot and I know what the story is and I know what they're going to say\"},{\"currTime\":1216,\"text\":\"And the scripted lines and everything, but it, the combo of everything comes together on the day, yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1223,\"text\":\"Like that, the Gavin character, he was sitting on his bed back at the Adelaide house\"},{\"currTime\":1227,\"text\":\"And started talking, but I was like, this is kind of how kids talk, I think\"},{\"currTime\":1231,\"text\":\"And it was really slow and I was like, it didn't have the rhythm of something that should be funny\"},{\"currTime\":1236,\"text\":\"But I was like, I think it's better to just make it real, like make it exactly how I think 12 year old boys talk\"},{\"currTime\":1243,\"text\":\"And that'll ultimately be funnier than trying to be kind of quirky and have that funny rhythm that people usually do\"},{\"currTime\":1250,\"text\":\"Yeah, because some of that I'm noticing in some of that it's like, there's something like going for the joke\"},{\"currTime\":1258,\"text\":\"And then there's something like, I trust that this will be funny later and I just have to let it, yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1268,\"text\":\"Like sometimes there's a moment I notice in myself where it's like, there's a little thing that goes on my head\"},{\"currTime\":1274,\"text\":\"It's like, if I don't say anything else or make another sound or another movement right here, then this is going to land really, really good\"},{\"currTime\":1281,\"text\":\"But if I do anything else, if I look or move or anything or say one more word, it pops the balloon\"},{\"currTime\":1289,\"text\":\"So I can imagine there's some unique moments where you're doing those characters where you probably really land in like a special spot\"},{\"currTime\":1296,\"text\":\"You're like, oh, this is a good spot for this character right now\"},{\"currTime\":1299,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1300,\"text\":\"And so cool, man, because it's just such a, because then the reward is all for the audience\"},{\"currTime\":1305,\"text\":\"The reward is all, you know, they're going to love it, you know\"},{\"currTime\":1309,\"text\":\"It's so cool, man\"},{\"currTime\":1311,\"text\":\"The hard thing is you have to really block out trying to impress the people around you, like the crew and the cast\"},{\"currTime\":1317,\"text\":\"If the moment's awkward and not funny, it's okay because it'll come together later\"},{\"currTime\":1324,\"text\":\"But yeah, it's sometimes you have to really remember it's not about pleasing the people around you, it's about the end result\"},{\"currTime\":1330,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1331,\"text\":\"So you get over that and just, yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1335,\"text\":\"No, it's interesting, man, it's a...\"},{\"currTime\":1339,\"text\":\"Yeah, because then it's interesting because part of which, or what I always noticed with my original thing was to make the people around me laugh\"},{\"currTime\":1348,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1349,\"text\":\"So it's then whenever you're taping something, sometimes you have to sacrifice that\"},{\"currTime\":1354,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1355,\"text\":\"To know that it's going to make, it's going to play better in this other way\"},{\"currTime\":1360,\"text\":\"Yeah, I think when you were saying making this kid's laugh at school\"},{\"currTime\":1364,\"text\":\"I used to do that, but in a more kind of thought out, planned way\"},{\"currTime\":1368,\"text\":\"Like I wasn't the class clown, the loud kid, but I would plan out a thing like a funny scripted thing that I was going to just do\"},{\"currTime\":1376,\"text\":\"If I had to do a speech, I would write out something really funny and then I just get up and do something kind of shockingly funny\"},{\"currTime\":1383,\"text\":\"Rather than I wasn't the kid yelling shit out from up the back\"},{\"currTime\":1386,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1387,\"text\":\"In primary school days, I remember like you had to, I don't know, drawings and stuff, I'd always do something really funny that incorporated like some in-joke about the teacher or something\"},{\"currTime\":1397,\"text\":\"But it was planned out, it wasn't sort of the loud funny guy thing\"},{\"currTime\":1401,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1402,\"text\":\"Which seems to be what I like to do\"},{\"currTime\":1405,\"text\":\"Yeah, I was never the class clown, I was never like a physical, I was never physical, I was always like in my head, I was like, oh this would be a time, I was a verbal\"},{\"currTime\":1415,\"text\":\"I was more verbal than I was physical\"},{\"currTime\":1419,\"text\":\"Yeah, I still wanted the people around me to laugh, like I loved it that you get up and do the speech and they laugh, it was so fun\"},{\"currTime\":1426,\"text\":\"Do you remember sometimes the fact that they would even continue to let you go back up to the front of the class after you'd already been funny other times?\"},{\"currTime\":1433,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1434,\"text\":\"And ruin the teacher's day and she's again going to let you go up and do anything\"},{\"currTime\":1438,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1439,\"text\":\"The teachers just secretly they're like kind of bored and wondering what they're doing with their lives and they're like, hang on, this is gonna, this will be like a little wrong but it'll entertain me\"},{\"currTime\":1448,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1449,\"text\":\"Sometimes there was no like educational kind of content in what I was saying but the teachers would give me full marks, they'd be like, you made my day\"},{\"currTime\":1457,\"text\":\"And you just, yeah it's awesome\"},{\"currTime\":1460,\"text\":\"I started to work out that if you actually pretended to be the teachers so I'd get up and do like speeches as them and um\"},{\"currTime\":1467,\"text\":\"They would get keen to it\"},{\"currTime\":1469,\"text\":\"Or some other kind of controversial teacher at the school and it was like, it can't leave the classroom but I said this\"},{\"currTime\":1476,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1477,\"text\":\"That was fun\"},{\"currTime\":1479,\"text\":\"That's fun man, it was so fun being young like that just to be free, you know\"},{\"currTime\":1483,\"text\":\"Yeah, it was good\"},{\"currTime\":1486,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1488,\"text\":\"And there was no, it didn't have to lead to anything, it was just that moment of being funny and then you'd be thinking about that forever\"},{\"currTime\":1496,\"text\":\"Yeah and then reenacting with your friends or talking about how funny it was, that was so much better, now it's all captured\"},{\"currTime\":1503,\"text\":\"So it kind of, it spoils it some\"},{\"currTime\":1506,\"text\":\"Yeah and it gets judged for weird reasons and analyzed too much I guess\"},{\"currTime\":1511,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1512,\"text\":\"Well that's one of the cool things that's been about podcasts, it's like all, that shit is dying in the US like all of that like\"},{\"currTime\":1518,\"text\":\"Because there was no fan base for it, it was just like clickbait online, you know, there was no real, you know, people judging stuff, it was just\"},{\"currTime\":1526,\"text\":\"Losers sitting around at home with not just on their computers and people, lonely people writing articles, it wasn't actual funny people who like to laugh\"},{\"currTime\":1534,\"text\":\"Expressing themselves because they're busy, living their lives\"},{\"currTime\":1538,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1539,\"text\":\"But now it's like, with podcasting so many more people are just having a good time again\"},{\"currTime\":1544,\"text\":\"And so much less judgmental, in the US anyway, I'm noticing it growing\"},{\"currTime\":1548,\"text\":\"But I don't know if it's the same here probably\"},{\"currTime\":1552,\"text\":\"Yeah I guess it would be, it seems to be getting really huge the whole podcasting and I can see why\"},{\"currTime\":1560,\"text\":\"Yeah, it's uncensored and you really feel like you get to know the person you're listening to\"},{\"currTime\":1566,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1567,\"text\":\"I think it's good\"},{\"currTime\":1569,\"text\":\"Did you, so when you made your family laugh when you were young, did you make like your mother and father laugh too or no?\"},{\"currTime\":1575,\"text\":\"Yeah, yeah, they were the main ones laughing\"},{\"currTime\":1577,\"text\":\"Oh really?\"},{\"currTime\":1578,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1579,\"text\":\"That's cool\"},{\"currTime\":1581,\"text\":\"Was it fun to make your parents laugh? Like who was the funnest to make laugh in your family?\"},{\"currTime\":1585,\"text\":\"Probably my oldest brother, yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1588,\"text\":\"And I mean he would make me laugh, like so we had a kind of, and still does, like we had a good thing together\"},{\"currTime\":1594,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1595,\"text\":\"One of my favorite things that he did when I was little was, I used to go to bed really early and he was a teenager so he would stay up\"},{\"currTime\":1602,\"text\":\"But it was really dark and he used to sneak in my room and like jump on my bed and pretend that he was my Chinese mother\"},{\"currTime\":1609,\"text\":\"And did this like ridiculous stereotypical accent\"},{\"currTime\":1614,\"text\":\"But the whole concept was that the Chinese mother used to sneak in at night to try to steal me back\"},{\"currTime\":1619,\"text\":\"Because I was actually a Chinese kid that had had an operation to make my eyes wide\"},{\"currTime\":1624,\"text\":\"And then he'd do the whole like, I can't do the accent, I'll get in trouble, but\"},{\"currTime\":1629,\"text\":\"Here, I'll do it, let me try, okay?\"},{\"currTime\":1632,\"text\":\"Oh, you're coming home!\"},{\"currTime\":1634,\"text\":\"There it is\"},{\"currTime\":1637,\"text\":\"Yeah, this is your Chinese mother\"},{\"currTime\":1640,\"text\":\"Anyway, he used to do that and then he'd run out of the room and then he'd come back in as himself\"},{\"currTime\":1645,\"text\":\"And he'd be like, oh Chris, there was this Chinese woman running down the driveway, she seemed really freaked out\"},{\"currTime\":1651,\"text\":\"And I'd have to pretend I didn't know anything about it\"},{\"currTime\":1654,\"text\":\"And it used to make me laugh so much\"},{\"currTime\":1656,\"text\":\"He did a lot of those, but my Chinese mother was one of my favorites\"},{\"currTime\":1659,\"text\":\"That's so cool that he did that because then it leaves you, because then he goes to bed or whatever\"},{\"currTime\":1663,\"text\":\"And it leaves you in your bed laying there with this expansive idea of what can be funny\"},{\"currTime\":1669,\"text\":\"There's a woman out in the world that's a fake woman\"},{\"currTime\":1672,\"text\":\"There's your brother who's just asleep in the other room, there's you laying there with your eyes and your spirit wide open\"},{\"currTime\":1677,\"text\":\"It was so exciting\"},{\"currTime\":1679,\"text\":\"I'm still thrilled by it\"},{\"currTime\":1681,\"text\":\"I mean, that's an example of him being hilarious to me\"},{\"currTime\":1684,\"text\":\"So I think it kind of got me excited about those ideas\"},{\"currTime\":1689,\"text\":\"Do you think that humor creates a special bond between family members and stuff like that?\"},{\"currTime\":1694,\"text\":\"Yeah, definitely\"},{\"currTime\":1700,\"text\":\"I kind of imagine people that don't find things funny\"},{\"currTime\":1703,\"text\":\"That's my whole relationship with the family is everything's a joke\"},{\"currTime\":1707,\"text\":\"I messaged my mom like every day and it's always something funny\"},{\"currTime\":1711,\"text\":\"Yeah, I mean there's lots of in-jokes and sort of funny stories\"},{\"currTime\":1717,\"text\":\"But yeah, it definitely bonds people together\"},{\"currTime\":1721,\"text\":\"Do you guys, does your family have a good regular connection as well?\"},{\"currTime\":1725,\"text\":\"And then you also have the humor connection?\"},{\"currTime\":1727,\"text\":\"Or is the humor connection kind of like a...\"},{\"currTime\":1730,\"text\":\"Does it kind of suffice for you guys is the way you guys kind of emotionally connect to each other\"},{\"currTime\":1735,\"text\":\"If that's something that's a bizarre question or not\"},{\"currTime\":1737,\"text\":\"Yeah, I think, yeah, it's not two things\"},{\"currTime\":1739,\"text\":\"It's like we talk about regular stuff but it always has a bit of a funny take\"},{\"currTime\":1743,\"text\":\"And it's that kind of piss-take Australian humor thing where you're kind of like putting someone down\"},{\"currTime\":1749,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1750,\"text\":\"Yeah, my mom's thing is about how she's to say we're all thick, like not very smart\"},{\"currTime\":1755,\"text\":\"And so that's her whole thing is that she, in the family, she's the one that had the thick kids\"},{\"currTime\":1760,\"text\":\"Especially after hearing about how thick your head was\"},{\"currTime\":1763,\"text\":\"Oh, yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1765,\"text\":\"She should have known out of the gate this one's going to be a bit thicker than most\"},{\"currTime\":1769,\"text\":\"Yeah, so she still runs with that angle that like we're really stupid\"},{\"currTime\":1774,\"text\":\"She's not wrong\"},{\"currTime\":1777,\"text\":\"She must be really proud of you, huh?\"},{\"currTime\":1779,\"text\":\"Yeah, I think she's really into it\"},{\"currTime\":1781,\"text\":\"Yeah, she's...\"},{\"currTime\":1783,\"text\":\"She, yeah, really appreciates it and I think so\"},{\"currTime\":1788,\"text\":\"We don't really talk about it in that way so much\"},{\"currTime\":1791,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1793,\"text\":\"She's always telling me people that she works with and friends and stuff that are loving it\"},{\"currTime\":1798,\"text\":\"So I think she's into it\"},{\"currTime\":1800,\"text\":\"That's cool, that must be, yeah, for a mom that's pretty cool\"},{\"currTime\":1803,\"text\":\"Yeah, my mom said she wore a t-shirt on mine\"},{\"currTime\":1805,\"text\":\"Because my mom first came to Sony, she hadn't seen me performing about five years until a couple of weeks ago\"},{\"currTime\":1810,\"text\":\"And she, um...\"},{\"currTime\":1812,\"text\":\"I gave her just like a merch t-shirt, you know\"},{\"currTime\":1814,\"text\":\"She was just enamored by\"},{\"currTime\":1816,\"text\":\"She talks about it every day now\"},{\"currTime\":1818,\"text\":\"And it's got your head on it\"},{\"currTime\":1819,\"text\":\"It's pretty lame, but she likes it, you know\"},{\"currTime\":1822,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1823,\"text\":\"And she wore it somewhere and some young guy came up and said something to her\"},{\"currTime\":1827,\"text\":\"And, uh...\"},{\"currTime\":1829,\"text\":\"Yeah, it's just like the most...\"},{\"currTime\":1831,\"text\":\"Yeah, there's something for me anyway about making my mom feel proud that really just like\"},{\"currTime\":1836,\"text\":\"Makes me feel okay, you know\"},{\"currTime\":1838,\"text\":\"Makes me feel like a different level of okay than I'm normally able to make on my own, you know\"},{\"currTime\":1843,\"text\":\"Because the kind of thing we do, it takes a while to get to the level where it's like your job and it's perceived as a successful thing\"},{\"currTime\":1851,\"text\":\"So there's many years where I'm sure parents are like, what the fuck am I doing?\"},{\"currTime\":1856,\"text\":\"Like, I fucked this up\"},{\"currTime\":1858,\"text\":\"Yeah, what am I doing?\"},{\"currTime\":1859,\"text\":\"I gave birth to this thick-headed baby and now he's out here\"},{\"currTime\":1863,\"text\":\"Doing dirty riddles, what's going on?\"},{\"currTime\":1865,\"text\":\"Yeah, I shouldn't have laughed at the dick jokes\"},{\"currTime\":1867,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":1868,\"text\":\"Um, but yeah, so I had a similar thing with my mom\"},{\"currTime\":1872,\"text\":\"There's the character Jamay, the schoolgirl\"},{\"currTime\":1875,\"text\":\"The first time I played her, I sent a photo to my mom going, this is what I'm doing\"},{\"currTime\":1879,\"text\":\"And she was like, what the fuck?\"},{\"currTime\":1881,\"text\":\"Like, this is wrong, because it's like, my son's dressed up as a young girl, it's really weird\"},{\"currTime\":1886,\"text\":\"And she said, her reply to me was, I won't be showing that around at work\"},{\"currTime\":1890,\"text\":\"And then, when the show came out, it was like really popular in Australia\"},{\"currTime\":1894,\"text\":\"And my mom bought a t-shirt with Jamay on it and she was walking around wearing the t-shirt with me on it\"},{\"currTime\":1899,\"text\":\"I was like, oh, you changed the tune\"},{\"currTime\":1902,\"text\":\"She's like, oh, once I saw the show\"},{\"currTime\":1904,\"text\":\"She's into it now\"},{\"currTime\":1905,\"text\":\"She is\"},{\"currTime\":1906,\"text\":\"Sorry to interrupt the episode, but I gotta let you know that if you need a snack right

myself\"},{\"currTime\":2241,\"text\":\"So, um, I can kind of walk down the street\"},{\"currTime\":2245,\"text\":\"But at the moment, because the lunatics thing's been really big\"},{\"currTime\":2249,\"text\":\"I do get stopped a lot and it's a bit full on\"},{\"currTime\":2251,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":2252,\"text\":\"It's a little bit of a like paparazzi thing

weird\"},{\"currTime\":2264,\"text\":\"But, um, it's scary when you see them and you hear the camera and stuff\"},{\"currTime\":2268,\"text\":\"It freaks me out\"},{\"currTime\":2270,\"text\":\"What does that mean?\"},{\"currTime\":2271,\"text\":\"Oh, hear the camera, people show up, yeah\"},{\"currTime\":2273,\"text\":\"Oh, yeah, the pap thing, yeah\"},{\"currTime\":2274,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":2275,\"text\":\"But, um, yeah, it's scary if I go to an event or something\"},{\"currTime\":2279,\"text\":\"And people are all hyped up and excited and you're like, shit, where, how am I going to get away from this?\"},{\"currTime\":2284,\"text\":\"Um, yeah, sometimes it just, it can be a bit full on\"},{\"currTime\":2289,\"text\":\"Yeah, it's interesting how, uh, is it been tough for you to like\"},{\"currTime\":2294,\"text\":\"Was there moments in your career where you've had to like battle your own ego?\"},{\"currTime\":2297,\"text\":\"Like one thing I noticed for myself is my ego\"},{\"currTime\":2300,\"text\":\"It's kind of a separate animal than me, you know, it lives inside of me\"},{\"currTime\":2303,\"text\":\"And it's like, it can be a victim to all the things that go on in the world\"},{\"currTime\":2307,\"text\":\"You know, you know, it's kind of like a sugar lizard, I call it\"},{\"currTime\":2310,\"text\":\"Like it'll just, you know, it just goes for the sugar all the time\"},{\"currTime\":2313,\"text\":\"It's just the way it's built\"},{\"currTime\":2315,\"text\":\"Have you had any, and recently I've had to just make sure to myself like start to do some meditation\"},{\"currTime\":2319,\"text\":\"Is just make sure to just

anything?\"},{\"currTime\":2335,\"text\":\"Um, I think like, I'm more the opposite, like I kind of can't get my head around the interest in it\"},{\"currTime\":2344,\"text\":\"And I don't know, I probably should be more confident about it\"},{\"currTime\":2348,\"text\":\"I'm just probably a bit down on myself about the whole thing\"},{\"currTime\":2352,\"text\":\"Um, yeah, if ever I, there's like TV awards nights and I go to those and like, what am I doing here?\"},{\"currTime\":2358,\"text\":\"Like, I'm not part of this, like who are these people?\"},{\"currTime\":2361,\"text\":\"I don't know, and I'm not saying that to be, I'm so super humble, whatever, it's just genuinely my thing\"},{\"currTime\":2366,\"text\":\"I'm not, yeah, I don't have that ego\"},{\"currTime\":2369,\"text\":\"Is it a discomfort?

It's crazy, isn't it?\"},{\"currTime\":2465,\"text\":\"It's the best, yeah, it's so good\"},{\"currTime\":2468,\"text\":\"Well, that's the whole drive and the reason that we're doing it\"},{\"currTime\":2472,\"text\":\"It's just to make people feel that thing\"},{\"currTime\":2476,\"text\":\"Yeah, I mean, you want them to feel a lot of things, you want them to be just excited and inspired and kind of maybe sad sometimes or all sorts of things\"},{\"currTime\":2485,\"text\":\"But the main thing you want them to do is just laugh and find it really funny\"},{\"currTime\":2489,\"text\":\"Yeah, that's cool\"},{\"currTime\":2491,\"text\":\"Yeah, it is cool, man, there's something\"},{\"currTime\":2494,\"text\":\"It's so funny laughter because people shake and they make a noise and it's such a, it's almost like you're like Harry Potter\"},{\"currTime\":2500,\"text\":\"It's not like you're Harry Potter, but the process of it is, the result of it, it's almost like it's like a magic or something, you know?\"},{\"currTime\":2508,\"text\":\"Yeah, it's very weird\"},{\"currTime\":2511,\"text\":\"I mean, you would have that immediate thing, you're standing in front of people and they're making noises and shaking their bodies at you\"},{\"currTime\":2517,\"text\":\"Yeah, that's true, you get it more immediate on stage, that's right, I forget you because you, it says online you did stand up\"},{\"currTime\":2523,\"text\":\"Yeah, I did start doing that, that's sort of how I got into it\"},{\"currTime\":2528,\"text\":\"Did you find that it wasn't your medium kind of doing it? Did you find like, because I'm sure you learned from it like, okay, this is this, but did you then find, okay, I work better in this other realm?\"},{\"currTime\":2538,\"text\":\"Yeah, I think I prefer doing TV, but that was how I got into it, that was the stepping stone because I would stand, there's nothing better than, there's no better way of reaching\"},{\"currTime\":2552,\"text\":\"Like, creating something and reaching people than stand up because you're just, you're thinking of everything, you're standing there saying it, it's reaching them immediately\"},{\"currTime\":2561,\"text\":\"Everything else has layers of stuff that takes away from that, so I found it a really good way to start things\"},{\"currTime\":2569,\"text\":\"And that's then that morphed into me doing characters on stage\"},{\"currTime\":2573,\"text\":\"I mean, I always did characters back in school days and my whole life just always did characters\"},{\"currTime\":2579,\"text\":\"But then stand up, I did the more traditional thing and then I moved into that like annoying singing songs stand up\"},{\"currTime\":2585,\"text\":\"And then I was like, actually, I'm just gonna do characters\"},{\"currTime\":2588,\"text\":\"Also, I'd get on stage and I'd talk about a person, a type of person and then I'd sort of spin around and become that person\"},{\"currTime\":2595,\"text\":\"And I was like, oh, this is the thing that's working, like, yeah\"},{\"currTime\":2599,\"text\":\"And then started to make little short films and things about those characters and then that spun me off into TV\"},{\"currTime\":2605,\"text\":\"So, yeah, I definitely did it for a little while and it was, you gotta have balls to do that though\"},{\"currTime\":2614,\"text\":\"It's like so scary just to jump up in front of people\"},{\"currTime\":2618,\"text\":\"Yeah, you get used to it, but at first\"},{\"currTime\":2621,\"text\":\"Well, I think what's scary to me is to make a character and like put it on Instagram or put it on social media or put it on that to me feels so scary for some reason\"},{\"currTime\":2630,\"text\":\"Like, there are parts of me that I think would love to do it, you know?\"},{\"currTime\":2633,\"text\":\"I want you to do it, you should do that\"},{\"currTime\":2635,\"text\":\"Yeah, I'd have to, but for some reason that is so scary to me as opposed to getting up in front of people is much less scary\"},{\"currTime\":2643,\"text\":\"Yeah, I guess it's just anything you get used to it\"},{\"currTime\":2646,\"text\":\"It's like, if you're scared of flying, you do it all the time and suddenly you're not, it's like that\"},{\"currTime\":2652,\"text\":\"Well, you know what I think it is, Chris Mann is, for me, if they're there live, then I know immediately\"},{\"currTime\":2661,\"text\":\"For me to give something to a place and let it be seen and not be able to be there and know if they're there laughing\"},{\"currTime\":2668,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":2669,\"text\":\"That for me, there's some fear in that, like, I need to be right there to know if they laugh or not\"},{\"currTime\":2674,\"text\":\"I'm okay almost if they don't, it'll hurt me, but to put it somewhere like in a television and let them see it\"},{\"currTime\":2680,\"text\":\"But not be able to actually be there and see them as they see it and know if they laugh\"},{\"currTime\":2685,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":2686,\"text\":\"That's something that's really like, to me, very uncomfortable\"},{\"currTime\":2690,\"text\":\"Yeah, okay\"},{\"currTime\":2691,\"text\":\"And that thing with TV also is it's expensive to make it, so there's a lot of expectation on it\"},{\"currTime\":2697,\"text\":\"And a lot of kind of build up and hype and people love to say that you failed at it\"},{\"currTime\":2702,\"text\":\"So there's this real, like, expectation thing\"},{\"currTime\":2705,\"text\":\"But I kind of don't get involved in that\"},{\"currTime\":2708,\"text\":\"Look, everybody knows I'm a hair boy\"},{\"currTime\":2711,\"text\":\"And if you saw me

that could happen\"},{\"currTime\":3670,\"text\":\"Was there ever like an entertainer from the states that reached out like Jim Carrey or somebody like that\"},{\"currTime\":3677,\"text\":\"That was like, oh I have to do something with this guy\"},{\"currTime\":3680,\"text\":\"I can imagine that that's probably happened to you over the years\"},{\"currTime\":3684,\"text\":\"That I've reached out to me\"},{\"currTime\":3686,\"text\":\"Yeah, and they wanted to like, they were just real keen on trying to work with you\"},{\"currTime\":3689,\"text\":\"And keen means excited, I just learned it like two days ago\"},{\"currTime\":3692,\"text\":\"But yeah, they were excited to try and have you in their project\"},{\"currTime\":3697,\"text\":\"I mean, even though it wasn't something maybe you were looking for but\"},{\"currTime\":3700,\"text\":\"Yeah, there's been a little bit of that\"},{\"currTime\":3702,\"text\":\"But sort of just more coming from like casting people with directors and stuff\"},{\"currTime\":3707,\"text\":\"Rather than actual like artists\"},{\"currTime\":3710,\"text\":\"Like a lot of them, actually that's not really like people do\"},{\"currTime\":3714,\"text\":\"There's been big big name people who are fans of the shows and have reached out\"},{\"currTime\":3718,\"text\":\"Yeah, that happens a fair

are\"},{\"currTime\":3726,\"text\":\"Yeah, I'm just asking if that's ever happened\"},{\"currTime\":3728,\"text\":\"I guess like, yeah, I guess I was just kind of thinking like\"},{\"currTime\":3732,\"text\":\"Because if I thought of like one of my favorite movies is Dumb and Dumber, right?\"},{\"currTime\":3735,\"text\":\"So I thought, well, would you ever see, you know, is that something that\"},{\"currTime\":3739,\"text\":\"Like David Spade the other day was telling me that Chris Farley\"},{\"currTime\":3745,\"text\":\"Got offered the role of, and there's something about Mary\"},{\"currTime\":3750,\"text\":\"That Ben Stiller played, the main guy\"},{\"currTime\":3753,\"text\":\"And I just never knew that, it just blew my

know\"},{\"currTime\":3761,\"text\":\"So I guess I was just wondering if there had ever been like a unique role\"},{\"currTime\":3764,\"text\":\"Or if somebody had ever, or just if it had ever happened, not like specifics, you know\"},{\"currTime\":3768,\"text\":\"That has been a few roles, it's never like the handsome lead\"},{\"currTime\":3772,\"text\":\"It's always like the kind of he,

know\"},{\"currTime\":3802,\"text\":\"Or not magic, but whatever I do have, you know\"},{\"currTime\":3804,\"text\":\"Yeah, I don't want to just put it into

yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4138,\"text\":\"To get out of the jungle a little\"},{\"currTime\":4139,\"text\":\"Alternative, like, yeah, he's a bit of an Amo

gut\"},{\"currTime\":4149,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4150,\"text\":\"His girlfriend's not that hot\"},{\"currTime\":4151,\"text\":\"Yeah, she's not that hot, dude\"},{\"currTime\":4153,\"text\":\"And she comes to the edge of the forest and like gives him books and shit\"},{\"currTime\":4156,\"text\":\"And cassette tapes, even though he's gonna have a player\"},{\"currTime\":4159,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4160,\"text\":\"She's always a bit depressed\"},{\"currTime\":4161,\"text\":\"Yeah, I could see you doing that\"},{\"currTime\":4164,\"text\":\"Let me think of some options\"},{\"currTime\":4167,\"text\":\"Do you think sometimes, like, do you know when a character comes into your head you like\"},{\"currTime\":4171,\"text\":\"Like for lunatics, you know, did you have them all planned out\"},{\"currTime\":4174,\"text\":\"And obviously you had ideas and you said once you get to set\"},{\"currTime\":4177,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4178,\"text\":\"You get in makeup, it grows even more\"},{\"currTime\":4180,\"text\":\"But was there another character that you went to set with that you guys did\"},{\"currTime\":4184,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4185,\"text\":\"That you left on the floor?\"},{\"currTime\":4186,\"text\":\"Not that we got that far with, but in the writing stage\"},{\"currTime\":4189,\"text\":\"I had like about eight characters all armed\"},{\"currTime\":4193,\"text\":\"And then I kind of had to narrow it down\"},{\"currTime\":4197,\"text\":\"I remember doing a drawing, actually, and I'm not even good at drawing stuff\"},{\"currTime\":4201,\"text\":\"It's like of all of the characters together\"},{\"currTime\":4204,\"text\":\"And so you could just look at the line up and was imagining it, how it would work\"},{\"currTime\":4208,\"text\":\"And then there was a couple of characters that I just thought, nah, you're kind of crossing out\"},{\"currTime\":4212,\"text\":\"It's like a little too similar to that, it's similar to something you've done before\"},{\"currTime\":4216,\"text\":\"That's the thing, because I've done a lot of characters now, so I have to always\"},{\"currTime\":4219,\"text\":\"Different, I've done, you know, once you do long red hair, you can't do that again\"},{\"currTime\":4223,\"text\":\"So you got to think of different hairstyles\"},{\"currTime\":4225,\"text\":\"Yeah, so a few of them I got rid of, but then are some of the great ideas\"},{\"currTime\":4230,\"text\":\"I sort of morph those ideas into the current characters\"},{\"currTime\":4233,\"text\":\"So, yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4235,\"text\":\"Yeah, it's hard to find new characters, I bet, because once you've done like a guy, if it's a gay guy, you can't\"},{\"currTime\":4239,\"text\":\"It's like you could do another one, but it's still kind of sticks on the, it'll stick to the other one\"},{\"currTime\":4243,\"text\":\"That's it, yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4245,\"text\":\"It's hard, and there's always a little bit of a crossover, because there's certain things you find funny or interesting\"},{\"currTime\":4250,\"text\":\"So you're always kind of going down the same path a little bit\"},{\"currTime\":4254,\"text\":\"Yeah, but that's actually the challenge now is to make it different, because I've done a lot of characters now\"},{\"currTime\":4262,\"text\":\"Is that kind of, I mean, even though it's like, I'm sure there's a great sense of pride with that\"},{\"currTime\":4267,\"text\":\"Is there a little bit of like, is it almost kind of a bummer sometimes that you've gone through like a lot of\"},{\"currTime\":4274,\"text\":\"Humanity and character, you know, that you have that much of a body\"},{\"currTime\":4278,\"text\":\"Yeah, it is, because sometimes you've got a slightly different take on it, and I'm like, oh fuck, that would be better\"},{\"currTime\":4282,\"text\":\"But I'm like, yeah, but you kind of did that, like you've done like the fashion thing or the skate thing, whatever it is\"},{\"currTime\":4288,\"text\":\"Surf or whatever the kind of world is\"},{\"currTime\":4291,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4292,\"text\":\"Or I've done an Asian woman before, and I'm like, I can't really do that again\"},{\"currTime\":4297,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4298,\"text\":\"But I do bring characters back, like there's been a lot of like spin-offs and stuff\"},{\"currTime\":4303,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4304,\"text\":\"Yeah, they come back\"},{\"currTime\":4305,\"text\":\"Well, I've seen, I think some of the stuff I've seen, I've seen like Jonah from Tonga and I've seen, I mean, yeah, it was just too much sometimes\"},{\"currTime\":4311,\"text\":\"Oh, but so good, and it helped me learn about like Tongan people a little bit and like the characters and it gave me like a sense of like\"},{\"currTime\":4318,\"text\":\"What it would actually be like to be at a school when you're young like that, you know\"},{\"currTime\":4322,\"text\":\"And when he goes and lives with his auntie\"},{\"currTime\":4324,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4325,\"text\":\"Oh shit, God, I fucking miss that family dude\"},{\"currTime\":4327,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4328,\"text\":\"I miss the fam, I miss the fucking auntie, man\"},{\"currTime\":4330,\"text\":\"It feels so real, like it feels like that, that they exist out there somewhere still\"},{\"currTime\":4335,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4336,\"text\":\"Does it feel like that to you too?\"},{\"currTime\":4337,\"text\":\"Yeah, to me it does, yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4339,\"text\":\"It's, yeah, and it's kind of, yeah, I'm kind of caught up in the illusion of it as well\"},{\"currTime\":4345,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4346,\"text\":\"Weirdly\"},{\"currTime\":4347,\"text\":\"Yeah, I can totally, I can totally imagine that\"},{\"currTime\":4352,\"text\":\"You know, a lot of kids these days their imagination is changing because, you know, with social media, with computers and stuff, it's different\"},{\"currTime\":4358,\"text\":\"Like you can create stuff actually more\"},{\"currTime\":4362,\"text\":\"So your imagination is almost like the processor now is in the machine\"},{\"currTime\":4367,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4368,\"text\":\"And whether then it used to be, you have to be in your head, you know\"},{\"currTime\":4371,\"text\":\"It's a little bit scary, I wonder if they'll ever have, you know, if they'll ever be able to do some of the stuff that, you know\"},{\"currTime\":4378,\"text\":\"You and I have been able to do growing up, like if the medium will change so much that they won't even\"},{\"currTime\":4384,\"text\":\"Like, why is this guy pretending to be this character when he could just, you know\"},{\"currTime\":4388,\"text\":\"Yeah, you're right\"},{\"currTime\":4391,\"text\":\"That's weird, isn't it?\"},{\"currTime\":4393,\"text\":\"It's already kind of evolved a lot in the last 10 years or so, so, yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4398,\"text\":\"Does it scare you a little bit?\"},{\"currTime\":4400,\"text\":\"No, I just kind of roll with it, like, it's funny doing the show with Netflix because they have this sort of, the episodic thing\"},{\"currTime\":4410,\"text\":\"But all the apps kind of run together for most people, most people sit back and watch like one and a half episodes or something\"},{\"currTime\":4416,\"text\":\"And then the episode length time, so we're sort of, they're basing it on the model of old broadcast TV\"},{\"currTime\":4423,\"text\":\"But it's actually already evolving into this thing, it's just this linear entertainment thing that people just tap into when they want to\"},{\"currTime\":4432,\"text\":\"And, yeah, we're sort of in this weird transition where it's a little bit, there's a little bit left over from the past\"},{\"currTime\":4441,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4442,\"text\":\"And kind of like, yeah, like when films first started and it was like Vaudeville performers and shit and they were like\"},{\"currTime\":4450,\"text\":\"It was all just like watching a theatrical production, like you were kind of looking at it from one perspective\"},{\"currTime\":4456,\"text\":\"And then it kind of evolved and people were like, well, shit, we could get different angles and we could edit this\"},{\"currTime\":4461,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4462,\"text\":\"Anyway, I don't know why I'm standing like, I know what I'm talking about\"},{\"currTime\":4465,\"text\":\"You just seen it's changed\"},{\"currTime\":4466,\"text\":\"Yeah, it's evolving and so I started doing 25 minute episodes or whatever\"},{\"currTime\":4471,\"text\":\"And they went to air once a week and now I'm doing this kind of long thing that just keeps flowing together\"},{\"currTime\":4478,\"text\":\"And yeah, it's cool\"},{\"currTime\":4479,\"text\":\"Has it been cool? Has it been, was it as cool of an experience doing lunatics as anything else?\"},{\"currTime\":4484,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4486,\"text\":\"Well, cool and better in the way that it reached people because normally I have to like launch it in different countries\"},{\"currTime\":4492,\"text\":\"And you're kind of dealing with different networks where this was just like, they just press the button and suddenly it's all over the world\"},{\"currTime\":4497,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4498,\"text\":\"It's a big audience\"},{\"currTime\":4500,\"text\":\"So, but making the show was pretty much the same experience, I guess, as all of them because, yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4509,\"text\":\"It's so crazy, there are moments where I'll look at you and I'll see like just another character will pop into my head that it's like I forgot about a little bit\"},{\"currTime\":4516,\"text\":\"Oh, really?\"},{\"currTime\":4517,\"text\":\"You know, even from the past, yeah, there'll be like an angle where it's like, oh, there's a Mr. G, you know?\"},{\"currTime\":4521,\"text\":\"Or be like an angle and then be like, oh, that's fucking, you know, oh, I see how he's built, that's how Jonah was built, you know?\"},{\"currTime\":4527,\"text\":\"Like, just like the way your arm is bent, it's just kind of bizarre, man, you know?\"},{\"currTime\":4531,\"text\":\"Yeah, it is really cool\"},{\"currTime\":4533,\"text\":\"I don't see myself, I guess, I don't really get that experience unless I'm looking in the mirror or something, but\"},{\"currTime\":4540,\"text\":\"Yeah, I can imagine, that must be weird. People often do try to say who they think I'm the most like\"},{\"currTime\":4546,\"text\":\"They do say that quite a lot\"},{\"currTime\":4548,\"text\":\"But that must change though, because then suddenly there are moments where I'm like, oh, he definitely seems like Gavin a little bit more, you know?\"},{\"currTime\":4554,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4555,\"text\":\"The Earl of, what is it called?\"},{\"currTime\":4557,\"text\":\"Gaius, yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4559,\"text\":\"Gaius, what a fucking great name\"},{\"currTime\":4564,\"text\":\"Chris Lilly, man, thank you so much\"},{\"currTime\":4566,\"text\":\"I don't think there's anything else really, I mean, we can kind of chill and wrap it up, is that okay with you?\"},{\"currTime\":4571,\"text\":\"Yeah, that sounds good, it's been really fun\"},{\"currTime\":4573,\"text\":\"Has it been?\"},{\"currTime\":4574,\"text\":\"Yeah, I didn't know what to expect, but it's been so relaxed and you're very easy to talk to\"},{\"currTime\":4579,\"text\":\"Well, thanks, man, I appreciate it, yeah, I wanted this to be just a, I mean, I think this would be a great episode, man\"},{\"currTime\":4583,\"text\":\"Our listeners are going to absolutely be over the moon just to have, to be able to have like just an experience with you\"},{\"currTime\":4588,\"text\":\"Just as a regular person, you know?\"},{\"currTime\":4591,\"text\":\"Yeah, it's just inspiring, man, it's inspiring to see like, because there's nothing else out there like you\"},{\"currTime\":4596,\"text\":\"So people need to see it and young people need to see it so they can be reminded, oh, I can do that, you know?\"},{\"currTime\":4602,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4603,\"text\":\"Because that's how I learned about stuff, watch it, I would see in living color and like Damon Wayans and stuff\"},{\"currTime\":4607,\"text\":\"I'd be like, oh, I can do that, that's a thing?\"},{\"currTime\":4609,\"text\":\"Yeah\"},{\"currTime\":4610,\"text\":\"Wow, now I'm going to do that, you know?\"},{\"currTime\":4612,\"text\":\"Yeah, I get kids' enemy videos all the time of characters, like they, it does inspire kids\"},{\"currTime\":4616,\"text\":\"Oh, that's great\"},{\"currTime\":4617,\"text\":\"Yeah, it's fun\"},{\"currTime\":4618,\"text\":\"That would be great\"},{\"currTime\":4619,\"text\":\"Do you plan to, will you make more stuff in the future?

Chris Lily. Yeah, dude, I actually had a dream dude Like a couple nights ago that you were We're at like a restaurant or something. It was like a fast dream and you were having like a maybe like a salad or something I don't know. Is that something you would eat? Well, what do you think you would even eat you think? Well, I don't I don't eat mate, but yeah, oh, so you maybe within salad eight. Oh, I don't know what I ate Yeah, Mexican Mexican food. So maybe yeah, maybe it wasn't I think it was you it was pretty much you because I remember I was meeting you at this restaurant And because I was excited about meeting you and so I was meeting you at this restaurant Yeah, and then it kind of cut to Yeah, it looked like you were having like a salad or something Yeah, I wonder what made you think that did I look like because you don't know what I really look like you would be thinking of the characters and stuff. So yeah, some of them. I mean Yeah, I'm trying to think of what character maybe we'd be having like a salad maybe Not all the Earl of Havenhurst that not that guy I He's gonna salad eight on He's a chaser. Yeah, and what's wrong with him? I feel like he's on the spectrum. Yeah, some sort the Tizm That's what they call it where I'm from other Tizm. Yeah, there's something going on Yeah, I don't know. He's like kind of a victim of like society a little bit you think well Does he do his own thing or is he like a Yeah, I mean, I feel like he's like Aspirational it's like everyone wishes they had the balls to do the stuff that he does and say the stuff he does Yeah, but I think he gets away with it because he's a little bit unaware of how impactful it is Which yeah, maybe that's the spectrum thing. Yeah, it's kind of a blessing to to be a little bit unaware Yeah, once you get too aware stuff's not that fun a lot of times Yeah, I think I think people want to bet him. That's why it kind of works. Yeah. Oh Yeah, I do a little bit. I think I was I wish I was a bit more like him Just feel us. Huh? Yeah, and his little cousin too. What's a guy's name Dylan? Yeah How great was it to work with that kid? He's a cool kid. Yeah, he just kept laughing at me You could see some scenes Where it cuts away from him, I noticed because he's just gonna start laughing Yeah, it was well because we just keep rolling. I think he didn't quite know when we were on or not Yes, but he's a really great kid But he picked up on a lot of the language and he started like ad-libbing and throwing in like oh, that's great See words and stuff. So had to kind of pull him back a bit. Oh, he's starting to get crazy, huh? Yeah, but Yeah, he was just having fun That's great. There was a it must be fun to see that as like a and we're talking about lunatics for people that haven't checked it out It must be great to see like in the beginning a guy like Dylan an actor like him kind of you know Learning his way, but by the end him starting to get that confidence and stuff. Is that pretty cool to see as a director? Yeah, I was unreal There's a lot of scenes where we drive off in this little Yeah, and I had to like pull out the audio because as we drove off he was like fuck slow down Yeah, I can't like swear Swearing at me and just like he was just he got into it so much. That's crazy Yeah, I wanted him to be a bit more mute. So yeah, pull him out pull the audio out You had to take him aside sometimes a little a little bit But I just usually these people that we cast you kind of just roll with whatever you've you've got like you've You've chosen them for a reason and you just make the best of what they have rather than trying to shape them too much Yeah, and do you do or most of your casting as well? Yeah, well, I choose all the people that I'm I have a really great team of casting people that find them They literally got find them off the street They walk around the streets and find them or they'll just like rock up to schools or whatever It's they'll go anywhere Yeah, because it's so specific the kind of people we need that you have to like search far and wide Yeah, it must be that it seems like you almost need Like kind of a garden you set up a garden and you're kind of the the rabbit in a way so it's like every the other people are still amazing people and humans and everything but it's almost Does that make any sense to you? It's almost like you have to have a place to put where your Creativity just is it be able to kind of flow through the yeah the the slalom poles of the other characters Yeah, that's it. That's exactly it And it takes a while to find those people also you don't because they're real people I mean not all of them some of them have some acting experience, but a lot of them are real people and They're they behave a certain way in the audition and then when you're on set it's kind of like oh shit There's Chris Lee. Oh, he's in a wig. He's wearing at me and they kind of become a bit different So you kind of have to adapt to the new version of them. Mmm Because you can't talk them back into the regular versions sometimes it's kind of hard, I guess I try to a little bit, but then it makes them lose confidence. So Sometimes I'm like I'll fix it in the edit But I mean they do that the great thing about that is then you get these magic moments where they just They do these things that actors never do like any like shit. That's so real and good and Yeah, is it hard for you sometimes when you know a moment like that is because I can imagine they're probably Times were in a scene. You know a moment just happened. That was so perfect that it's like Is it hard sometimes to You're you able to notice those as they happen kind of sometimes? Yeah, you're in it you Yeah, you see it when it happens. Yeah, and then a part of me is also like watching the cameras And I've told those guys what to do while they're doing things I can see the way the cameras are moving at the same time like oh shit They covered it awesome. Got that. Yeah, like because we have two cameras rolling at the same time and Yeah, it's a weird thing and I can sort of I'm editing it in my head as I'm doing the scene I don't know. I'm not trying to make myself sound. No, it doesn't sound like you're I'm just like it's a weird process And you're like, oh shit, that's gonna work. Yeah, cool. I only covered that and then I'll cut there. It's that's exciting Well, there's not a lot of people that do that have ever done really kind of what you what you do, you know, it's rare It's extremely rare. I think man like I Don't know. I mean Ari and I were talking about yesterday that does like You know in the US we have who's that guy Ari? Yeah, a little bit of Sasha Baron Cohen, but his some of his stuff is a little more mean-spirited I think where Yours is just kind of like this World that is just so It's all about fun. It seems like a lot of times Is that the vibe on set or does it get sometimes a little bit? Too mad like you have to manage so much that it's hard to stay in the fun stuff It's probably more it's a little bit more serious, but it's pretty relaxed and kind of peaceful. It's it's a really quiet Thoughtful kind of set like it's not Yeah, that's not people aren't like often you have like a first first AD that We'll be yelling at everyone, but in our world. It's just very peaceful and he talks quietly and It's just about getting those moments because I've thought it through so much before we get on set Mm-hmm that I just know I need these little moments. So It's not like everyone's laughing their heads off the whole time. Yeah, you kind of know like you sort of You know how it's gonna come together Yeah, it's it's more like peaceful than hilarious on set. Yeah do um Do you feel like Like recently I was thinking about like what makes Like why laughter is like important to me kind of you know or what like it's always been to me in my life like and sometimes I was thinking that You know, I feel like laughter. It's like It was like when people were laughing when I was young It was like the only time that I kind of felt okay like for some reason in my head I was always kind of judging myself or I thought other people thought something was wrong with me You know and so I knew if they were laughing then they couldn't be like Not liking me at the same time or something, you know, like if I have those people laughing There's no way they could be laughing, you know See seeing their smile and hearing the joy come out of them and also not liking me So it was like a second of like peace in my in my head or in my spirit or something Do you what it what is laughter kind of been like for you or the or the ability to make people laugh like what's something? Do you have any thoughts on any of that from your own experience in life? Yeah? I mean, it's so it's everything like I every friendship I have it's a bit about laughing and making jokes about things and just yeah I'm not really friends with serious people. So it's like it's everything. It's like so fun to just Even friends that I just text. It's just all jokes like and it's not like we're like, you know, it's yeah Everything's funny. It's just about seeing the funny side of everything Yeah, similar thing like growing up. I just knew that there was a sort of power in the idea of making the family laugh and I think I feel like you're the youngest as well as something like are you the youngest I have a older brother Yeah, so I'm the youngest. I've got two two older brothers and sister. So I remember going a little one then. Yeah And so when I was like usually the drug addict is a little one. Oh, yeah. Well, there's time for that There's time for that. Um, but it's yeah, I remember just being like five and then my brother and sister were actually born in the same year Same year January December. But anyway, they were like I thought you meant like May and July. No, um, still it's like that's close. Um, and I think they call it Irish twins Yeah Well, I was supposed to be triplets to someone told me once Yeah, and I wasn't it's just me which is crazy because I've always felt like there was something else out there for me, you know How did they do an ultrasound? The doctor said that Were the other ones in there at one point? I don't know told my mom that it was triplets whenever they were going in there and then nothing just me Can you have two that don't make it and one comes out? My mom would have told me I've always secretly thought I was a twin and that my mom is keeping it a secret and I like hit her up with that a couple of years ago And she had a like a flinch on if she sort of reacted when I said it So you think maybe it could be something There could be something there's yeah, but I don't know if that's possible. I don't know much about babies Well, mom's like to keep secrets. I think when it comes to stuff like that, like about birth and like, you know, family history and stuff I think they don't like to share all of that Yeah, I guess it's in there die. It was more of a you just went off and did it and didn't talk about it Yeah, they used to sometimes they'd take a car down to you know, maybe Byron Bay or something, you know And just have a baby down there and come back and never even have a baby Yeah, just back always, you know, kind of fat for a bit Yeah, just into the toilet or whatever Yeah, that's it But I mean, yeah people back in the day you drive off to another town Boston and give the kid to a charity or something Come back, you know, it was this true. Yeah, I wasn't a long ago. I was like that 50 years maybe Yeah The only thing my mom said once because I talked I was talking about how this circumference of my head is really big I was like, I've got a massive head and I have to get extra large hats and she's like and she was like Yeah, I remember So apparently it was a big head when it came out Oh, I bet that never leaves him either Yeah, I don't think about that The pain of that. Yeah, that's true man And is your mom still alive? Yeah Oh good, yeah, let's think about it later when she's not Yeah, she brought it up Oh, well then you're safe man So you had the two older, yeah, the two older siblings Um, yeah, although I was gonna say like they were like kind of pre No, they would have been like teenagers when I was about five and they're kind of stressing out The parents are stressing out about them because they're the eldest and they have to like There was a kind of stressy vibe going on And I remember just doing stupid gags and making the family laugh Which mostly involved me like getting my dick out Yeah That's a huge thing Yeah, that was big when I was about five So there's a lot of dick jokes going on And I bet it was fun for them too to see a kid just partying with his dick out and not like in an illegal way You know, just a... Yeah, it was fun Yeah man, actually when I was born I had like an adult sized penis on a child's body Did you? Yeah, and so they had like I couldn't even sleep at night, it would hurt my back You know, to sleep because I'd lay on it You know, babies lay face down Did you just grow into it or has it grown like before? No, I grew into it I grew past it actually Oh, right And that was kind of disappointing Oh, I see now Yeah, okay, now it's a child size Yeah, now it's well, it's I mean it's you know, like a healthy kind of teenager size, you know Oh, yeah I think, I think I haven't shown it to any anybody I haven't seen a lot of teenagers dicks, but I can imagine Yeah You think... I guess at five years old your dick is like your greatest wet, it's like the coolest thing you've ever known It's the best thing out of it Yeah How great is that? Four times a day It's so fun Yeah It's still fun, it's like, yeah And people laugh at it, my family thought it was hilarious Yeah Oh, yeah, that's great Yeah There's a lot of photos of it Oh, that's crazy Do you, I remember it, sometimes I'll be honest, I would lay in the water in the bathtub, right? And just pee straight up in the air onto myself Yeah, same Oh, that's really good It was good, man I just saw, oh, you know what? I just saw the scene last night I was up watching Lunatics of the one Where the, your character, the large buddy realistic guy when he urinates his mouth Yeah, yeah, he loves that When he's showing the girl Paige, when she's sitting down He thinks it's amazing Yeah And it is Like It was good, man, it was exciting But yeah, I remember being, it was so much fun when you were young, man Yeah, making the family laugh, that is definitely a thing And then you just become a big version of that, I guess Yeah Yeah Did you, did you realize like, because I remember when I was young I would make kids at school laugh, you know But I never realized that it would be able to translate into doing it like on a stage and stuff, you know In a bigger environment Yeah Did that kind of happen for you? Like, was there a part where you realized like Because it's kind of scary to think that one of your talents, something you do Could be like a marketable talent, it's almost like a Yeah It's almost cheesy, yeah, it ruins it a little bit, it's like Yeah But then you're like, I can have a normal job or I can do this cool thing and Yeah Yeah, it's sort of worth it Do you know like a lot of your characters have they been with you since you were young Or some of them are brand new, some of them are things you just see off of people on the street And you're like, oh, I could do that guy Yeah, it's usually a combination of like things that, of ideas that you collect over a really long period So it's not like it's ever one person or one thing you've seen Sometimes it's like a leftover concept from another show And that's the kind of start of something But then it just evolves along the way It's sort of out of, I feel like it's out of my control as well Like it kind of, without trying to like stand in like a way and go It sort of, it comes alive and I don't really have that much control of it It's like, you put the things in place, you know what they're going to look like And there's the story, but the way they kind of move and the way they sound And everything, it just comes together literally on the first day when we're on set Because I had an idea for all the hair and stuff But then the hair guy was like, well, why don't you try this? And it kind of evolved really differently But you don't get to see all the elements together until literally like boom on the first day Like that Quentin character, the first thing we filmed was around the pool when he's having his 30th party And I didn't really know what he was going to sound like Like I kind of, I knew the character, I knew what he was about But he really just came alive in that moment Like around the pool with his mates and they're all going out And yeah, I was like, okay, this is who he is But sometimes people don't get that and they often say to me, I really like the voice Or like, I just love how she moves or something I'm like, how am I moving? I didn't, I haven't noticed it Oh, I see, like those things weren't even part of the plan No, I haven't practiced, I'm not, I don't stand in front of a mirror doing this kind of thing It just, it really just comes alive on the day It sounds strange, but it's It doesn't sound that strange to me, I can understand a little bit Yeah, well, I've thought about it a lot and I know what the story is and I know what they're going to say And the scripted lines and everything, but it, the combo of everything comes together on the day, yeah Like that, the Gavin character, he was sitting on his bed back at the Adelaide house And started talking, but I was like, this is kind of how kids talk, I think And it was really slow and I was like, it didn't have the rhythm of something that should be funny But I was like, I think it's better to just make it real, like make it exactly how I think 12 year old boys talk And that'll ultimately be funnier than trying to be kind of quirky and have that funny rhythm that people usually do Yeah, because some of that I'm noticing in some of that it's like, there's something like going for the joke And then there's something like, I trust that this will be funny later and I just have to let it, yeah Like sometimes there's a moment I notice in myself where it's like, there's a little thing that goes on my head It's like, if I don't say anything else or make another sound or another movement right here, then this is going to land really, really good But if I do anything else, if I look or move or anything or say one more word, it pops the balloon So I can imagine there's some unique moments where you're doing those characters where you probably really land in like a special spot You're like, oh, this is a good spot for this character right now Yeah And so cool, man, because it's just such a, because then the reward is all for the audience The reward is all, you know, they're going to love it, you know It's so cool, man The hard thing is you have to really block out trying to impress the people around you, like the crew and the cast If the moment's awkward and not funny, it's okay because it'll come together later But yeah, it's sometimes you have to really remember it's not about pleasing the people around you, it's about the end result Yeah So you get over that and just, yeah No, it's interesting, man, it's a... Yeah, because then it's interesting because part of which, or what I always noticed with my original thing was to make the people around me laugh Yeah So it's then whenever you're taping something, sometimes you have to sacrifice that Yeah To know that it's going to make, it's going to play better in this other way Yeah, I think when you were saying making this kid's laugh at school I used to do that, but in a more kind of thought out, planned way Like I wasn't the class clown, the loud kid, but I would plan out a thing like a funny scripted thing that I was going to just do If I had to do a speech, I would write out something really funny and then I just get up and do something kind of shockingly funny Rather than I wasn't the kid yelling shit out from up the back Yeah In primary school days, I remember like you had to, I don't know, drawings and stuff, I'd always do something really funny that incorporated like some in-joke about the teacher or something But it was planned out, it wasn't sort of the loud funny guy thing Yeah Which seems to be what I like to do Yeah, I was never the class clown, I was never like a physical, I was never physical, I was always like in my head, I was like, oh this would be a time, I was a verbal I was more verbal than I was physical Yeah, I still wanted the people around me to laugh, like I loved it that you get up and do the speech and they laugh, it was so fun Do you remember sometimes the fact that they would even continue to let you go back up to the front of the class after you'd already been funny other times? Yeah And ruin the teacher's day and she's again going to let you go up and do anything Yeah The teachers just secretly they're like kind of bored and wondering what they're doing with their lives and they're like, hang on, this is gonna, this will be like a little wrong but it'll entertain me Yeah Sometimes there was no like educational kind of content in what I was saying but the teachers would give me full marks, they'd be like, you made my day And you just, yeah it's awesome I started to work out that if you actually pretended to be the teachers so I'd get up and do like speeches as them and um They would get keen to it Or some other kind of controversial teacher at the school and it was like, it can't leave the classroom but I said this Yeah That was fun That's fun man, it was so fun being young like that just to be free, you know Yeah, it was good Yeah And there was no, it didn't have to lead to anything, it was just that moment of being funny and then you'd be thinking about that forever Yeah and then reenacting with your friends or talking about how funny it was, that was so much better, now it's all captured So it kind of, it spoils it some Yeah and it gets judged for weird reasons and analyzed too much I guess Yeah Well that's one of the cool things that's been about podcasts, it's like all, that shit is dying in the US like all of that like Because there was no fan base for it, it was just like clickbait online, you know, there was no real, you know, people judging stuff, it was just Losers sitting around at home with not just on their computers and people, lonely people writing articles, it wasn't actual funny people who like to laugh Expressing themselves because they're busy, living their lives Yeah But now it's like, with podcasting so many more people are just having a good time again And so much less judgmental, in the US anyway, I'm noticing it growing But I don't know if it's the same here probably Yeah I guess it would be, it seems to be getting really huge the whole podcasting and I can see why Yeah, it's uncensored and you really feel like you get to know the person you're listening to Yeah I think it's good Did you, so when you made your family laugh when you were young, did you make like your mother and father laugh too or no? Yeah, yeah, they were the main ones laughing Oh really? Yeah That's cool Was it fun to make your parents laugh? Like who was the funnest to make laugh in your family? Probably my oldest brother, yeah And I mean he would make me laugh, like so we had a kind of, and still does, like we had a good thing together Yeah One of my favorite things that he did when I was little was, I used to go to bed really early and he was a teenager so he would stay up But it was really dark and he used to sneak in my room and like jump on my bed and pretend that he was my Chinese mother And did this like ridiculous stereotypical accent But the whole concept was that the Chinese mother used to sneak in at night to try to steal me back Because I was actually a Chinese kid that had had an operation to make my eyes wide And then he'd do the whole like, I can't do the accent, I'll get in trouble, but Here, I'll do it, let me try, okay? Oh, you're coming home! There it is Yeah, this is your Chinese mother Anyway, he used to do that and then he'd run out of the room and then he'd come back in as himself And he'd be like, oh Chris, there was this Chinese woman running down the driveway, she seemed really freaked out And I'd have to pretend I didn't know anything about it And it used to make me laugh so much He did a lot of those, but my Chinese mother was one of my favorites That's so cool that he did that because then it leaves you, because then he goes to bed or whatever And it leaves you in your bed laying there with this expansive idea of what can be funny There's a woman out in the world that's a fake woman There's your brother who's just asleep in the other room, there's you laying there with your eyes and your spirit wide open It was so exciting I'm still thrilled by it I mean, that's an example of him being hilarious to me So I think it kind of got me excited about those ideas Do you think that humor creates a special bond between family members and stuff like that? Yeah, definitely I kind of imagine people that don't find things funny That's my whole relationship with the family is everything's a joke I messaged my mom like every day and it's always something funny Yeah, I mean there's lots of in-jokes and sort of funny stories But yeah, it definitely bonds people together Do you guys, does your family have a good regular connection as well? And then you also have the humor connection? Or is the humor connection kind of like a... Does it kind of suffice for you guys is the way you guys kind of emotionally connect to each other If that's something that's a bizarre question or not Yeah, I think, yeah, it's not two things It's like we talk about regular stuff but it always has a bit of a funny take And it's that kind of piss-take Australian humor thing where you're kind of like putting someone down Yeah Yeah, my mom's thing is about how she's to say we're all thick, like not very smart And so that's her whole thing is that she, in the family, she's the one that had the thick kids Especially after hearing about how thick your head was Oh, yeah She should have known out of the gate this one's going to be a bit thicker than most Yeah, so she still runs with that angle that like we're really stupid She's not wrong She must be really proud of you, huh? Yeah, I think she's really into it Yeah, she's... She, yeah, really appreciates it and I think so We don't really talk about it in that way so much Yeah She's always telling me people that she works with and friends and stuff that are loving it So I think she's into it That's cool, that must be, yeah, for a mom that's pretty cool Yeah, my mom said she wore a t-shirt on mine Because my mom first came to Sony, she hadn't seen me performing about five years until a couple of weeks ago And she, um... I gave her just like a merch t-shirt, you know She was just enamored by She talks about it every day now And it's got your head on it It's pretty lame, but she likes it, you know Yeah And she wore it somewhere and some young guy came up and said something to her And, uh... Yeah, it's just like the most... Yeah, there's something for me anyway about making my mom feel proud that really just like Makes me feel okay, you know Makes me feel like a different level of okay than I'm normally able to make on my own, you know Because the kind of thing we do, it takes a while to get to the level where it's like your job and it's perceived as a successful thing So there's many years where I'm sure parents are like, what the fuck am I doing? Like, I fucked this up Yeah, what am I doing? I gave birth to this thick-headed baby and now he's out here Doing dirty riddles, what's going on? Yeah, I shouldn't have laughed at the dick jokes Yeah Um, but yeah, so I had a similar thing with my mom There's the character Jamay, the schoolgirl The first time I played her, I sent a photo to my mom going, this is what I'm doing And she was like, what the fuck? Like, this is wrong, because it's like, my son's dressed up as a young girl, it's really weird And she said, her reply to me was, I won't be showing that around at work And then, when the show came out, it was like really popular in Australia And my mom bought a t-shirt with Jamay on it and she was walking around wearing the t-shirt with me on it I was like, oh, you changed the tune She's like, oh, once I saw the show She's into it now She is Sorry to interrupt the episode, but I gotta let you know that if you need a snack right now Maybe some taquitos or maybe an ice cream, you know, or a tiramisu Anytime, anywhere, even Ibuprofen at 10am, you can postmate it Postmates is your personal delivery service, grocery delivery, whatever kind of delivery service All year round, anything you're craving, Postmates can deliver You know, they're the largest on-demand network in the U.S. And they offer delivery from all the restaurants, grocery and convenience stores And traditional retailers, you could possibly want or need, that's everything Think of something, do you want it?

Somebody said, hey man, you have to watch this And then I heard it again like a week later from somebody just randomly And then I was like, okay, this thing's coming into my little universe And I gotta know about it And it, oh dude Cause that show, I made that in Australia for our local network And I just never thought it would go beyond Australia Really? The fact that you're watching it in America a year ago, it spins me out Like, that I could imagine I could imagine that a decade later or something if you have something that's still swirling And even blowing people's minds, it blew my mind It was like, I never seen anything like this since I was a kid And they had a show called In Living Color when I was young That was really big in the States But yeah, to this day I think it's probably the funniest You know, and going off into that series, you know, with Mr. G and the other character Like, Jenner from Tongue Just looking at my dick, just the whole, just so many fucking It's everything that I felt like was funny to me as a human, you know And I couldn't express it And so somebody had captured this ability to just make it perfect, man Yeah, somebody will just really get it Yeah Does it make you laugh? I mean, I never go back and watch anything that I really do have done But does it make you laugh sometimes? Sometimes a character, like, the voice of one of them will pop in your head Yeah It makes you feel good Definitely, like, because if you have a look at Instagram And people make all these memes and little videos And the thing is, I forget that I've done stuff But I relive it through those videos and things Someone sent me a Jermay one the other day And I was like, shit, that's funny I was losing my shit a bit Yeah, it was just Jermay having to go at the principle for not giving her the Hilford Medal I don't know if you've seen that show, but yeah So her whole thing is that they've given it to a fat lesbian border And she's really, like, can't believe And she says, yeah, I'm, like, the hottest student to ever grace your fucking playground And I don't know, just for some reason that line made me laugh But yeah, I do laugh at it I love it Yeah I don't, yeah, some of the old stuff It's not like you sit around and laugh at it, not in an ego way But that's, I mean, that's just a testament to how entertaining it is I think that it can even come back and make you laugh, you know Yeah And that's okay It's, you know, it's cool Sometimes there'll be a moment I'll see in a joke I'll, you know, I'll see online or something And I'll be like, dude, that got me, man That guy did a good job It's not like I'm thinking I did a good job Yeah It's kind of like I'm thinking that guy did a good job That's a good way to explain it Yeah, I feel like I'm not responsible for that So yeah, I'm not bragging when I say that It's like, oh, that person was funny Yeah, it's hard to keep our ego out It's, uh, are you, are you mind cutting on the AC for a second? Or just cutting it on over there? It's on that wall Just put it at like 19, yeah, if you don't mind, bud Oh, and always the open or two, he's a, he's a, well, that's what he is He's a comedian, but he's like the best, yeah He's been, uh Are you guys on tonight? A real champ, yeah If you want to jump on stage, man, you and me You want to welcome to practice something Oh, what? People would lose their minds though, huh? Is it hard being like a legend in your country? Must be, is it kind of scary sometimes a little bit? It is a little bit, but I'm pretty low key and I don't do any press and stuff So I'm not kind of known as like me as myself So, um, I can kind of walk down the street But at the moment, because the lunatics thing's been really big I do get stopped a lot and it's a bit full on Yeah It's a little bit of a like paparazzi thing that happens here, which can be a bit, it's just scary It's just scares me It's scary Like I, you know, I don't care The fact it's just me walking around the streets and stuff But the photos are not that weird But, um, it's scary when you see them and you hear the camera and stuff It freaks me out What does that mean? Oh, hear the camera, people show up, yeah Oh, yeah, the pap thing, yeah Yeah But, um, yeah, it's scary if I go to an event or something And people are all hyped up and excited and you're like, shit, where, how am I going to get away from this? Um, yeah, sometimes it just, it can be a bit full on Yeah, it's interesting how, uh, is it been tough for you to like Was there moments in your career where you've had to like battle your own ego? Like one thing I noticed for myself is my ego It's kind of a separate animal than me, you know, it lives inside of me And it's like, it can be a victim to all the things that go on in the world You know, you know, it's kind of like a sugar lizard, I call it Like it'll just, you know, it just goes for the sugar all the time It's just the way it's built Have you had any, and recently I've had to just make sure to myself like start to do some meditation Is just make sure to just keep my mind and focus on what's going on My job is just to make people laugh and not get caught up in anybody else's ideas of what I am Um, do you have any, do you have any thoughts about that during your career Or notice any stuff about your own ego or anything? Um, I think like, I'm more the opposite, like I kind of can't get my head around the interest in it And I don't know, I probably should be more confident about it I'm just probably a bit down on myself about the whole thing Um, yeah, if ever I, there's like TV awards nights and I go to those and like, what am I doing here? Like, I'm not part of this, like who are these people? I don't know, and I'm not saying that to be, I'm so super humble, whatever, it's just genuinely my thing I'm not, yeah, I don't have that ego Is it a discomfort? So say you're at a thing like that, right? Because if I go to something like that in Los Angeles, I feel uncomfortable Oh yeah Like I feel like, yeah, I don't know, I feel like maybe these people are judging me Or I just feel some sort of uncomfortable, which is kind of fine with me It's kind of, some of the uncomfort is what keeps me in a place where I feel like I'm able to be funny anyway Um, is that the kind of thing you feel or you just feel like, oh, this isn't my vibe or do you, like if you go to something kind of fancy, is there? Yeah, I think because there's, I feel like there's an expectation for me to be a little piece of the show So I feel like when I'm at those things, people like, can you make us feel the way that we do when we watch you dressed up in the show? And I'm like, that's, that's not what I do But like, I knew that you would get it, that's why I like talking to you, but normally I don't do those kind of interviews and things Or go on TV talk shows and stuff because I know that there'll be that expectation I see what you're saying Yeah, well, I'm so grateful that you, that we're able to do this, man Yeah, I just couldn't believe I could be such a fan of something, I've never been a fan of anything that much in my whole life It's almost bizarre, dude I was like, man, I'm such a, like what's going on with me, dude? I thought I was going to go through like a second puberty or something, you know? I thought I was going to sprout another dick or something, you know, or another beard or something on my neck You know, I thought it was pretty cool, you just, yeah, it just made me laugh so much, man Oh, good, that's like the best thing ever, like to know that Isn't it fun making people laugh? It's crazy, isn't it? It's the best, yeah, it's so good Well, that's the whole drive and the reason that we're doing it It's just to make people feel that thing Yeah, I mean, you want them to feel a lot of things, you want them to be just excited and inspired and kind of maybe sad sometimes or all sorts of things But the main thing you want them to do is just laugh and find it really funny Yeah, that's cool Yeah, it is cool, man, there's something It's so funny laughter because people shake and they make a noise and it's such a, it's almost like you're like Harry Potter It's not like you're Harry Potter, but the process of it is, the result of it, it's almost like it's like a magic or something, you know? Yeah, it's very weird I mean, you would have that immediate thing, you're standing in front of people and they're making noises and shaking their bodies at you Yeah, that's true, you get it more immediate on stage, that's right, I forget you because you, it says online you did stand up Yeah, I did start doing that, that's sort of how I got into it Did you find that it wasn't your medium kind of doing it? Did you find like, because I'm sure you learned from it like, okay, this is this, but did you then find, okay, I work better in this other realm? Yeah, I think I prefer doing TV, but that was how I got into it, that was the stepping stone because I would stand, there's nothing better than, there's no better way of reaching Like, creating something and reaching people than stand up because you're just, you're thinking of everything, you're standing there saying it, it's reaching them immediately Everything else has layers of stuff that takes away from that, so I found it a really good way to start things And that's then that morphed into me doing characters on stage I mean, I always did characters back in school days and my whole life just always did characters But then stand up, I did the more traditional thing and then I moved into that like annoying singing songs stand up And then I was like, actually, I'm just gonna do characters Also, I'd get on stage and I'd talk about a person, a type of person and then I'd sort of spin around and become that person And I was like, oh, this is the thing that's working, like, yeah And then started to make little short films and things about those characters and then that spun me off into TV So, yeah, I definitely did it for a little while and it was, you gotta have balls to do that though It's like so scary just to jump up in front of people Yeah, you get used to it, but at first Well, I think what's scary to me is to make a character and like put it on Instagram or put it on social media or put it on that to me feels so scary for some reason Like, there are parts of me that I think would love to do it, you know? I want you to do it, you should do that Yeah, I'd have to, but for some reason that is so scary to me as opposed to getting up in front of people is much less scary Yeah, I guess it's just anything you get used to it It's like, if you're scared of flying, you do it all the time and suddenly you're not, it's like that Well, you know what I think it is, Chris Mann is, for me, if they're there live, then I know immediately For me to give something to a place and let it be seen and not be able to be there and know if they're there laughing Yeah That for me, there's some fear in that, like, I need to be right there to know if they laugh or not I'm okay almost if they don't, it'll hurt me, but to put it somewhere like in a television and let them see it But not be able to actually be there and see them as they see it and know if they laugh Yeah That's something that's really like, to me, very uncomfortable Yeah, okay And that thing with TV also is it's expensive to make it, so there's a lot of expectation on it And a lot of kind of build up and hype and people love to say that you failed at it So there's this real, like, expectation thing But I kind of don't get involved in that Look, everybody knows I'm a hair boy And if you saw me when I was born, I was hair first and hair for the next half hour and then eventually baby boy Weiner and all that big feet Your confidence is important Sometimes one change can make all the difference Hair Club knows this and they're inviting you to become part of the Hair Club family to see how getting the most out of your hair can change your life They understand the emotions you're feeling and know the questions you have Hair Club is the leader in total hair solutions With the legacy of success for over 40 years Your hair is important So whether you're looking to revitalize your growth or of your hair just to learn more about the proven methods The latest ones for hair replacement or restoration Hair Club is the place to do the research They got professionally trained stylists They got hair health experts and consultants that will craft a personalized solution to ensure you feel your best and get the most out of your hair See for yourself just how powerful great hair can be I've had bad hair man But not a lot But I have had hair taken out of the back of my head and put it into the front of my head man That's reforestation baby You know what I'm saying?

Not really, like after the first show I did, We Can Be Heroes, that then obviously like in the States All the agents start calling and people are like you need to make a movie here and all that kind of stuff So that happened but I could just sense that there was going to be too much like involvement from people And everyone just wants you to do more of the same but they want to tell you how to do it So it's kind of like, and then I just was like I'm going to do, that's when I did some Heights High I came back and did that, and I didn't want to go to auditions and all that That sucks That scene, I just love, I'm just driven by a different thing which is to create something out of nothing To see the whole process through from the beginning to the end and be the person driving that That's very different experience to auditioning and being in someone else's film or whatever it is Yeah, I got offered some roles recently and I just, at first I was like, yeah I got excited but then I had to go back and apologize and say I just can't do this, I said Yeah Yeah, I like to be a creator, I don't want to do something unless, for some reason it feels scary to do something of somebody else's, I only feel comfortable doing something of my own almost Yeah, it's a different motivation and people don't get that because it sounds so like prestigious and stuff Like to be in someone else's film and people still say to me now, they're like, oh you should act one day I'm like, what do you mean? I'm like playing fucking six different characters They're like, no, no, act in a movie, like in someone else's movie Like get in a movie with like Meryl Streep and shit Yeah, that would be so dope dude, I think I'm already acting Anyway That would be so dope to see you in Bridges of Madison County too Oh yeah That would be the most legendary shit ever I'd just be laughing the whole time Imagine doing a scene with Meryl Streep, that would be hard work But to me she's pretty though, there's always about her, because she had like a motherly thing and also like a womanly thing Yeah, yeah, she's a gilf Yeah, she's like a perfect storm, like I'd breastfeed off her definitely Absolutely Who's someone you breastfeed you think off of that's over the age of 60? Judy Dench, do you know who that is? No, I'm just thinking if someone over 60, I don't know if I want it breastfed Is she a Dame Judy Dench? Yeah, sorry, I've left off the title yet She's a religious figure or she's a... She's an actress Oh, she's an actress Yeah, no I don't want to suck her, what breastfade her Yeah Shit, who was there? It was Betty White, but she's so old Yeah, I mean I definitely would go there, but not with Betty Yeah But... I'd put a straw in the tit I think now that I think about it, if it's really old You'd have to Yeah, I'm not going yet Anything over 50, I don't think I'll put my lips on, and I just, you know, would be a bit nervous probably Yeah Not very straight Now your character Becky I think is probably one of my favorite ones I think Especially when they made Fun of her in the dorm, like I could really relate to that And that's as far as I am on the show, I'm just through, I think I'm now through episode 3 maybe Of Lunatics And some of it I find myself having to go back because there's more... There's a lot going on sometimes, so it's almost like I have to listen to the wording again Like to hear everything you're saying Yeah Um... But we're... What's up with Becky? How's she doing today? Is she doing okay? She's never going to be that okay, like she's got a pretty difficult situation Um, I just like the idea that... She's basically kind of has a disability and everyone's ignoring it and pretending she's just the tall girl And she's got a lot of issues and her family just have told her how amazing she is And if they do the right thing, they've given her this false confidence So at the point when we meet her, she's kind of faking it so much But she's just a bundle of insecurity and as the show goes on she gets really involved in becoming a YouTube vlogger So she gets this confidence boost out of all her followers online and things start to take off And so she's just... it's that young girl being so insecure and just... there's no way she's not an attractive girl She's got a really... she's got massive legs She can barely walk And being too, the ankles are very big Massive ankles And they get bigger it seems like in some of the scenes Um, you're the first person to say that They don't get bigger that I think there's just more shots of them Okay, because there's a couple scenes where it looks like she put on about 40 pounds in each ankle Yeah, no, she just has some bad outfits But she just is never going to be the popular girl and all the kind of... she's always going to struggle in life And I just like that concept that the dorm life is just... everyone is just relentlessly attacking her every episode She just is bullied I don't know why I found that funny but... Yeah Because it's actually quite tragic But to me it's funny She hits her head a lot on things Oh yeah Well it's so grateful her dad came and put her You know Oh yeah, the poor dad He loves her Yeah, that's it He does his best, he's a busy dad though, he does his best And how can you relate to two girls if you're a dad, it's probably hard Yeah, and he had the perfect daughter and then the kind of freaky daughter So he kind of has tried to compensate for it by being super nice But you can only build someone's confidence up so much Yeah And the reality is she's going to have a hard time Um I'm curious to see now man, now I'm even more invested in the character Yeah, she has a bit of a love interest thing With a basketball guy I'm guessing No, don't tell me, don't tell me I'm gonna tell you that Okay, don't tell me She just wants to be a normal girl And it's a struggle Yeah That was a lot of fun I guess everybody had that, did you have like... Was there anything like, I have like a big nose, I have big ears kind of Like those are things I was insecure about when I was growing up That always like, and a nose is hard because you fucking have to show it to everybody, you know Yeah, it's there Yeah I think I also have a big nose and big ears Is that what you think? I don't think about ears that much, but now you've made me think about it Sorry Yeah, so... Yeah, you seem like you have a normal look to me Nah, it's a big nose and big ears But when you're a teenager, all that stuff is so much bigger on your face anyway Yeah And you had the big dick thing too Oh, yeah, thank God I had that, but nobody wanted to hear about that after the big nose and ears They were like, yeah, sure, God Nobody gets all three big, you know Yeah No Nobody's that much of a legend Yeah Yeah, man, I'm trying to think of what else really So you don't have any pets? Oh, you do have pets, you said I don't have pets, but I have two rainbow arcades that come to visit me every day And it's the same ones you said? Yeah, the same two, because one has like a squashed up foot, like an injured foot Oh, yeah, like somebody from Game of Thrones kind of I'll show you the photo, because he's my screensaver on my phone But yeah, they're really friendly birds, they're a big thing here in Australia, like everyone loves them I think everyone loves them, they've got good personalities Do you think that they know that you're on Telly and everything like that or no? I thought about that, I reckon they might be onto it But literally I go away for months and I come back and they're there But yeah, because they literally come into my house and get in my sink and walk Oh, wow They land on the edge of my laptop, they've seen me naked Oh, wow They're really intimate They're artistic, it sounds like Yeah They sound like photographers, they almost sound like a little bit of Well, yeah, maybe they are taking some photos, I don't know I did cross my mind that maybe, because there's some other like famous people who live in the area Like Hugh Jackman's got a place down in Bondi Oh, wow And I've always thought maybe the birds, they're going to him Because sometimes they come to mine and they've got this powdery shit on their nose And I'm like, is Jackman feeding them and then they're coming to me Yeah Or are they doing cocaine down by Jackman's? Well, yeah Yeah They're like, grabbing up down there by Jackman's and then they're like, powder on their nose Yeah I could see that, man A lot of birds, everybody thinks they're doing good shit all the time That's a crazy thing, man Yeah, these are smart birds, so it wouldn't surprise me Dude, I remember like when I was growing up, they have, in America they have a disease, it's called Down syndrome, you know And it's like people have like a, it's kind of like People just, I don't know what it is really, but They had a good buddy of mine when I was young that had it, you know And so we were children, you know, and we were good friends And I remember People always thought that he was, and he would do, we would go drink alcohol sometimes And like he would do, you know, steal shit, just regular kid shit And people thought that he was always doing like, only sweet stuff Like he always got the benefit of the doubt Yeah You know People always thought like, oh, he's probably doing a puzzle or something You know, he's with his grandparents, like, and he fucking was and he was Yeah He was raising hell, you know It's like some things like birds or whatever, they always get the benefit of the doubt, you know Yeah, we need to analyze that more carefully, yeah Just because you got colored feathers doesn't mean like you're not a dickhead Yeah, it doesn't mean you're not really raising hell somewhere Yeah They could be somewhere doing who knows what I like to, I like to follow them I bought a drone and my thought was I'm gonna like fly it off the balcony and follow the lorikeets But they're so fast, the lorikeets are so fast Plus, as soon as they hear the drone they fly So it hasn't worked so far Because they have a nest and they have babies and stuff Because they always bring their baby to me when they've had one Oh my god, this is definitely a game of thrones kind of I wanted to take the drone and find out where the nest was Imagine that Yeah You're fucking watching them, following them Yeah You could have had like a virtual reality drone And then I could go to the nest and like reach out Yeah, spend time there Like I would feel like I was flying with them Daddy's home, yeah Oh, I'm a Chinese woman coming to get you in the middle of the night, that's what you do with the babies Yes, I'm the baby's Chinese mother, yeah I like that Wouldn't that be crazy man, if one day you wake up like in heaven or something And you come to and you just look in the mirror and you're an actual Chinese woman I would love, that would be amazing I don't know if I'd love that, I'd be so surprised Is that what happens, you go to heaven and the real you is revealed I bet there has to be some sort of revelation or some sort of like an exposure Almost like you expose a photo where you see, oh this is Yeah, you thought you got away with this, this is the real thing Yeah, this is what was going on, you were fucking around, you know You were playing with these birds on the balcony in the head, you know Yeah, cameras in their eyes Yeah Yeah, you were feeding birdseed to a camera for fucking five years man Imagine that, and you have to watch the footage in heaven And you look like such an idiot too, you just keep feeding this camera on birdseed Seriously, that could happen Was there ever like an entertainer from the states that reached out like Jim Carrey or somebody like that That was like, oh I have to do something with this guy I can imagine that that's probably happened to you over the years That I've reached out to me Yeah, and they wanted to like, they were just real keen on trying to work with you And keen means excited, I just learned it like two days ago But yeah, they were excited to try and have you in their project I mean, even though it wasn't something maybe you were looking for but Yeah, there's been a little bit of that But sort of just more coming from like casting people with directors and stuff Rather than actual like artists Like a lot of them, actually that's not really like people do There's been big big name people who are fans of the shows and have reached out Yeah, that happens a fair bit But I can't feel like a dickhead naming who those people are Oh yeah, no, I'm not asking who they are Yeah, I'm just asking if that's ever happened I guess like, yeah, I guess I was just kind of thinking like Because if I thought of like one of my favorite movies is Dumb and Dumber, right? So I thought, well, would you ever see, you know, is that something that Like David Spade the other day was telling me that Chris Farley Got offered the role of, and there's something about Mary That Ben Stiller played, the main guy And I just never knew that, it just blew my mind Because then I start thinking of that movie And if Chris Farley plays Ben Stiller, it's just interesting, you know So I guess I was just wondering if there had ever been like a unique role Or if somebody had ever, or just if it had ever happened, not like specifics, you know That has been a few roles, it's never like the handsome lead It's always like the kind of he, it's like the freak, the weird butler or something Kind of, yeah, one of them was like the, it was like James Franco's PA or something But obviously it was something like Camp Widow, like I get those roles Like basically they've seen some of our title, like can you do Mr. G? But we're not going to say that, but Right You got to keep that magic for yourself Yeah, yeah, I don't want to do that Yeah, yeah, I don't like to outsource my magic if I have any, you know Or not magic, but whatever I do have, you know Yeah, I don't want to just put it into whatever I'd rather save it and maybe hope that it, you know, that it can be good somewhere specifically Yeah, I'm the same So Well So you've only seen three episodes Yeah Yeah, alright And also, I also haven't seen I haven't seen the Heroes movie that you did Yeah Yeah, I can tell the bits that you haven't seen because you kind of just Your eyes glaze off I know it's hard to hide it, huh? Yeah I know, I feel bad sometimes But you can't watch everything No, you can't, there's a lot of stuff Yeah And I'm kind of glad I haven't seen everything because then there's some things that I can be like You know, still amazed by, like I'm only on season two of Game of Thrones Oh yeah, I'm on season one Are you?

We got the RSO Yeah Go down to the RSO and maybe have a cocktail The Ari Yeah, I can see that Do some video games or something in a dress though You do some swing dancing I reckon Yeah But you'd be sort of, yeah, attractive when you want it to be, mostly butch Yeah, mostly just fucking riding the rails Yeah Out there, just getting people where they need to go It'd be fun Yeah I think you could just do that for a day Be a real woman Yeah I think in a couple years you'll be able to I think in a couple years like with all these hormones and stuff they have now I think Just chuck it on for a day Yeah Chuck on a fucking puss in a couple tits, you know Yeah And hit the You know, go watch You know, something A film or walk, take a run Yeah I'd like to run as a woman I bet, go for a jog Yeah, the sports bra Just let it all Spit if you want Yeah So you always got a butch woman Yeah, that's true Yeah Well being the pretty one would scare me I think It seemed like so much pressure That would be hard work Yeah I don't envy that Always having a look kind of like perfect Eat your soup real perfectly Yeah It would make me nervous Everyone's staring at you Yeah Think about that, everybody's staring at you and it happens when you're young and then it makes you That would make me so nervous Yeah, it'd be hard Yeah, I don't know what else I would be maybe I could see you also being like The guy like on a soccer team that like is in a wheelchair there on the side Oh yeah And he's like He's in the team but they just, it's like a sympathy thing And they wheel him out once a year and kind of wheel him down the grass Yeah Down the grass Or yeah, it's like cause the field is a little bit Oh yeah It's a cheap field, yeah Yeah It's down here a little Yeah, I could do that Trying to think of some other Oh, I could also see you doing like a Robin Hood type of Oh yeah I could see you being like a Robin Hood Yeah Rob's from the rich and gives to the poor Yeah Does he swing through? No, it's Tarzan Isn't like climb trays and shit, is he Robin Hood? I could see you being like Tarzan's brother that wants to do something different Oh yeah To get out of the jungle a little Alternative, like, yeah, he's a bit of an Amo Tarzan Yeah It's skinnier Yeah It's gonna be a bit of a gut Yeah His girlfriend's not that hot Yeah, she's not that hot, dude And she comes to the edge of the forest and like gives him books and shit And cassette tapes, even though he's gonna have a player Yeah She's always a bit depressed Yeah, I could see you doing that Let me think of some options Do you think sometimes, like, do you know when a character comes into your head you like Like for lunatics, you know, did you have them all planned out And obviously you had ideas and you said once you get to set Yeah You get in makeup, it grows even more But was there another character that you went to set with that you guys did Yeah That you left on the floor? Not that we got that far with, but in the writing stage I had like about eight characters all armed And then I kind of had to narrow it down I remember doing a drawing, actually, and I'm not even good at drawing stuff It's like of all of the characters together And so you could just look at the line up and was imagining it, how it would work And then there was a couple of characters that I just thought, nah, you're kind of crossing out It's like a little too similar to that, it's similar to something you've done before That's the thing, because I've done a lot of characters now, so I have to always Different, I've done, you know, once you do long red hair, you can't do that again So you got to think of different hairstyles Yeah, so a few of them I got rid of, but then are some of the great ideas I sort of morph those ideas into the current characters So, yeah Yeah, it's hard to find new characters, I bet, because once you've done like a guy, if it's a gay guy, you can't It's like you could do another one, but it's still kind of sticks on the, it'll stick to the other one That's it, yeah It's hard, and there's always a little bit of a crossover, because there's certain things you find funny or interesting So you're always kind of going down the same path a little bit Yeah, but that's actually the challenge now is to make it different, because I've done a lot of characters now Is that kind of, I mean, even though it's like, I'm sure there's a great sense of pride with that Is there a little bit of like, is it almost kind of a bummer sometimes that you've gone through like a lot of Humanity and character, you know, that you have that much of a body Yeah, it is, because sometimes you've got a slightly different take on it, and I'm like, oh fuck, that would be better But I'm like, yeah, but you kind of did that, like you've done like the fashion thing or the skate thing, whatever it is Surf or whatever the kind of world is Yeah Or I've done an Asian woman before, and I'm like, I can't really do that again Yeah But I do bring characters back, like there's been a lot of like spin-offs and stuff Yeah Yeah, they come back Well, I've seen, I think some of the stuff I've seen, I've seen like Jonah from Tonga and I've seen, I mean, yeah, it was just too much sometimes Oh, but so good, and it helped me learn about like Tongan people a little bit and like the characters and it gave me like a sense of like What it would actually be like to be at a school when you're young like that, you know And when he goes and lives with his auntie Yeah Oh shit, God, I fucking miss that family dude Yeah I miss the fam, I miss the fucking auntie, man It feels so real, like it feels like that, that they exist out there somewhere still Yeah Does it feel like that to you too? Yeah, to me it does, yeah It's, yeah, and it's kind of, yeah, I'm kind of caught up in the illusion of it as well Yeah Weirdly Yeah, I can totally, I can totally imagine that You know, a lot of kids these days their imagination is changing because, you know, with social media, with computers and stuff, it's different Like you can create stuff actually more So your imagination is almost like the processor now is in the machine Yeah And whether then it used to be, you have to be in your head, you know It's a little bit scary, I wonder if they'll ever have, you know, if they'll ever be able to do some of the stuff that, you know You and I have been able to do growing up, like if the medium will change so much that they won't even Like, why is this guy pretending to be this character when he could just, you know Yeah, you're right That's weird, isn't it? It's already kind of evolved a lot in the last 10 years or so, so, yeah Does it scare you a little bit? No, I just kind of roll with it, like, it's funny doing the show with Netflix because they have this sort of, the episodic thing But all the apps kind of run together for most people, most people sit back and watch like one and a half episodes or something And then the episode length time, so we're sort of, they're basing it on the model of old broadcast TV But it's actually already evolving into this thing, it's just this linear entertainment thing that people just tap into when they want to And, yeah, we're sort of in this weird transition where it's a little bit, there's a little bit left over from the past Yeah And kind of like, yeah, like when films first started and it was like Vaudeville performers and shit and they were like It was all just like watching a theatrical production, like you were kind of looking at it from one perspective And then it kind of evolved and people were like, well, shit, we could get different angles and we could edit this Yeah Anyway, I don't know why I'm standing like, I know what I'm talking about You just seen it's changed Yeah, it's evolving and so I started doing 25 minute episodes or whatever And they went to air once a week and now I'm doing this kind of long thing that just keeps flowing together And yeah, it's cool Has it been cool? Has it been, was it as cool of an experience doing lunatics as anything else? Yeah Well, cool and better in the way that it reached people because normally I have to like launch it in different countries And you're kind of dealing with different networks where this was just like, they just press the button and suddenly it's all over the world Yeah It's a big audience So, but making the show was pretty much the same experience, I guess, as all of them because, yeah It's so crazy, there are moments where I'll look at you and I'll see like just another character will pop into my head that it's like I forgot about a little bit Oh, really? You know, even from the past, yeah, there'll be like an angle where it's like, oh, there's a Mr. G, you know? Or be like an angle and then be like, oh, that's fucking, you know, oh, I see how he's built, that's how Jonah was built, you know? Like, just like the way your arm is bent, it's just kind of bizarre, man, you know? Yeah, it is really cool I don't see myself, I guess, I don't really get that experience unless I'm looking in the mirror or something, but Yeah, I can imagine, that must be weird. People often do try to say who they think I'm the most like They do say that quite a lot But that must change though, because then suddenly there are moments where I'm like, oh, he definitely seems like Gavin a little bit more, you know? Yeah The Earl of, what is it called? Gaius, yeah Gaius, what a fucking great name Chris Lilly, man, thank you so much I don't think there's anything else really, I mean, we can kind of chill and wrap it up, is that okay with you? Yeah, that sounds good, it's been really fun Has it been? Yeah, I didn't know what to expect, but it's been so relaxed and you're very easy to talk to Well, thanks, man, I appreciate it, yeah, I wanted this to be just a, I mean, I think this would be a great episode, man Our listeners are going to absolutely be over the moon just to have, to be able to have like just an experience with you Just as a regular person, you know? Yeah, it's just inspiring, man, it's inspiring to see like, because there's nothing else out there like you So people need to see it and young people need to see it so they can be reminded, oh, I can do that, you know? Yeah Because that's how I learned about stuff, watch it, I would see in living color and like Damon Wayans and stuff I'd be like, oh, I can do that, that's a thing? Yeah Wow, now I'm going to do that, you know? Yeah, I get kids' enemy videos all the time of characters, like they, it does inspire kids Oh, that's great Yeah, it's fun That would be great Do you plan to, will you make more stuff in the future? You're not going to, you don't have any plans on quitting being creative, do you? Not at all, no, I love doing this Thank you It's so fun, I can't wait to do more Cool, brother Chris Lilly, ladies and gentlemen, check out Lunatics And then go back if you haven't and watch Summer Heights High, Jonah from Tonga And you'll fall into the rest of the world and tell your friends about it Because, yeah, for some reason, Summer Heights High is the greatest gift I can give to any of my friends that haven't I'm like, have you seen this? And when they say no, I'm just like, oh, fucking Merry Christmas, motherfucker You know, it's fun Thank you, brother Thanks, man Now I'm just floating on the breeze And I feel I'm falling like these leaves I must be cornerstone Oh, but when I reach that ground I'll share this peace of mind I found I can feel it in my bones But it's gonna take a little time For me to set that parking brake And let myself unwind Shine that light on me I'll sit and tell you my stories Shine on me And I will find a song I will sing it just for you",

I'm down maybe 70 hairs or down maybe 60 80 hundred hair or a hundred 200 hairs And I say dang well, I'm doing hat today And there's there's days when I wake up and I'm feeling full Like my hair like a Like maybe my hair had other hair stay overnight and sleep at the house and so suddenly my head looks full of hair You know, like it's like a family reunion or something for follicles Oh Let's get into the episode Oh, I'm just sitting on your front porch wondering how could I be so far from my Oh, and my mind is somewhere else, but when I find it, I'll patch up where it's been Now I'm just on the breeze and I feel I'm falling like these leaves. I must be Oh, but when I reach that ground, I'll share this piece of mind. I found I can see it In my bones But it's gonna take a little time For me to set that parking brake and let myself on my side Oh, wow, thank you. Hello. Hello everyone. I'm coming to you. It is Monday, May 6 in a year two thousand and one nine 2019 we're calling it or two zero one nine for people that just do individual numbers But still keep time This is it. This is where we are You know, this is where we are this is where I am. That's what I'm realizing a little bit today. This is where I am Damn You know sometime and I don't like making decisions man this hat thing I couldn't do I go had do I go no hat and Then I started thinking at least men we have that option You got that get out of You got that get out of if your hair looks if your hair is looking a little ugly and the more you got that get out of ugly free card That hat you put the hat on a hat is just a small apartment for your head Once you get inside a hat, it's almost like being indoors a little bit and that's what I've always enjoyed the most about a hat is That you put a hat on and suddenly It's like you're indoors a little bit it's like you got a little you know like um You got a little more a little more between you and the world you got a little bit of You know, I like being a little bit more comforted. I'm that comforted cat Some cats you see them out there on the power lines walking the power lines and doing cigarettes and You know, maybe they uh, they'll get their tail corn road And they're out there and fucking you know doing dice and shit like that and and hanging out all you know Out in Philadelphia or different places, you know, but I'm that comfort cat I like to have a little bit of a hat on sometimes, you know, I like to put you know Sometimes I'll put a little bit of cotton in my shirt. I'll empty a bag of cotton into my shirt So people can't see it out here, but I'm comforted. I Got that extra go on happening. I got that at you know You know, I got that I got that that fluff inside of me. Just just I need a little bit more comfort You know, sometimes I used to have a neighbor and he was Real real big guy and they called him his name was Wayne, but they called him fat Wayne I didn't call him that his dad did actually but and uh, I'd sleep over at his house sometimes and we'd sleep in his bed We was laying his bed, you know, because he lived there and he had it and that's where he kept his bed, obviously and we would lay in his bed and When he fell asleep, you couldn't wake him up You thought he was dead until he woke up and he may have been dead He may not even have actually gone to sleep at night. He may have died and Then just just risen every morning, you know, maybe he just had those religious You know, he just zoned out and then re-zoned back in but He would when so and he would fall asleep it, you know, you could you could put things on his back You could do um, you know, you could play soldiers on his back and do little, you know The army coming up over here up over to uh, you know, the scapula and then the other, you know You could do fighters, you know Rambo versus, you know, She-Ra and Um And you could do different stuff like that On his back, you know, you could do whatever But I remember when I would go to when I would be time for bed. I would lay down next to him and I put his arm over me And his arm had like a tattoo on it or something. I don't remember what it was. Let me think about now. What was that? It may have been a couple um What was that a snowman or something or some bacon and His arm and I'd put his arm over me. I'd put his arm over me and then that's how I would sleep You know, I'm just that comfort cat You know, I'm just that comfort cat man. I like to have a little bit of extra I like to have a little bit. I need a little more support You know, I'm the kind of guy you'll find a training wheel on my back just one Just that one hitter You know, I'm the kind of guy who uh Who if I lay down next to you I'll throw it I'll throw your arm over me You know for a little while now You know, I'll share I'll do you for a while to us, you know Once I get a little rest I'll wake up and I'll throw one of my arms over you or two arms because I got a lean medium arms. I Got these medium reachers. I can't even if somebody with really short arms wants to shake my hand. I can't get there You know, there's medium arms, but I'll put both of them on you So you feel a little bit of comfort as well because I know what it feels like You know, I know what it feels like not only do I recognize that I need comfort But then I have to then also do the inverse of that I got to recognize what it feels like if somebody else needs comfort Because I have to notice that like if there's something that I that I have a The the that I that I require Then there's gonna be something that somebody else then there's then I should notice that same Requirement or deficiency and others immediately You know, and that's really been something that Has been brought to some of the forefront of my life over the past couple years Since I started trying to get into like 12 step and learning about things is that Is some of that awareness just realizing oh Just how common it is when I have an issue that somebody else have it That I can notice that issue in them and not accuse them of having it. I don't even have to say it But I could recognize man, you know, I recognize this person they might I can try to just show them extra comfort I'll just take a gamble that they need more comfort But I am that uh Okay, all right, who's was that water? Jesus I am I can be that comfort cat. Thank you guys for being here today. I I did put a hat on for those you listen over audio I Am happy I'm happy to be here man.

That's how it goes That leads me into this man I'll say this perfect timing support for this past weekend comes from manscaped who is number one in men's below the belt grooming Manscaped offers precision engineered tools for manscaping with the right tool for the job and Manscaping I got their package. They got that 2.0 kit. It features that lawn mower trimmer with that skin safe technology And they got them tools where you could really jump, you know, you could unjunk you jump and And unfunk you skunk, you feel me?

I know it's what could be morning when you're listening If you fire, you know, if you did body gas if you did gas out of your body out of your butt Then on a mirror that you could see it You know that in regular if you just you know did body gas out of the air you can't see it You know you could obviously it has a you know of Mostly violent scent every now, you know every maybe 2,000 body gases. You'll get one. That's really you're like damn They should you know make a good candle out of that one. That's You know something, you know things are going well But the other 1,999 Attempts at body gas you get something naughty, you know you get that, you know You just get that booty ghost that's out there just haunting people's senses But someone had told us how I remember when I was a kid Someone told us or maybe they just wrote it on a sidewalk with a knife, but That if you you know did body gas on a mirror if you were sitting on a mirror or near a mirror like with your butt up You know stood in on the sink with your butt against the mirror And you did a gas that You could see it then it would take a you know as if it was a ghost or something. I guess that's how we thought oh I could see it. I could see what's you know And so that was it man. We'd sit on these mirrors, you know, we got a couple mirrors. They had a arm An old lady that lived I mean everybody had this old lady that live we had an old little part about two and a half blocks away and Her house I think burned down at some point. I mean that usually happens with a lot of those older women But before it happened we'd go over there and she would give us a you know A little couple dimes or whatever to water the plants and do this and that you know look for the cats and I'll tell you this honestly man She she all you know she she only had probably Two cats but she paid us to find about nine cats So we'd take one of the cats bring it in there show it to her She would you know say its name and pet it then then it would we'd let it go and say okay We're gonna find the other one and then we'd go find the same This the you know they only had to so we find the other one bring it in and just keep going back and forth until she thought She'd seen them all but really it was just two cats who were psyched, you know we were You know the old The old cat, you know cat switch game well So we got you know, we so next thing, you know, we showed her all the cats We got these dimes or whatever, but anyway, she had some nice mirrors So I know we'd be over there and once you got the cats out of the way She we can hang out in our house. She didn't even know we're in there, you know we climb on the shelves and you know look at books or whatever look at little trinkets and this and that and She had nice drawers heavy wood and you pull open a heavy wood drawer and you smell wood, you know, and it was It just had a different experience, you know being over there, you know, all of her stuff felt kind of old and mysterious Bruh, you know felt like you could just open up a can of peas or a can of carrots at her house And and a damn spirit would pop out. It had that kind of That kind of momentum was just built into the environment. Well, anyway, so Oh So she had these nice mirrors big ones that we could set on the floor take them off the wall set them on the floor And you do body you sit on there with your butt out do body gas and look for the ghost, you know But we never saw anything You know, we never saw I mean people would lie and say they saw something but nobody ever saw anything man But that reminds me of that Mirvart and that's that day Mirvart In Amsterdam Netherlands and that's September 24th, and that's that But yeah, thank everybody so much man. I'm overwhelmed it. You know the amount of support People that are gonna come out and see the shows just You know man, it just really feels like a dream come true in a lot of ways So, thank you, thank you very very much to everyone and when they came out of New York City this weekend Man, it was a wild time. I mean Carl Lentz pass pop through The pastor and he's gonna come and be a guest at some point We had a father-son pair that came through that it, you know, they drove from about two hours We have people that drove from Vermont People that drove from Delaware people that drove down from Canada and came in We had a young man. I'll put this thing on my Instagram. He made me a beautiful skateboard Like Beyonce, you know like that, you know And they had I mean just some really nice gifts Somebody gave me a Darryl strawberry book really cool and then a taxi Cause everybody knows I do that story. Um, but let me get into a little bit of this episode, man Well, I still have my hat on and while I'm still feeling you know, you know, like I'm that comfort cat Oh a lot of cats in this episode. Let's realize that Yeah, man, we go to that ladies house and you know what I wonder in hindsight, maybe she knew that she only had two cats ladies house and you know what I wonder in hindsight maybe she knew that she only had not two cats you know maybe she knew maybe we thought that she didn't have the awareness but she did and so that way we just got to spend more time over there and they gave us something to do maybe she knew we didn't have much to do you know and she would do that you know and I remember she I remember now actually she spent it she split out split a can of them frank and uh weaners you know used to have these cans bean and weaners they used to have these cans called uh bean and weaners and it was a can of beans and weaner and they cut up half a weaner in there and it looked like they cut the weaner with a spoon because the edges of the weaner cut they weren't straight there were those uh uh convex them convex cuts you get that wean the you know usually you get a cut of weaners you know it's the the width of the wean and then it's that where the cuts are them chops but on these uh we need wean bean wean and beaners on these wean and beaners they had um um the cut the the cuts on the weaner were you know convex or something like you're trying to see the moon you know through glass but the uh oh shit man what am I talking about but she would cut open a can of those and we'd have them over there me and little Daniel be over there having them man and I'll tell you this about Daniel man people forget about him and don't want to think about him dude Daniel was up to no good man most of the time but I'll say this a lot of times they had rumors going around this is back when rumors was really the most popular way to know about stuff and these days thanks to all the uh you know mainstream media being a bunch of dog shit it's welcome back rumors so the um you know Daniel would get in there and he uh he would eat the when he'd eat you know he'd always steal a chunk of my wean out of the uh out of my bean and weaners you know and and and in hindsight I remember a couple times he got sick because he he stole that chunk see there's just two sides this there's two sides to everything you know he stole that chunk and he got sick and I didn't get sick because I would just wait to see how he did how he fared after that chunk of frank and then I would just be around him if he looked like he was getting real sweaty halfway into his own bowl I say damn I'm uh you know you know you know you know you've heard of Frank Sinatra while I'm saying Sianara Frank's because I'm saying bye bye to these frank chunks to these you know wean these wean cuts and I wouldn't have them because little Daniel be over there sweating dude and when he sweat his shirt he he he had this like uh I guess his shirt he had maybe one of those constricting shirts so when he got real sweaty his shirt would get even smaller but let's get into a couple of calls man those european dates are out thank you uh you know so much um a lot of people have called in last week I was talking about you know father-son relationship and uh and man I got so many nice responses and messages and just wanted to say thank you uh just thanks for you know just thanks for not judging me while I think about stuff um you know I appreciate that like you know that's why I don't like sometimes it's hard to be in this world I think for a lot of us because we created an environment we didn't the dark arts created an environment where we can't even think or feel or share sometimes without being judged you know and I'm not saying that I don't do that sometimes we all do it but I'll be damned if some if there's people out there making a business out of it uh man it makes me mad um so but maybe inadvertently I do you know like I we never know what we do sometimes until we figure it out but but I just want to say I get a lot of nice just people that can relate people that are sharing their own stories with me and it just makes me feel and then when I hear somebody else's story or they're sharing something man it makes me feel like a human because it makes me feel wow you know I have feelings I care about what this person's saying I have feelings man it reminds me it reminds me that I have feelings because the feelings man this you know the sugar lizard goes for whatever but whatever that other animal is that feeling animal he's more like a sloth you know he's easy you know he's around the surface man but he gets scared to kind of peek around sometime maybe he is like a cat maybe that feeling line or that feline that feel line yeah that's what it is man so if I don't go with that sugar lizard then I can I can be patient and I can have a little bit of that feel line feel what choice I make not just not just that sugar lizard get whatever what is that a snicker a titty whatever you got to be aware that sugar lizard that first thing and that's who all these advertisers and all these you know all those bulls that's who they're selling to they're selling to that sugar lizard oh you got a dime let me set that right over there what's that a twinkie what's that a nipple what's that a fake uh you know uh fake net you know a neck installment or whatever fake titty they sell you all of that set it right there that's what you need get that let that sugar lizard bites whatever first thing out there but you when you when you let that when you what just wait don't sugar don't don't don't sugar you can sugar you can feel the sugar don't lizard don't let that fucking little reptile rep don't let him rep you I wait back I'll try and wait back let that feel line what do I feel what do I really need to do for me right now to be okay would what do I really need to do right now to be okay to really be okay and that feel line man I notice whenever you know people come up and are accepting and you know sharing like or just you know I'm just grateful to have an environment here where we can share stuff and not feel judged and maybe there are people out there that judge and sometimes look man I'll be the first to tell you sometimes I'm a real poise you know sometimes I'm way too caught up in my feelings and I can't get out of it you know and that look that's where I am right now but I also you know I mean I try to I try to be out there and get past some of this stuff and I feel a lot better than I used to you know I got a lot more tools but every now and then your feelings flare up and that's okay I mean sometimes we go through episodes we don't even talk about anything like that but uh but I just want to say I'm grateful to have that sort of environment here where people don't always just sugar lizard oh look at this love yes they're talking about his feelings again uh because I think we have a world that don't let us feel enough that don't let us explore enough you know that don't let us just be brave to share and to say you know and we don't do that here you know we don't I mean I hear this in a lot of different rooms but we don't hear we don't we don't we don't kill our wounded this ain't hollywood um whatever I don't know

forget to thank those mothers and i want to thank actually right now um you know all our patreoners sorry i feel like i'm talking too much some of those get kind of going and i feel like i'm talking too much sometimes um you know the people that support our patreoners that's how we are able to do nice things for um the single moms and uh get that cash where we hide the you know we hide money in the hotel room for the cleaning ladies and um and those things are on the youtube but uh that's what our patreon goes to you know our patreon isn't really big a lot of people run their whole you know podcast off their patreon we don't do that here you know and not that and that's okay no shade on anybody's uh but how we find things to do um you know outreach and stuff is through our patreon and i just want to say that we are going to reach out to all the single moms that we have uh that we've brought out to shows over the past year year and a half and we're going to send all of them some flowers uh so i just thought of that but um but we're going to do that so that's something our patreon is going to do so if you are a patreon supporter just know that already uh this weekend you bought flowers for about 12 different single moms around america and uh and the cards they don't say that this from me it says this from us and um so i hope you feel good about that because i do you know i do um you know it's thing in the other day that when we look at our mother and i've this has been on my mind a lot when we look at our mom when if you or if you're raised by a single parent as a child you look at that parent and you hold them accountable for motherly stuff and fatherly stuff you don't even realize it because you need it all you need it all as a child and we hold that we hold our mom accountable for fatherly ways and not only that but then the mother also has to be a father and it gets really jumbly man for me it did anyway you know i'm sorry for me it got jumbly and only now am i able to kind of look through some of that and and start to be able to sort it out and wonder well why do i why this and why that you know am i holding my mother accountable or for things that that a father should have been there for and i hold my father for things that a mother should have been there for and not even knowing not even realizing it but mother's day is a great opportunity to reconnect with somebody that you care about so uh from from me all the single moms out there uh we love you guys and thank you for all the hard work that you do and we know it's not easy sometimes you know i can only imagine if your husband or something whoever who created this child with you left you and men too you know if whoever created created that child with you left and left you to care about them man there's got to be a an anger there an angst you know uh that man they didn't even care about it enough about you to stay in this they didn't care enough about the child to really stay in it or to help and then you have to be even stronger and not tell the kid that you can't you can't bat you can't really bastardize that other parent because it's so i'm sure just a lot of levels going on i'm not in that space but i can only imagine what it's like you know but man what a beautiful job um what else oh so i got a couple patreon questions that came in so these are victor s johnson the second asked in a previous episode you mentioned you don't feel a sense of community out in los angeles has that changed at all you know what since podcasting it has changed i've kind of built my own community a little bit or not we've built a community and also since i got into uh 12 step programs since i got into that sort of thing for me i have much more of a sense of community i have people every day now that i can call and reach out to uh that are reaching out to me you know i have meetings that i go to where i meet up with others so there has been a sense of community there uh at the comedy store that's become a sense of community i was just taking a lot longer to find um and i do think also that uh la to me just feels more and more like an airport it feels like like an international airport even all the way from when you leave when you leave the airport at lax it still feels like an airport like the whole time i'm here whether i'm at home at work wherever it all feels like a big extension of the airport so you know that feeling you have when you're in an airport you know your people are passing you're seeing them and you're oh yeah let's do this let's end it but everybody's just taking off everybody's coming back or taking that's what la always feels like to me everywhere so i think within that space it's hard to have a sense of community when there's just so much motion going on but i'm grateful you know i got guys like brennan schaub i got um producer nick uh you know i got little gianni who's uh you know the you know the movie star twink he's you know we just got you know there's a group that i have yeah so it's gotten better that's the short answer but thank you for the question that's from our patreon supporter victor johnson um let me see what else uh anhel perez said your comedy is always so creatively descriptive have you ever written any short stories or things that aren't comedy um yeah yeah i have you know um you know i've tried to get some books published over the years i haven't tried in a while uh just about growing up um you know one fiction one nonfiction one just like growing up and just how fear kind of ran a lot of my life and just how uh you know the first memories i have are just of being afraid of stuff you know i remember when my father was you know obviously i'm not going to say again how old my father was i always say it um but one of my first memories was i remember walking i woke up at night and i walked into this other room in our house and my sister was real sick you know she was born with a rare disease and uh she needed a transplant and my father was like rocking her in this rocking chair and he was crying and he was real sad you know and uh and i knew that my sister was sick and i saw him crying and it just like you know i don't know it just made me real scared it made me scared out of the beginning um but yeah i've written some stuff about that i've written some funny stories uh and i think as i get a little bit more settled after i get done touring next year i'm gonna try to focus a little bit more on getting back to some writing um creating some fun stuff that's not uh touring as much because this touring takes a lot out of me right now and then one more from fey divorce shack what books or movies have had an impact on the way you think about things what was going on in your life at the time that you read or saw them and how do they change your thinking oh wow i don't know about some of that that's deep what books or movies you know i like that movie uh bridges of madison county you know there's just a moment of choice in there a moment of love a moment of comfort you know it just shows how people's lives can interact and they're not really you know how every decision you make isn't so well it just shows that you can get love in different places and that there's different levels to love and different parts of love some love you get from here and some love you get from there so i like that movie bridges of madison county and it's about bridges man bridges you know because think about this before bridges what people had to try and jump over something so if you wanted to get a message to somebody across the whatever water you know or whatever dragon area you had to get a buddy feed him a bunch of steaks and everything train him you know get him a rosary a couple rosaries you know tell him he was gonna make it and then send him out there running and the dragon got him you know i'm saying so bridges are everything bridges are really because before that you had to get wet or get eaten or get burnt i mean bridges is name you know name 11 other things that are better than that over time maybe and you know and everybody did a bridge that wasn't just an obenjamin franklin hogging all the uh um you know old b frankie hogging all the damn inventions everybody did a bridge ben so sorry i shouldn't have got upset about that but that's shit kind of you know a lot of times all these old people that is put you know you know you know einstein fucking who else what's that guy's name uh miss iraq steve miss iraq um yeah all these people say they invented everything thomas jefferson tj and oh yeah you guys did it all but no everybody did bridges um but i'll have to get more deeper into that one another time fave but thank you for that question about you know what things were going on in your life at the time you read or saw them uh i don't remember that's you know my my brain doesn't work like that my memory is not that strong in that sense um but thank you for your support and that is definitely one of my favorite movies and books and that that that bridges madison county that's word for word book moving for movie and the patriot as always you know is one of my favorite movies ever and probably always will be aim small miss small i can't solve a big problem man but i could solve this little small one and that'll get me to the next little small one gang gang man let's get to a couple of calls that came in because i'm about to go get lunch onward hold on that's not okay on gang gang what's up bio gang gang brother onward uh man i love you bro uh just went to your uh your show in new york city you did a really great job made my birthday really special uh you know uh well thank you man i appreciate that yeah that club i don't think that they did a good job they tried to hurry the vip you know the meet and greets and hurry it up at the end of the show um they were flashing the lights on us you know i don't know what and hopefully everybody's experience was great but you know the guy the man they it definitely wasn't you know it wasn't i hope you guys's experience was good i'll just leave it at that uh because yeah they had just the music just things that you know are basic things it didn't seem like they cared that much about the people coming to the shows um but it's a time square business down there in time square and it's just you know they're just running people it felt like a diner where they did comedy yet but um but i appreciate everybody that came let's hear more man sorry i've been a little negative i met you after the show you told me that uh you know you might have relapsed with the cigarette hitters but uh it's all right man you know there's another day another dollar and we're out here and uh you know i was good for three months no cigarettes and then i recently also started again but you know we'll we'll put them hitters you know and uh you just gotta try again and try again until you know they say uh the success gets better uh the more times you do in the longer days that you've uh you know been often thanks uh once again i appreciate it oh yeah and then monday's podcast yeah thanks man yeah i got back on them cigarettes about a week ago and so some of it is i just get so tired and just so exhausted it's like i just don't have anything i can't sleep saturday night i couldn't even sleep i was up all night dude i've never been up all night since i was i don't even know since i probably had colic or something as a child or if there was a snake in the room i could never sleep if there was a snake in the room but uh but yeah so i'm back on them ritz man gang onward remember last monday's podcast i wanted to ask you you know like you're talking a lot about your dad and stuff and and your feelings uh uh you know his relationship there and do you think you'd be a different comedian if you had if you were a father yourself you know that's a good question would i be a different comedian if i were a father myself um you know it's funny sometimes i think i'm afraid to get into a family and that sort of thing because it'll change the way that i see the world a little bit and i just want to make sure i get everything out of the way i see the world right now or yeah or would i have anything to joke about then well i'd just be some you know such an emo nemo i'll turn into a damn emo shark you know and then i'll just be you know just holding my son just crying on like the bank of a river all the time like you know i just so i start to wonder like yeah i just i don't know it's like i'm i'm kind of at a little bit of a place where i'm comfortable you know i'm that comfort cat and so i don't know if i you know it gets scary for me to think oh well if i have a family am i still going to be able to be okay because i don't want to damage them either you know i don't want to damage you know i don't want to you know i don't want to mess up you know i don't want to mess up some little kid's life or you know shoot i don't want to create single moms that's not that's not the thing that we're trying to do so but that's a good question man i appreciate you calling man as always the hotline 985-6649-503 let's take another call here hey this is christie from atlanta hey christie from atlanta thank you for calling i appreciate you calling um from that atl i heard your podcast about how you felt like you used to be maybe ashamed of your father and i wanted to say you know my dad was never really a fancy guy in atlanta everyone's dads go to golf clubs all the time oh yeah they got a lot of fancy people over there i know who you're talking about i know exactly what you're talking about the fancy onward everyone's dads are buying new cars and that's just kind of how dads are here my dad's from ecuador so he has always just he does not care at all what he what he looks like or anything but it really for me i felt like it made me more of a proud person and like realize what happiness was much more because instead of golfing and buying cars my dad was like building bombs and blowing them up in the backyard making kayaks out of wood you know collecting abandoned TVs and using them like using the screens to make fires in the back you know just doing a wizardry a sound like you talking about some real wizardry but now i know what you're talking about it's like you got to see more of a creative type of of dad instead of you know a lot of times and this does happen in a lot with a lot of tradition in different communities i find that people just live into these streams of tradition and they don't create their own kind of canals of creativity a lot of times it sounds like your father was definitely doing you know was doing a little bit more creativity and in creativity you get to see who someone is you get to see some of the colors of them onward doing cool stuff and for me that that was actually a better way to grow up and so i'm like i'm grateful for that you know but thanks you know well it sounds like uh yeah it sounds like you got to have a unique experience with your dad yeah it's um it's so weird too it's like you know we just don't realize some stuff when we're young and sometimes we realize it later you know we don't know and that's life isn't it man man it's like you play a lot of the game and then like years later you kind of get to watch the game back and review how it went and it's always feels like that it's so hard to get to get i don't know it's so hard to get it where you're where who you are and the way you feel about life matches up in real time with what's going on and maybe some of that just comes with time and age um let's take another call here thank you for that call uh young lady hey this is raid man and uh i'm from california but i'm in a rodeo what's up read dude rodeo i've been thinking about rodeo that's crazy that you called man i've been thinking about the rodeo boy i like going to the rodeo seeing those wranglers seeing that hat seeing them buckles seeing them yaw yaw yaw some steeds i'm riding

college i'm a sophomore this year and uh at the fesma state university nice man congratulations on your sophomore shift man you're getting it done onward and uh in between classes man i set up my schedule weird so i got a lot of breaks in between my classes and i listen to your podcast and the king of the sting and the buzzing the thing and whatnot now this king of this thing is pretty funny brother that one's such a goofy and we just goof around in there onward now listen all them and man i wouldn't i would be lying if i didn't if i said i didn't get my hairstyle after you i got a little bit of a rat tail pg brother praise god ptl baby praise the lord and my brother's got that rat tail too man came in i had a full mullet but i decided to go and like kind of a mohawk and leave the tail in the back i'm kind of upset with chin or whoever wants a submission department for the king of the sting i spent in a video a few weeks back and freaking i don't know if chin filters through all the other cool videos that they stopped saying then and he takes a matter whatnot but mine didn't get in there and i didn't watch it for a week or so so it's kind of set one to see uh how you guys react uh talking about the rodeos and whatnot well you know what i'm i'll see if i can talk to them over there and see if we can't get that through because i'd love to think about the rodeos and i think that's a great topic man and gang gang and i appreciate you sending that in brother and you know it's so funny when i was in new york city man i met a police officer and his hair his his his his horse had a haircut same as mine and i said is that your horse and he said yeah yeah that's my horse i'm on it and so i figured you know probably was his and then i said well who cut his hair and he kind of looks around he's like i'll be honest i kind of fucked it up i was like i didn't think he was going to be him i was doing it though man but i appreciate that honesty and the horse looked a little shy

Like that's sometimes my that's one of my issues with god is bruh Bake another batch daddy You know, you got all the capabilities you got You know, I'd love to see like kind of a unicorn that has Uh Wi-Fi in its horn that's got that fucking hard hitter on the top that router Wouldn't that be great? You can't get Wi-Fi, but suddenly One of these unicorns shows up And dude think about a unicorn. That's another thing. You don't notice how much magic is in it. That's another type of corn if Dude, imagine the first unicorn walks up You know, somebody shot that bitch down, right? You know what I'm saying? I mean in no offense, man, but somebody really pop that cat down boy. If you saw a unicorn show up, you were like damn boy I mean, there's no way you couldn't think this horse Is trying to fuck boy This horse is trying to In my butt You know, this horse is into the dark arts. There's no way you couldn't think that But it's interesting how much magic is in the unicorn. They're probably top six magic animals I think anyway, if you had to think about it Um, I don't even know what we're talking about Uh, but yeah, imagine that first unicorn rolls up. Do you sit in there with your buddy? Maybe you guys are having a couple garbanzo beans or You know trying to get rid of yellow fever or whatever. I don't know. I don't even know what you're doing You know trying to get rid of yellow fever or whatever. I don't know. I don't even know what year it was when they showed up And next thing, you know, this bad bitch rolls up with that, but hell With that freaking That top piece, baby A unicorn is basically like a shark It's like the shark of horses and But they got magic in them You never know how much magic is in a unicorn by looking at it. You just think damn this horse is really honestly probably Trying to meet some local men You know, we're trying to do or trying to pick a lock or something Or what else are trying to just, you know, push a button on an elevator or What else I don't even know what a horse would do with that horn on its head You know hang out just maybe hang laundry, but like just one shirt But you don't realize when you see that unicorn how much how much power is in them and how much magic full of magic You just don't know man.

It was time to regroup Um, but yeah, it was good, man. It was a good experience, man. Yeah, man. Thanks for stepping in dude. I'm sorry. I forgot my computer It's all good. It's all good. We got multiple here. So yeah, good, man Uh, yeah, let's get into some of the calls and um, and then if you have some news stuff, let's let's uh, change the vibe A little bit today. Cool. Cool. Uh, yeah this first one Uh, we had a couple people calling about this the sacramento sound like the sacramento people got a little rowdy Oh, yeah. Yeah, they had a couple Um, well here they got a call. Yep. All right Hey, p.m. This is tony from sacramento big tony show big tony. Thank you for calling in this and tony Short for anthony, I guess What else you think? big tony maybe Those are pretty much antonio antonio. Yep. There you go spanish tony. Um Onward I was at your show last night. I was at your later show last night And then I just don't feel Very good about my city. We were kind of rude to you. I think and um And I had to tell like like five people to shut up and it was distracting And I had one of the balcony seats And throughout the whole show there wasn't a single time when anyone was just sitting down And trying to and just watching the show trying to enjoy it at any given point for the whole damn thing dude There was like At least two or three people milling about if not more It was distracting and it was hard to enjoy your show And if it was distracting for me, I can only imagine how distracting it was for you So we were not very nice to you that that night and uh, I want to apologize man And I hope you still want to come back and see us Yeah, man. Well, look, I appreciate the call. Yeah, that's that the friday night show that was there was Yeah, some guy was yelling He kept yelling out at one point he's yelling. I think at like one of his wives or something I don't know what was going on. He might have been saudi arabian and they carry a couple wives Like you'll ask a saudi like a saudi raven got reaching his pocket and i'm fucking accidentally drop a couple wives out, you know um But you know what I did notice that there were constantly people just walking around I mean sacramento also. Let's be honest dude. It's got that Sort of a lot of missing people kind of You know like a lot of a lot of missing people are in sacramento So i'm amazed sometimes and more people don't know that so if you're missing somebody Go there and that's where they are I mean, it's a lot of people you've seen on posters and stuff. They're in sacramento missing animal sacramento can't find my has anybody seen my wallet sacramento it's all there man, um And I just feel bad for the people that's at the show that's trying to enjoy themselves, you know That's the part that gets me a little bit, but but uh, but thank you for the call man. You know, it gets What I don't what makes it tough for me is that I want People to enjoy the show And so if somebody's all wasted and they're just acting like a donkey Then that really It doesn't help So i'm trying to keep the show kind of undunkeyed and keep it tight But I appreciate the call tony even though that guy Said that and there were a couple other people that called in about some of the rowdy members in the crowd Everybody said they still like really enjoyed the show and you killed and it didn't affect their time This guy he was in the balcony a little further away, but most people said they just had an amazing time It was still a great show. They're just like some people can't act right dang Yeah, you know, it's funny and I think we learned that as we go along. It's like You know somebody always can't act right And that is why it's like And that but that's just what it is, you know, and I got to learn also to just vibe better with it You know, I can't control everything. It's going to happen and some people just aren't going to act right sometimes Fortunately, we were able to you know, some of the people to toss them out And then get back on and then get the wheels back going But what's tough for me is that there's a good flow to the show and if it's really flowing and somebody gets really Don't get out Then it you know, it kind of kicks the whole show in the ass a little So but thank you for your call. Tony. I appreciate it, man Here's a patreon question actually this Along the same lines and this is Cara. She said how do you keep yourself amped up for your tour performances? When you're doing the same thing so often so many times for different people gang Thank you, Cara First your support on patreon and and for this question. Um You know, it's been tough and I've actually been talking to other comedians about it, you know I was talking to Sebastian man of scalco about it the other day and And just asking him, you know, how do you keep the material fresh And because I was having some trouble with it a little bit this year Especially the shows in new york city. I was really just burnt out like I don't want to just get up there and be like a record player or something that Just kind of starts and just goes through the stuff You know, I want to be in the moment. I want it to be kind of feel like a new experience for the people And uh, and and and I just got reminded of that actually the past two weeks I just started thinking man, you know, I have to have fun in what I'm doing You know, and I've noticed that for myself over this year even just Sometimes I'm just not enjoying it, but it's just because I'm not making that choice like I it's up to me if I have fun or not That's up to me You know life's gonna throw curveballs and sliders and sometimes it's gonna run up It's just gonna run all the way from the pitchers man and just put a ball right in your ass, dude Not even a pitch What is that? But it's like it's it's how I I choose how I meet the world And it's almost the same thing for these shows. It's like I choose if I If I just get caught up in letting things just run in a circle And I don't try to show up and just recognize. Hey tonight is a new experience We could have a new joke come out of this evening. We could have a new moment We could embrace what's going on. We could talk about what's happening in the city Um Like I actually started off the show. I didn't realize this in Vegas with You know Ari had went up before me and there was another real funny young fella named bruce that went up And I was like man, it's nice to have two white guys in a theater without guns, huh? And uh, and it was funny. It was crazy But I didn't realize it, but it got a big laugh out of the beginning And it got everybody kind of in the vibe and I didn't know that was gonna happen that I was gonna say that um But some of the stories I just try and keep my attitude open like Hey, like like I'm telling it to a friend for the first time. Hey, let me have fun telling this Because even though it's maybe the hundredth time I've told some of them. It's the first time you're gonna hear it And so if I make it not about myself and I make it about the people that are there You know, hey, this is their first time to hear this Um, that helps now with that said it does get hard to do it over and over again Yeah, it gets hard some jokes. It's like the punchline and almost It's like screeching out of you. Don't even want it to you don't even want to say it What was some of the advice from Sebastian? Oh, Sebastian's suggesting that you kind of change it He's like, you know move it Change the doing it I don't even that's there's there's this whole advice. What do you say, bro? He's like, yeah So it's a bastion the other day told me he was taking adult swim lessons And it blew my mind Um, but he'll be on here this week and I'm gonna bring this question back up with him carrot Nick if you'll remind me to help do that. We'll do um Let's take another call what came in Uh, so last week we had the gentleman called in Uh, he actually had two voicemails the first one. He was feeling pretty down feeling overwhelmed by all his student loans He called in and uh, said he had a better attitude about it But we got some some responses to your advice to him to just like write it out pay as low as you can keep lowering the payments Um, and we got some responses to that. Okay, cool. Yeah, that's this is pretty uh, I'm curious to see what some people thought Thanks. Here's the first one This is Tyler from Birmingham, Alabama So gang gang gang gang gang, brother. I'll see you next week, man August 15th at the start on so looking forward to that but uh, anyway, I just wanted to call about the guy who had a Who was kind of down on himself about the student loan debt. You have some good points um A couple things that I've heard One student loan debt is the best line of credit to have So, you know, it's not a bad thing to have on your on your credit line And you can make the minimum payments. You don't use there's a timeline in order to pay it back And I have a old friend that told me one time that uh, you know, if you if you die before you pay it all back Then you win so I mean no rush to pay all that shit back That's hilarious, dude. Yeah, that's a go man. Look Look, if that's the case go get your master's buddy, man Um, that's a good suggestion. What do you think about that, Nick? Yeah, I mean, I'm kind of of two minds like It doesn't hurt your credit score. It's not going to hurt you like getting a house or whatever but Part of me is like, oh you took out an agreement You should work to pay it back even we look at as like the government. Oh, they're not going to miss it But still like just part of me is like you should honor your debts. Yeah Wow, man, it's very um I haven't been doing it. It's very Ned Stark of you very Ned Stark move when it comes to uh, Well, you haven't been doing it though. Yeah. Yeah, I've been doing the whole push it off push it off I mean it was always I would do the things they they look at your income So the lower your payments and I've been doing doing that whole thing but now that now I'd like to You start shipping away at least or at least make the regular minimum payments to get on some type of Forseeable plan where it's getting paid off, but I would feel like an idiot if they get wept away Yeah, I mean companies do you know, it is interesting how we all think or sometimes we think like yeah Just because it's a big company or it's the government. It's like we don't really owe them It's almost like this invisible thing. It just keeps that will just keep working Um And that yeah, we don't think sometimes like that we made this agreement like we clicked on the square or whatever and filled it in And then said submit And you're using whatever they gave us or you know and then And then we When it comes to it later, we're it's like, oh, fuck it's like almost so it will we forget that that yeah, we We put our name on the line, you know that we have some integrity in it. Um It's interesting, man. I definitely could say that over my life I remember the first cell phone bill ever got It was like seven thousand dollars, right? I didn't realize you couldn't just use your phone as much as you wanted I thought I got this bitch, man. I had a hundred minutes, dude. Okay Like a hundred minutes when cell phones came out It was just enough minutes To really realize you don't you you cannot afford a cell phone, man Every call you had to be like, hey, it was almost like you were in that movie where you have like, uh, there's like a timer And it's gonna blow up or something. So it was like, uh, every call that came in Oh, you'd have to try and get it. Remember you remember that you used to like write it about 50 seconds You'd be looking back. All right, man, we get a my first cell phone plan I was late to the game because I had to pay for my own cell phone high school was um Was unlimited they had already moved into those types type plans It was it was a benefit of waiting. But yeah, I mean my grandma was always worried about her minutes, uh, man, she would nights and weekends That's what you get Because boy, they'd be like, look, man, I can't call you till after 9 p.m So if you had a friend that was in any other time zone as a kid, you was fucked. He was not friends anymore Did you before cell phones, uh, play the collect call game? Um, I would I would have to collect call to go get picked up And uh, yes, I'd be at the Y and it'd be like It's nick. I'm done And my grandma would come and pick me up 15 minutes later. Yeah, man. That was awesome That was always a good move and the movie theater game like they had to click over So how if I was gonna have a if I was gonna have a girl call me back late at night I would say, okay, you know at about 9 20 I'ma call a movie theater line Because they had like a 40 minute message on there and it was like Now showing this weekend at seven, uh, the bodyguard starring Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner Showtimes are Monday through Friday 5 p.m. And 7 p.m. Saturday matinee 2 p.m. And 4 30 p.m Saturday and sunday evening 5 7 and 9 p.m Then it would be like now showing in uh theater 2 and then it would go on to the next movie, you know Land before time Wow, this young dinosaur doesn't know what's gonna occur Starring the voices of you know Lou Diamond Phillips and it would just keep going so it'd be like a 40 minute message So if you had that call waiting then you could hear someone calling you the beep and it wouldn't ring in your house Gotcha So it'd be like, all right. I'm just gonna call the movie theater and hope she called now sometimes Your girl would fall asleep, you know Because bitches be resting everybody knows that dude if you go looking at nine bitches It's probably about two of them's resting. So then you just heard the entire movie schedule three or four times And then in my in my dreams that night. It was just the background loop. It was just just Me eating popcorn, you know Um What was his question? What was this about? Uh, he was just kind of reiterating your sentiment about the student loans Just yeah keep dragging it out. Yeah, keep dragging it out. That's a good But also, yeah, the the the thing we forget so though sometimes that yeah, we made a deal, you know, we did make a deal Um, man big companies do get kind of fun. Everybody just thinks they can fuck them. Mm-hmm But they also fuck people every chance they get and probably probably goes unnoticed But that doesn't mean we have to act like that. Right, right Yeah, man, it's it's a real battle. God. I remember. Oh, I remember I'd send letters to Verizon I was like, man, fuck y'all, bro. Dude. I remember sending pictures of me from photographs of me with like this With my hands in the air holding my pockets. I like I have no money I would seven thousand dollars, dude So and somebody oh, I remember this was the worst somebody kept calling me from africa, bro And I don't know how they got my number I don't know how africa even got a phone at this point. Like I didn't know they had even had a phone in africa But they kept calling me and I would get charged when I answered it, you know, did you guys talk? Huh, did you guys talk? Yeah, sometimes it was so hard to know what was going on, bro. It's africa, dude I mean africa is pretty wild and imagine africa on the phone Maybe it was that you know what I'm saying? If africa called, bro I'm not saying don't answer, bro. But you know Maybe, you know, just maybe don't answer every time. Exactly. Okay Uh, let's take another call, man. All right. This one is, uh, who is listening? Oh, good. You're always asking who's listening. Yeah, my man. It's your boy bo from indiana big bo indiana, dude, and that is uh That is spanish for indian first of all and also beautiful place, dude You know sort of hit or miss out there in the middle of america.

Yeah, brennan has a very rare rare look, man One of the best things I've ever heard about brennan. I read this on a On comment somewhere brennan looks like the kind of guy that rides with both of his legs off the same side of a horse That was good I like the one at one of the first roast my host on king of the sting one of the segments Uh, you guys do on that show. It was he looks like a Puerto Rican baseball coach.

Stay safe out there, brother And thank you for the call Dude, I was thinking before you came in here man. I was talking about I was thinking about potential Do you whenever you're grown up, did you feel like you had a lot of potential neck or what what does potential mean if I think about that? What does it mean? Yeah, just the ability to do More than what you're currently doing kind of and uh, I I always thought I did. Um Yeah, I was always really unsure of what I was going to try But like I just felt like when I compared myself to other people I was just like I'm better Or like I would see better, but I would see people in positions where they are. I was like, well, I could do that Kind of at least right because that's a good point. I could do that at least Right, so I have potential to do that maybe more than that or something. Yeah, or an advanced state of that Yeah, I just been thinking I was thinking about potential earlier And just like where does like potential come from or what is it, you know? um We'll look it up. Will you mind looking it up potential? I'm gonna think about it real quick uh Yeah, I guess the a bit you could Because people that's one thing that people I mean, I guess people can recognize your potential people say that a lot, you know Or you know, you'll hear that term I'll recognize your potential Oh, what does it say brother? Having or showing the capacity to become or develop into something in the future. Hmm Yeah, because I was thinking about popcorn at the beginning of this and how you don't have I know think about that, dude Popcorn you would never guess it's in there. Mm-hmm You would never guess it dude if you looked at it If you looked at a corn Bro, and you wrote down 200 things that could be in there. Uh-huh. None of them would be popcorn All the things I wrote down would be smaller than what's in that Right, so that's kind of potential, you know Yeah, man, I guess that you know, what's funny? I guess I see potential in people. I guess if you see if you could if It's really kind of cool if you can see if you do see if you see potential in somebody. That's kind of like a neat Way to look at people. I think I'm I don't do it all the time for sure. I'll forget about it a lot But looking for somebody's potential Yeah, I wonder if you have I wonder if potential is something that other people have to say Oh, I feel like you have potential Or if somebody tells you that it definitely makes you feel good. Yeah, that's a big compliment or that's a big thing because it makes you feel Motivated that you can do more I think a lot of potential is mindset and You can get that mindset from like other people reinforcing it Telling you and then you're like, oh, I can do this and so then you give an attempt at it But like if you don't I think that's why like there's kind of like a malaise in like poor neighborhoods or whatever People don't think they have the potential to escape But when someone from their area Ends up succeeding there. They see oh, that's possible for me too and it opens up a world of possibilities Yeah Yeah, that potential when you see somebody doing something And it makes you feel like oh, I can do that. I could be that guy. Yeah, it almost ignites a part of you. That's I wonder from the future. There'll be a medicine that or something that That makes your potential kind of flare up, you know or just reminds you that you have it I guess I need to just remember that just trying to notice people's potential more Um Yeah, I don't think I do a good job of that sometimes I think I could probably do better because I think if you let people know, man, you have a lot of potential You know, I really see this potential and even call out things. They do That really makes people feel good, huh? Yeah, you know when people do that I've noticed just in my own life and people say that Especially like if an older person says that to you when you're younger and stuff, man, you have so much you have so much potential You know, I really see so much potential in you You know, I really see so much potential in you. Uh Anyway Yeah, I was just thinking about popcorn earlier. Um Let me say this man.

I think almost everything's sold out except for the second show in Biloxi in uh in Birmingham Uh Do you think I recognize your potential nick or not? Yeah, be honest man. I think so. I mean I think just in the position you gave me. I mean there's You need the potential to be able to do do it So yeah, I think so and we talk about future plans and some of the stuff we can accomplish So yeah, that gets me encouragement that you see it into me. Yeah Cool, man Yeah, I think but yeah, tell me more how much potential I have Come on, uh Let me think man. I think um I think you I think you definitely exceeded my expectations Oh, thank you. Thank you. And I don't mean that in a bad way or anything You know, uh But yeah, I mean, I think there's times Yeah, you definitely exceed exceed my expectations when I know when I'm in a place of like Feeling grateful. I usually I'll often think man. I'm grateful for nick, you know, oh, thanks, man So the hard part for me sometimes is just just getting in that place of gratitude generally Um But I think when you tell someone uh that they do a potential to there's part of them like You on the receiving end to it, you want to live up to that so it like makes you work harder Right, you're like, oh, he's I better I better live up to those expectations or or thoughts he has so you work harder. So yeah, um Just in general telling that to people can help. Yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, I could see that Yeah, I can see that's probably how like why some teachers are good and stuff like that Because when they make a student feel that way I think sometimes you just don't know like what's You know sometimes you but sometimes a teacher could say that a million times you can say it for years and none of them ever kind of Cracked the surface it just doesn't land And then every now and then you'll it's just it's almost like a it has to be a certain matchup too between two people and time You know when it when it really when you're willing to hear it as well and it really lands on you and you get inspired Um I think also uh One thing we've done And I think it's like each other pushing each other this podcast keeps evolving in a number of ways because we're always It doesn't have to be the same week to week and I think that's that's part of it. Yeah No, well, that's I mean that's good to hear because I know yeah, it's like um Yeah, I think sometimes I I want to like Try things different. I get like a little bit afraid I guess um But yeah, I think yeah, there is some evolution, you know, we've moved to some different studios um You know, we've taken You know, it's a lot of times where I'll just take your suggestion I feel like I do you ever feel like you can't make suggestions and stuff never that's that's An awesome thing about working in this environment. Yeah, we can Say whatever they sometimes they're used sometimes they're not but I mean with this whole studio like our layout and stuff We we went back and forth and it became it's a mishmash of both our our kind of visions for it Yeah, yeah, that's true. Huh? It's taken a little bit longer than I thought It's been a learning process for me just kind of a project management like because like basically what's holding us up now We've got construction people ready to go put putting cords But I'm trying to talk to engineers who are taking longer than I thought And and in the future that stuff before we even got the contractor in here I would have had everything finished and that's like what's holding stuff at the moment But I mean we're still functional, but I want to be like plug-and-play Yeah, and it would make my job easier because we're moving stuff back and forth for the guest episodes to the solo episodes and stuff And eventually you'll get a lot easier No, that's good to hear man. Yeah, I think uh Yeah, it's um Yeah, it's been crazy in here, man. It's been definitely been unique. I mean it's just coming along. It's just Uh, and you've done a lot of it man. Thank you very much. No problem um All right, let's get into a couple more a couple more calls. I'm sorry that I forgot the computer today guys But I'm glad we have a little bit of a change of pace man. It takes a little stress off of me I've just been feeling stressed and uh You know and I know I say that all the time and it but some of it's just like You know once we started king in the sting and then you know doing this past weekend twice a week sometimes with gas It's just a lot of output and then in my head I started thinking man. I'm boring people and there's nothing to talk about or um So it's good to have a change of pace, you know, and it's good to have somebody in here and it's interesting to talk about potential man It's interesting to talk about You know how you and I interact too. We've never really just we discuss it some But yes, sometimes I feel like I could do a better job I mean I know it like sometimes I'll get pissed I wake up in the morning pissed and the first person the only person That works for me is you so the only person I could fuck a ticket out on is you um So I'm sure that gets stressful man. What's that like to deal with? I kind of have like a mantra. I'm like Don't let other people's mood affect mine like go in just go in with the same attitude every day try to try to Be positive and like work harder But like like I said, don't don't let other people's like energy mess up my energy come in positive and like focused Yeah, and and just do that every day Kind of like you said you don't uh last week It was all about expectations and stuff and like I can't have expectations for the people who work around me I can just know if I'm doing my job Sincerely, I'm attempting the best I can then I just got to let other stuff slide off my back. Yeah Well, thanks for letting us out of your back some times man. I usually if I feel like I'm out of line I try to come back and I feel like I usually get around pretty quick on like bringing it bringing that up Yeah, yeah, and letting you know if I feel like I was you know, you know rude or You know um But yeah, man, you're just like the only person in my you know You're the closest person in my life in some instances. So you fucking gotta hear all this shit. I feel you but I don't know. I none of it is like I put myself in your shoes like your life over the past 18 months like it it's it's fucking it's wild Yeah, it's it's completely different. You're like you're gonna sell like 150,000 tickets or whatever this month like yeah this year or this year And yeah, that's crazy that that's a wild thought and like looking at your tour schedule for fall It's wild and I'm sure just looking at what's ahead That is where the stress comes from not as much as like what you're doing in the moment. It's just knowing It's like a sisyphian battle. It's always uphill. Yeah Yeah, it's always yeah, it's it's definitely been interesting. And so then it's just learning who I am in those spaces, you know and learning like You know and learning that there's some things I like about me in those in those as this Things has gotten busier and there's some things that I don't um You know, one of the things that is sometimes but my mood the mood that I wait, you know When I get agitated if things aren't a certain way and stuff, but I appreciate you putting up with me, man No problem. No, but I definitely see a lot of your potential, man and Um, you know, I know I'm fortunate to be able to work with you. Thanks, brother I feel fortunate as well. I think you have the potential to be the biggest comedy star in the world. So Thanks, man. Only going up. You're gonna be selling out msg like uh, Sebastian What motto sonium glute glutamate that's shit that's fucking killing Asians, bro You're gonna quit comedy and start selling chemicals. I could see that, bro God, I would be good to Just roll around with a big tank of it on the truck Um, come over here boy. Let me get a couple squirts of this under your tongue. It sells itself. Yeah, it really does Bro, it's so good. Dude. If you order just msg, bro from israel or one of these other places, bro Fuck the food man. Fuck the bok choy dog. Just put this shit under your tongue dog and look for the lord All right, let's take another question or two, man. All right Hey, pio. Um, my name's Sophia. I was born with a condition that um affects Every system on my body and I have been chronically ill my entire life. Oh god. I think I had that I think it was my mother actually when I was young. Um, and now it's just myself bothering every system on my body Um, I'm sorry to hear about that. I appreciate your call. Uh, and thank you for sharing that with us. What's going on? and some of the main symptoms are Uh, overwhelming sadness and anxiety and things that really keep me from being able to socialize very well And uh, I'm about to go to a concert and I I don't get out of the house much. So I uh I'm stressing being around people and I'm fearing judgment. I just watched your podcast um where you talked about Thinking about what other people are thinking about you and When I got out in public, I had to I have to do a lot of things to be able to take care of myself and sometimes I worry What other people think of me? and it's really stressful so um knowing, you know, that there's other people out there that are going through that same thing Goddamn To anybody else out there with chronic illness whether or not, you know, you have it what's going on in your body know that you're not alone and that It's always okay to express your emotions and it's always okay to tell some Monday You have to set back. Yeah, that's your boundaries um Thank you so much deal. I adore you dang dang Well, thanks for the sweet, uh, call. Yeah, I could definitely feel Yeah, it makes me it makes me You know, it makes me think that you're pretty brave to call And share that You know, that takes a lot of bravery I mean it makes you feel like you're on the front lines of your own emotions and feelings and you're battling that and that anxiety Yeah, it's so tough You know, you go somewhere and you think that everybody already doesn't like you before they get there and they've already made this decision in their in their heads or You know, you just get so scared of like just being out and about and You know, I get scared of looking people's eyes sometimes because I feel like they knew that I was They could see something inside of me that was wrong and I didn't even know what it was and Or they could see that I was weak or I don't know. I just Yeah, I just I know that that's really painful um And I know that that's really brave though of you You know and to to to say look, you know, I'm still I'm gonna pack up who I am And I'm gonna go and I'm gonna go see this band or I'm gonna go and and and and apply for this job or I'm gonna go and and uh And I'm just gonna take action um And you know, it's so funny when you we play the beginning of the call again, Nick Hey, Theo. Um, my name is Sophia. I was born with a condition that, um, affects Every system of my body and I have been chronically ill my entire life and some of the main symptoms are Uh, overwhelming sadness and anxiety and things that really keep me from being able to socialize very well And uh, I'm about to go to a concert and I'm about to go to a concert and I I don't get out of the house much. So I uh, I'm stressing being around people and I'm fearing judgment. I just watched Yeah, there's really you really hit you really hit me in the heart right there um Yeah, because you're just fearing judgment And you know why it kind of makes me sad. I think when I really think about it, I can relate to that But it also makes me sad because I know that I'm judgmental sometimes You know, I know that I'm As much as I don't want to be I I am You know that I judge others because it makes me feel a little bit separate And that distance that space gives me the space I need to then Put up my guard and to be okay, you know And uh, you know and you calling and saying that I think it reminds me that That I can always be of service somehow if I'm at a concert if I'm walking down the hall if I am No matter what I'm doing. I can always be of service to someone Or I always there's always an opportunity Because there's you're probably going to be, you know, a lot of other people at the concert And none of them may know what you're going through may know But some of somebody may get a feeling when they're around you. Oh, maybe I should just check in with this part See how they're doing or just, you know, it's like, uh You know, you are an opportunity for other people to Express the best part of themselves You know a part that's very caring um And man, what if god made you as a gift like a god made you is this basically this opportunity that's wandering around You know that you have this opportunity like you are this opportunity that when people You know when people care and show that you know reach out to you or somebody like you or just let Help you to feel okay that That they are thinking it feels so good about themselves And so that's really wild because you that's like a You have the potential oddly to make people feel really good Because if people know that you're struggling and then they're they're able to You know, just help be a part of a little bit more of your joy or comfort Then that's really going to make them realize a potential that they didn't have inside of themselves. Um What do you think Nick Yeah, she has the potential to make other people feel good about themselves and other people who are in her same position her Facing these fears and going out into public It shows other people who are suffering from whatever she is that they can do it too and you can live A fulfilling life and not let whatever ailment you have Hold you back. Yeah Yeah, it's so crazy how we've gotten so trapped inside of ourselves a little bit. Um You know, I do believe that the cure all for everything Can be helping others And if you can find a way in your life And even in those moments when you are struggling the most and most anxious and everything To just try and be of helpful to someone else that I think for it can offer you some peace where we where we don't think about ourselves You know, when we're thinking about somebody else, it's really hard to think about ourselves. Um, it's really almost impossible um But yeah, I just appreciate I just appreciate you calling because You know, you just reminded me of uh Of feelings you reminded me of feelings and that people have them and that we're all struggling somehow You know, we're all struggling. We're all struggling somehow and for you to be brave enough to say that and share it Man for some reason and some weird space inside of me or not even a weird space, but an okay space. It makes me feel Like there's hope You know, it makes me feel hopeful Because if you can share that you feel that way Then then I know that it's okay for me to feel that way a little bit and when I acknowledge that I feel sometimes like So worried about what other people are thinking or I feel so afraid or I feel You know, like people are judging me so much and there's nothing that I can do that's ever gonna make Me feel okay Me feel okay When I feel those, you know When I feel some of those things that Man, I lost my train of thought, but I really was enjoying being on the tracks. Um When you share that you're not feeling well It activates a part of me inside of me That also has the same fears and same uncertainty And maybe not the same level of illness that you suffer from but part of it A little of it. I can really relate And when I can relate it makes me feel not alone And so thank you because you did that for me a little bit, you know, you You made me feel a little bit more okay to uh To be brave even if I'm not. Okay. Um You're a sweetheart and I hope you had fun at the concert and when I come close I hope you'll come out and be my guest at my show and uh And just thank you because you just I just needed something today to make my life feel You know, I know it selfish, but I just needed something to Remind me about what's important and that's each other and um, and you just did that for me. So Man or lady. Sorry You You doing more than you know Be good to yourself. You know, you deserve it. I know that And I'm gonna try doing the same thing for myself And we can do it. You know, we can do it Um, that's kind of the episode I guess today neck. How do you feel man? Thanks for coming in here.

Is it like an island treat kind of? Is it pretty\"},{\"currTime\":127,\"text\":\"common there in Costa Rica? No, I think a lot of rural people eat it\"},{\"currTime\":132,\"text\":\"occasionally, but a lot of people think it's gross and definitely don't eat it\"},{\"currTime\":136,\"text\":\"too. Oh, yeah, it's kind of interesting. It's almost like when I was growing up,\"},{\"currTime\":141,\"text\":\"people would eat a lot of hogs head cheese and stuff, and where my\"},{\"currTime\":147,\"text\":\"sister lived, they cook cracklins a lot of times, where they'll just take a\"},{\"currTime\":150,\"text\":\"bunch of fat and put it in a pot. That's the best. Yeah. At the beginning, you're\"},{\"currTime\":153,\"text\":\"like, where's the meat, you know? And then by the end, you're just like, left\"},{\"currTime\":157,\"text\":\"with these pieces of fried leather. Oh, and they look, yeah, and they're just\"},{\"currTime\":160,\"text\":\"sort of tasty, really, and airy. They're almost just, it's almost like, they're\"},{\"currTime\":165,\"text\":\"almost like cotton candy, like the inverse of cotton candy. Oh, yeah,\"},{\"currTime\":168,\"text\":\"yeah. Cracklins. Pretty far on the other end of the spectrum. So, so, so when you\"},{\"currTime\":173,\"text\":\"go up to, when you go to Alaska, what part of Alaska are you in? In the Arctic, so\"},{\"currTime\":178,\"text\":\"north of the Brooks Range, I'm at a science station. Can you pull that up,\"},{\"currTime\":181,\"text\":\"Nick, the Brooks Range? We could see that. I just want to have an idea where you\"},{\"currTime\":185,\"text\":\"are. Yeah, about 370 miles north of Fairbanks. Yeah, and I don't even know\"},{\"currTime\":190,\"text\":\"where Fairbanks is, dude. How far from Phoenix? But I'm gonna know. Give me an\"},{\"currTime\":194,\"text\":\"idea. The state looks like this, you know? These are the Aleutian Islands. Fairbanks\"},{\"currTime\":199,\"text\":\"kind of right in the middle, and I'm up towards the top there. Okay. Yeah, so I'm\"},{\"currTime\":204,\"text\":\"above north of that mountain range. Oh, wow. So that's called the North Slope up\"},{\"currTime\":209,\"text\":\"there. That's where there's a lot of oil business going on, and the Arctic\"},{\"currTime\":214,\"text\":\"National Wildlife Refuge. So it's, I mean, you're, you are up there. Yeah, it's about a\"},{\"currTime\":219,\"text\":\"10-hour drive to get up to where I work. And if you go off the top, say you get to\"},{\"currTime\":224,\"text\":\"the top of Alaska and you take a boat north, what do you hit? The North Pole?\"},{\"currTime\":228,\"text\":\"Eventually some ice. Really? Yeah. You can, you can't really access the coast there\"},{\"currTime\":233,\"text\":\"without paying for a permit from the oil company to go on a tour. You can go on\"},{\"currTime\":239,\"text\":\"like an hour-long tour where you get to dip your toes in the Arctic Ocean, but\"},{\"currTime\":243,\"text\":\"they don't want people messing around up there. So you can't just access it on\"},{\"currTime\":248,\"text\":\"your own. They kind of own the whole North Coast line there. So they, so it's\"},{\"currTime\":252,\"text\":\"private property? Yeah, yeah. There's a town called Dead Horse up there. It's not\"},{\"currTime\":256,\"text\":\"really much of a town. It's like an industrial outpost where everything's\"},{\"currTime\":260,\"text\":\"made of metal and there's just testosterone in the air. It's a rough\"},{\"currTime\":264,\"text\":\"place. It's ugly. But you can see some cool birds up there,\"},{\"currTime\":268,\"text\":\"spectacle-liters and phalloropes and king-iters and stuff. That's pretty cool.\"},{\"currTime\":273,\"text\":\"Now are those birds that are indeed, they're only there? Spectacle-liters, yeah,\"},{\"currTime\":278,\"text\":\"are real Arctic specialists. They didn't even really know where they spent the\"},{\"currTime\":282,\"text\":\"winter until pretty recently. The whole population goes to like an opening in the\"},{\"currTime\":286,\"text\":\"ice out in the Bering Sea, I think. How do you say it? Spectacle-liters, E-I-D-E-R.\"},{\"currTime\":293,\"text\":\"And when you were up there, like how close are you getting to these birds? Like\"},{\"currTime\":297,\"text\":\"what do you do? Too close. My job, I'm a naturalist for the science station up\"},{\"currTime\":304,\"text\":\"there and so every day I'm out there just trying to document what's happening\"},{\"currTime\":307,\"text\":\"with wildlife, when the bird species arrive to the area, when they leave in\"},{\"currTime\":312,\"text\":\"the fall, and then other wildlife, you know, there's bears and wolves and\"},{\"currTime\":315,\"text\":\"wolverines and stuff up there. So I'm just out there spending time trying to\"},{\"currTime\":319,\"text\":\"see what's going on and document it, just for posterity, basically. Oh, wow,\"},{\"currTime\":323,\"text\":\"that's a beautiful bird, yeah. Yeah, so it's a sea duck and they just breed on the\"},{\"currTime\":330,\"text\":\"coast in grassy ponds and then spend the winter out among the sea ice and openings.\"},{\"currTime\":335,\"text\":\"Can you get a picture of the head again, Nick? Look at that thing. Wow. Yeah,\"},{\"currTime\":343,\"text\":\"what? And so what is that coming off the back and almost looks like gills up\"},{\"currTime\":347,\"text\":\"there by its head, is that? What is that? It's just feathering? Yeah, just weird feathers.\"},{\"currTime\":351,\"text\":\"And can you have one of these at the house or these more? These, you got to get\"},{\"currTime\":355,\"text\":\"some special permits for that. Yeah, they don't they don't take kindly. I think\"},{\"currTime\":359,\"text\":\"it's a threatened species probably. Wow. There's just not that many of them and\"},{\"currTime\":363,\"text\":\"they breed in really specific areas. And can you watch them fight or they don't\"},{\"currTime\":368,\"text\":\"fight? What do they do? They seem pretty docile to me. They're just kind of sitting\"},{\"currTime\":371,\"text\":\"around on the water, minding their own business. Yeah. It's, you know, Arctic\"},{\"currTime\":375,\"text\":\"summer is really short and so the birds kind of have to get there and get on\"},{\"currTime\":379,\"text\":\"with it, get the breeding done and then get the hell out of there. So and that's\"},{\"currTime\":383,\"text\":\"when a lot of them do breeding is in the summertime? Yeah, pretty much only then.\"},{\"currTime\":386,\"text\":\"So we have like 110 species of birds we've observed in the area that are\"},{\"currTime\":392,\"text\":\"coming from the lower 48 states, Central America, South America, even all the way\"},{\"currTime\":397,\"text\":\"down to Antarctica, someone spend the winter down there. So birds kind of just\"},{\"currTime\":401,\"text\":\"come like everybody's kind of popping in. Yeah. Yeah. Who's kind of the randiest\"},{\"currTime\":405,\"text\":\"group, you know, because sometimes you're like on a plane to Vegas and you got\"},{\"currTime\":408,\"text\":\"different groups. You got a couple of German guys, you know. You got one guy\"},{\"currTime\":412,\"text\":\"making his own cocaine in the backseat. You know, you got a bunch of Italians\"},{\"currTime\":416,\"text\":\"just, just, just, you know, drinking Deca 200. You got guys really, what kind of\"},{\"currTime\":421,\"text\":\"group gets up there and just really just turns it out? There's a bird called the\"},{\"currTime\":425,\"text\":\"Blue Throat that is mostly a Eurasian bird and the population just barely\"},{\"currTime\":430,\"text\":\"extends over into Alaska. So you have, if you want to see him in the United States,\"},{\"currTime\":434,\"text\":\"you have to go up there. And they, yeah, look at that. They sing bird karaoke. They\"},{\"currTime\":440,\"text\":\"do like imitations of other bird species and they'll do this repertoire that goes\"},{\"currTime\":445,\"text\":\"on for, they can imitate up to like 25 species of other birds. But you hear, so\"},{\"currTime\":450,\"text\":\"you hear it, you hear them singing all this stuff, but it sounds a little off,\"},{\"currTime\":453,\"text\":\"like karaoke, where you're like, I don't think that's really the white crown\"},{\"currTime\":457,\"text\":\"sparrow and it's that guy. Oh, and so they're just kind of, they're like\"},{\"currTime\":461,\"text\":\"impersonators almost. Yeah, yeah, totally. And yeah, the females seem to get a kick\"},{\"currTime\":466,\"text\":\"out of the male with the biggest repertoire. And oh, wow. Pretty cool, huh?\"},{\"currTime\":472,\"text\":\"Yeah, it's cool. So bird, bird watchers. That that bird's like going to be like, I'm\"},{\"currTime\":476,\"text\":\"gonna go up there and, now can they, will they tempt other females from other\"},{\"currTime\":480,\"text\":\"species to come on over with, since they're using different people's songs?\"},{\"currTime\":484,\"text\":\"I haven't seen them tempt females, but other species will definitely get agitated\"},{\"currTime\":488,\"text\":\"if they hear another bird singing their song, because they, when birds sing,\"},{\"currTime\":492,\"text\":\"they're basically advertising their territory. So they sing on the edges of\"},{\"currTime\":496,\"text\":\"their territory and then the bird with the next territory over will hear it and\"},{\"currTime\":500,\"text\":\"he'll kind of establish his border. So they suddenly hear their own song in a\"},{\"currTime\":505,\"text\":\"place where they thought they had their territory staked out. Some of them\"},{\"currTime\":508,\"text\":\"definitely respond aggressively. So it's, so when a bird like sings, it's, it's\"},{\"currTime\":514,\"text\":\"always to let people know that this is my territory? That and I'm available. So\"},{\"currTime\":519,\"text\":\"they're singing to let the females know that they've got this pad and they're\"},{\"currTime\":524,\"text\":\"ready to roll. Oh, okay. Yeah. So I got a comfortable place here. I got a little\"},{\"currTime\":527,\"text\":\"spot at the days in or whatever. Got me a little spot at the Hampton Inn. Got it for\"},{\"currTime\":532,\"text\":\"the summer. Oh, wow. Gotta get out. Yeah. So those are the only two reasons. If you\"},{\"currTime\":536,\"text\":\"hear a bird, they're letting somebody know about their territory or they are\"},{\"currTime\":541,\"text\":\"letting females know that they're available. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. And is it\"},{\"currTime\":544,\"text\":\"just male birds that sing or female birds also sing? Mostly just male birds\"},{\"currTime\":549,\"text\":\"sing and females do little calls that they use to keep in touch with each\"},{\"currTime\":553,\"text\":\"other and to warn each other of predators and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Waiting for this one\"},{\"currTime\":558,\"text\":\"bitch to text me back right now. It's only been two weeks. So she's probably\"},{\"currTime\":564,\"text\":\"busy, you know, traveling or something. Yeah. How cold so when you get up to\"},{\"currTime\":570,\"text\":\"Alaska, man, how cold is it? Like because people think of Alaska and you know, like\"},{\"currTime\":576,\"text\":\"a lot of people you think of like gold country and that sort of thing. You\"},{\"currTime\":580,\"text\":\"think of it being cold. Is there a level where it doesn't matter that's cold\"},{\"currTime\":583,\"text\":\"anymore that you can't even like we can't even really feel a difference between\"},{\"currTime\":587,\"text\":\"say, you know, 20 degrees below and like 80 degrees below? 20 degrees below is not\"},{\"currTime\":593,\"text\":\"bad at all. When you get down to 40, I think 50 below is the lowest I've\"},{\"currTime\":598,\"text\":\"experienced. And then you're just in pain. You just don't want to be outside at all.\"},{\"currTime\":602,\"text\":\"And yeah. So down to minus 20, it's very dry up there, at least in Fairbanks. And\"},{\"currTime\":609,\"text\":\"so you can still go skiing and stuff and have an all right time. But when it gets\"},{\"currTime\":615,\"text\":\"colder than that, like you can feel a breeze coming underneath the bottom of\"},{\"currTime\":619,\"text\":\"your cabin door, just because the temperature difference is so great that\"},{\"currTime\":623,\"text\":\"the air is just like blowing in trying to equal it out. So explain that to me.\"},{\"currTime\":629,\"text\":\"Like, I don't know what you're talking about exactly. When there's differences in\"},{\"currTime\":633,\"text\":\"temperature, the air wind is basically air moving from one place to another,\"},{\"currTime\":639,\"text\":\"right? Okay, ridiculously simple way to describe when. Yeah, I get it. I think we\"},{\"currTime\":643,\"text\":\"all understand that. But like, when there's a big difference inside and\"},{\"currTime\":650,\"text\":\"outside, the air is trying to equalize to normal it out. Okay. So you have these\"},{\"currTime\":655,\"text\":\"like 10 inch thick walls of a cabin or even the doors are usually have several\"},{\"currTime\":660,\"text\":\"inches of insulation. But just at the bottom, the only space where there's a\"},{\"currTime\":665,\"text\":\"little bit of air, it's just blowing in like your pants will go like this in the\"},{\"currTime\":670,\"text\":\"wind if you're standing near the door. Because the air is coming in. It's so\"},{\"currTime\":674,\"text\":\"much colder outside than it is inside. If you have it, you know, 60 inside that\"},{\"currTime\":678,\"text\":\"it just creates wind just trying to rush that close to each other. Yeah, yeah. But\"},{\"currTime\":684,\"text\":\"when I get up there in early May, and that's when it's still winter a little\"},{\"currTime\":689,\"text\":\"bit, there's usually a few feet of snow on the ground. But it's already full\"},{\"currTime\":693,\"text\":\"daylight. So I don't see the sunset until September. So the sun's up the whole time\"},{\"currTime\":701,\"text\":\"when you get there from May. Yep. Yeah. Which, yeah, as I get older, it gets\"},{\"currTime\":705,\"text\":\"harder to be used to that. Like we have blackout curtains, you know, to try to\"},{\"currTime\":710,\"text\":\"make it dark and in my room and stuff. But it's you can't keep it out the light\"},{\"currTime\":714,\"text\":\"a little bit. So, so yeah, it's kind of still winter a little bit in early May.\"},{\"currTime\":719,\"text\":\"And that's when the birds start to arrive to the area. So I'm out there all day\"},{\"currTime\":722,\"text\":\"like just visiting the same types of habitat and trying to keep track of when\"},{\"currTime\":726,\"text\":\"each species arrives to the area. I look like a concierge almost. Yeah, just trying to\"},{\"currTime\":731,\"text\":\"help them get settled in. So you do that for years and years and years and then\"},{\"currTime\":736,\"text\":\"you have a nice record of exactly what was happening, you know, in any given year.\"},{\"currTime\":741,\"text\":\"And you can track changes over time. And that's kind of how the good kinds of\"},{\"currTime\":746,\"text\":\"science work where you're just, there's people studying really specific stuff up\"},{\"currTime\":750,\"text\":\"there about carbon release into the atmosphere and all that. But I'm just\"},{\"currTime\":754,\"text\":\"studying very basic like what are the animals doing. I really love that\"},{\"currTime\":758,\"text\":\"because I've just always been more of a generalist where I like being outside and\"},{\"currTime\":763,\"text\":\"just paying attention to stuff rather than have my nose in the tundra sniffing\"},{\"currTime\":767,\"text\":\"gases or whatever they're doing. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's not, you're not as much of a\"},{\"currTime\":771,\"text\":\"corporate hunter. Freelance. Yeah. When they, when you start to see like\"},{\"currTime\":781,\"text\":\"different patterns from birds, is there a time when you like really start to get\"},{\"currTime\":784,\"text\":\"scared? Like is there one species that you really start to pay attention to? Yeah,\"},{\"currTime\":788,\"text\":\"there's a couple times the birds have frightened me a little bit. There's a\"},{\"currTime\":792,\"text\":\"bird called a long-tailed yaeger that it's a seabird. Basically, it's kind of\"},{\"currTime\":798,\"text\":\"like a gullish tarnish type of bird, but they're a predatory seabird and they\"},{\"currTime\":804,\"text\":\"only come inland to breed on tundra. Yeah, that one. So they eat voles and\"},{\"currTime\":812,\"text\":\"lemmings and stuff and when there aren't a lot of lemmings or voles around, those\"},{\"currTime\":817,\"text\":\"populations kind of crash occasionally and when there's not any round, they'll\"},{\"currTime\":820,\"text\":\"just form groups of like 40 and just maraud around and one time I saw a group\"},{\"currTime\":824,\"text\":\"of 40 just coming over a hill and there was kind of a thundercloud in the\"},{\"currTime\":828,\"text\":\"distance and I was like, I didn't know that they did that yet. It's like, why are\"},{\"currTime\":831,\"text\":\"these 40 birds coming at me? They're pretty gnarly. Yeah. I thought maybe they\"},{\"currTime\":835,\"text\":\"teamed up when we're coming to get you. I thought there was a tsunami coming or\"},{\"currTime\":838,\"text\":\"something. Oh, wow. Yeah, you just, you spend enough time out there, you see weird\"},{\"currTime\":842,\"text\":\"things like that that most people, you know, don't know happen.

Yeah, I guess. Or like you\"},{\"currTime\":858,\"text\":\"could get clues from them, you know. Yeah, yeah, definitely. I learned a lot about\"},{\"currTime\":862,\"text\":\"us from watching them and I think that's one of the great things about doing\"},{\"currTime\":866,\"text\":\"that kind of work is just being out there and having the opportunity to be away\"},{\"currTime\":869,\"text\":\"from all the other noise that's going on and just watch other things and have\"},{\"currTime\":875,\"text\":\"time to think and yeah, I've been doing it for 17 years now.

The Mennonites are kind of\"},{\"currTime\":1108,\"text\":\"weird where they use cell phones. They don't use the internet, but they'll use cell phones. They\"},{\"currTime\":1113,\"text\":\"use motors and not like the Amish in that sense.

Grizzly bears, um, the occasional moose, musk ox, caribou,\"},{\"currTime\":2373,\"text\":\"those are the big ones. Um, which ones are the most friendly do you find to like, to humans?\"},{\"currTime\":2378,\"text\":\"Or even maybe overall, do you, or can animals, some of them can seem friendly, like a dog can\"},{\"currTime\":2382,\"text\":\"seem real friendly, you know? Yeah. Or any of those larger animals you see up there, um, friendly?\"},{\"currTime\":2387,\"text\":\"Caribou, uh, aren't unfriendly. You can trick them to come closer to you by putting your arms up\"},{\"currTime\":2395,\"text\":\"and it kind of looks like a pair of antlers and either their eyesight's not that good or they're\"},{\"currTime\":2399,\"text\":\"not that bright, but they'll start walking towards you wondering if they're going to fight you or\"},{\"currTime\":2405,\"text\":\"try to copulate. Oh yeah. It's like a drunk uncle almost. I feel like.\"},{\"currTime\":2412,\"text\":\"So, so caribou, you can kind of get near. Yeah. Musk ox, you can get near. They're pretty,\"},{\"currTime\":2417,\"text\":\"they don't know what's going on. They're just eating vegetation and staying put pretty much.\"},{\"currTime\":2422,\"text\":\"They don't move a lot. Um, do you get a sense of, uh, of an eye? Like, do you get a sense of\"},{\"currTime\":2430,\"text\":\"like what the ice age was like and stuff when you're up there? Like, do you start to get\"},{\"currTime\":2433,\"text\":\"like a sense of like, wow, what people have gone through over history and stuff like that? Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":2437,\"text\":\"Yeah. You'll find, uh, not only fossils from 300 million years ago of coral and stuff when it\"},{\"currTime\":2444,\"text\":\"used to be under the ocean up there. Yeah. Um, but then you'll also very rarely find artifacts\"},{\"currTime\":2451,\"text\":\"from native folks from 10,000 years ago or whatever. I found, uh, a little spearhead\"},{\"currTime\":2456,\"text\":\"sitting on top of this little knoll. I went up there because it was looked like a good viewpoint\"},{\"currTime\":2461,\"text\":\"and I'm sitting there looking for animals and stuff.

Also 10,000 years ago,\"},{\"currTime\":2470,\"text\":\"no one else went up there since. Wow. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. So yeah, it's amazing knowing that\"},{\"currTime\":2477,\"text\":\"it's so human. Something like that is very human. Like, uh, yeah, like, uh, I would feel so like,\"},{\"currTime\":2483,\"text\":\"wow, like I'm a part of something very long. Yeah. And then you go back to the station and eat\"},{\"currTime\":2488,\"text\":\"ravioli or something. You lose a connection. You cut that microwave on and it really kind of\"},{\"currTime\":2496,\"text\":\"shuts down those inner beacons. Yeah. Yeah. I guess it's like, it's hard to not be stuck sometimes\"},{\"currTime\":2503,\"text\":\"though in this society that we're in though. That's the thing that you blame humans. Do you blame\"},{\"currTime\":2508,\"text\":\"businesses? Do you blame, is there any blame? Is it just the like where we are kind of like,\"},{\"currTime\":2514,\"text\":\"and this isn't everyone. Obviously this is more cities than rural areas. Yeah. I think\"},{\"currTime\":2519,\"text\":\"it's the natural tendency for most animals to try to make their situation easier, not necessarily\"},{\"currTime\":2525,\"text\":\"better or maybe in a certain definition, but easier. Like if a dog gets unlimited food,\"},{\"currTime\":2532,\"text\":\"they'll might just eat themselves into obesity, right? Yeah. And it's not good for them, but they\"},{\"currTime\":2538,\"text\":\"might, if they could articulate their thoughts, it might be like, well, it's all this food would\"},{\"currTime\":2542,\"text\":\"be good if I ate it, you know, maybe there won't be later. So I think every little incremental\"},{\"currTime\":2550,\"text\":\"change along the way has seemed like a benefit to us and it has been in a sense, but, but there are\"},{\"currTime\":2556,\"text\":\"always unforeseen effects that come off of it that you can't predict.

Not this, maybe their next generation or two might,\"},{\"currTime\":2638,\"text\":\"but whoever this person is, you know, I've seen some people wandering around a gas station sometime\"},{\"currTime\":2643,\"text\":\"like, God, this dude, you know, he'll stay in here forever, dude.

It's like, Oh,\"},{\"currTime\":2668,\"text\":\"they're, or it's the culture where if everybody's doing this one thing, it's so hard to go against\"},{\"currTime\":2672,\"text\":\"the grain. And that's, that's the biggest part of the trouble is that the way I talk about things,\"},{\"currTime\":2681,\"text\":\"a lot of people say like, what do you want to go back to the 1700s?

Is it people\"},{\"currTime\":2722,\"text\":\"that are able to realize that not to give in to all the comforts that are able to have some\"},{\"currTime\":2731,\"text\":\"awareness? Yeah. Or what is the next survival of the fittest? Because survival of the fittest\"},{\"currTime\":2734,\"text\":\"used to be, it was the strongest. Yeah. Right. And it was often sometimes the craftiest too.\"},{\"currTime\":2739,\"text\":\"Yeah, definitely. But you had to also, like you had to align yourself with somebody that\"},{\"currTime\":2743,\"text\":\"was strength because you would need that support. But now I'm wondering what it's becoming\"},{\"currTime\":2747,\"text\":\"in our society, in America anyway. Yeah. I feel like we're adapted to get the next generation\"},{\"currTime\":2754,\"text\":\"going, but not really anything beyond that, which logically we shouldn't be programmed to think that\"},{\"currTime\":2760,\"text\":\"far into the future because every other animal just tries to get the next generation out and then\"},{\"currTime\":2766,\"text\":\"they've done their part, you know.

When you're up in Alaska away\"},{\"currTime\":2799,\"text\":\"from people that long, and then you come back, do you find it hard to communicate with people?\"},{\"currTime\":2804,\"text\":\"A little bit. Yeah, I think because I work alone most of the time up there and I have my thoughts,\"},{\"currTime\":2810,\"text\":\"you know, on tumble dry up top. Yeah, it can be weird trying to articulate these kind of ideas,\"},{\"currTime\":2818,\"text\":\"I guess. And do people seem stupid? That's a good question. Yeah, do people seem stupid when\"},{\"currTime\":2825,\"text\":\"you come back to us? Like when you come back to like, you know? No, like it's not stupid at all\"},{\"currTime\":2831,\"text\":\"because you guys are well adapted to your situation here, you know, like maybe not long term as a\"},{\"currTime\":2838,\"text\":\"species, but everybody's just kind of doing what they got to do, you know.

You know, it just never ends here. What is amazing about LA is how quickly you can get\"},{\"currTime\":2878,\"text\":\"way away from here. Like the hike I went on yesterday with my buddy up in the San Gabriel\"},{\"currTime\":2884,\"text\":\"Mountains, I guess. Is it Eagle Rock or something? It was Dawson Saddle up to Thoup Peak, I think.\"},{\"currTime\":2892,\"text\":\"Damn. Which is up at like 9,000 something hundred feet. It's gorgeous up there. We've maybe passed\"},{\"currTime\":2897,\"text\":\"10 people on the trail in four or five hours. And to you, that was busy. It was, yeah. It's\"},{\"currTime\":2903,\"text\":\"like this place. This is bumper to bumper.

I've been to Eagle Rock or something out there before. It was about an\"},{\"currTime\":2920,\"text\":\"hour and 40 minute drive to get out there. But it was gorgeous. Was there a chairlift that if you\"},{\"currTime\":2926,\"text\":\"wanted to, like it was around there in that area? We passed some chair lifts. Yeah. I think I've\"},{\"currTime\":2930,\"text\":\"been up that hike before. It's absolutely amazing. Yeah. And you can see LA and downtown and the\"},{\"currTime\":2935,\"text\":\"distance in the smog. And it's just like, all of that is happening down there. And nobody's up here.\"},{\"currTime\":2941,\"text\":\"It's crazy, huh? Yeah. Some cool birds, some dirty bird species up there, pygmy,\"},{\"currTime\":2945,\"text\":\"nut hatch. Really? Bush tit.

National Geographic.\"},{\"currTime\":2965,\"text\":\"Oh, dude, I remember jerking off back in the day to National Geographic, you know?\"},{\"currTime\":2969,\"text\":\"There's a dark tit near a fire. No wonder I ended up like I did. That's a beautiful bird,\"},{\"currTime\":2974,\"text\":\"isn't it? Yeah. Well, that's beautiful. Yeah. Do you think like, do you get a sense when you're\"},{\"currTime\":2982,\"text\":\"up there by other animals that they know that you're a human? Do they think that you're like an\"},{\"currTime\":2987,\"text\":\"anomaly or like an abnormality? Do you think like? It is kind of weird because,\"},{\"currTime\":2993,\"text\":\"yeah, they're not evolved to know what we are. I guess, you know, native people have been there\"},{\"currTime\":2996,\"text\":\"for 10,000 years. So maybe that's enough for some of them. Most of them run away. Like,\"},{\"currTime\":3001,\"text\":\"they seem to understand that whatever you are, it's probably not good. Yeah. But I've had bird,\"},{\"currTime\":3006,\"text\":\"but I've had birds laying on my head, you know, like... Oh, that's cool. Yeah. So there's some\"},{\"currTime\":3010,\"text\":\"animals that seem to see you as like something to land on, I guess. Do you find that animals are\"},{\"currTime\":3016,\"text\":\"still like curious about it? Like, do you find that they're curious a little bit? Like, what are\"},{\"currTime\":3019,\"text\":\"animals like kind of? They're mostly just minding their own business and trying not to get eaten\"},{\"currTime\":3026,\"text\":\"by something. You know, like, you ever watch a bird eating, they're just looking up every two\"},{\"currTime\":3031,\"text\":\"seconds. Like, they'll take a bite and then look up and they just can't relax. Yeah. So I feel bad\"},{\"currTime\":3037,\"text\":\"for them. And then the migration, you know, like, they migrate using the celestial sky. So they\"},{\"currTime\":3045,\"text\":\"orient themselves to the stars and migrate that way. Really? Yeah. So they operate totally,\"},{\"currTime\":3050,\"text\":\"their migration patterns, they base those all after looking at the stars and seeing what's\"},{\"currTime\":3054,\"text\":\"going on? They know where the North Star is and they orient based on that. So they have these\"},{\"currTime\":3061,\"text\":\"kind of like tracks in their genetics, basically. Some of them have it in there and some of them\"},{\"currTime\":3066,\"text\":\"learn it. But that's, it's sad because like all these cities and all this light pollution\"},{\"currTime\":3072,\"text\":\"and totally disorient them. Yeah, you got a couple of sparrows jerking off outside of Detroit\"},{\"currTime\":3078,\"text\":\"for no reason. Yeah, they got to move it along. But like, but no, I could totally imagine that.\"},{\"currTime\":3083,\"text\":\"Yeah, like how we're damaging like, how we're like, we don't even realize the effects that we're\"},{\"currTime\":3088,\"text\":\"having. Not at all. Yeah, because most people never would have a reason to stop and think about it.\"},{\"currTime\":3093,\"text\":\"Like the Twin Tower Memorial in New York, they have these two pillars of light that they put\"},{\"currTime\":3100,\"text\":\"up around that time, I think in late September. And that's right during bird migration. And there's\"},{\"currTime\":3106,\"text\":\"videos of literally hundreds and thousands of birds flying around and around and around,\"},{\"currTime\":3111,\"text\":\"and falling to their death. And if they see a certain number of birds up there in the lights,\"},{\"currTime\":3116,\"text\":\"they'll shut them off for a half an hour. But just that alone is killing probably thousands\"},{\"currTime\":3121,\"text\":\"of birds a year. So that's just, that's the kind of, that's a perfect example. Yeah, perfect example.\"},{\"currTime\":3127,\"text\":\"Like we're doing something that we feel like humans doing something that we feel like is\"},{\"currTime\":3130,\"text\":\"honoring, you know, others that it's, you know, it's, it's out of love and, you know, support.\"},{\"currTime\":3136,\"text\":\"And then even in that space, we're killing thousands of fucking birds every year.\"},{\"currTime\":3141,\"text\":\"A pile on the ground. We're just trying to get to Florida. Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":3144,\"text\":\"Some guys shoveling them into the ditch in a while. Sure. But that's the thing. Yeah, there's\"},{\"currTime\":3150,\"text\":\"always such an example. Yeah. Always unforeseen costs. And I think anytime you can ask yourself\"},{\"currTime\":3157,\"text\":\"what is the cost of what I'm doing or what I'm participating in, you find you, you go further\"},{\"currTime\":3163,\"text\":\"down the line and you realize things that you never would have figured out from the get go.\"},{\"currTime\":3167,\"text\":\"And then nobody really talks about, you know, it's interesting. We try and think about that\"},{\"currTime\":3171,\"text\":\"even sometimes just here with podcasts and like trying not to sell like bad products to people\"},{\"currTime\":3175,\"text\":\"or like, you know, we're trying like, you know, I'm trying to think of what else. Yeah. I mean,\"},{\"currTime\":3180,\"text\":\"I think we try to affect the things that are close to us. But yeah, it's interesting. It's\"},{\"currTime\":3186,\"text\":\"like as you, it's so weird. It's like you grow up or I grew up anyway, I guess like I'm, you end up\"},{\"currTime\":3193,\"text\":\"in working in a business or in society and it's kind of built where it's like you want to,\"},{\"currTime\":3201,\"text\":\"you know, achieve things or achieve your goals. And with those, it's almost like you don't even\"},{\"currTime\":3207,\"text\":\"realize the side effects that are going on or the even the chain that you're put that we're\"},{\"currTime\":3211,\"text\":\"apart of the whole system we're apart of isn't even, it's not working like very like copacetic\"},{\"currTime\":3217,\"text\":\"with nature all the time because we don't have to see the effects of anything we do now. Like\"},{\"currTime\":3221,\"text\":\"everything happens somewhere else. Some somebody else is doing everything to produce the things\"},{\"currTime\":3226,\"text\":\"that we use and depend on. So back when we were in hunter gather groups, we saw the effects of\"},{\"currTime\":3232,\"text\":\"everything you did right right in front of you. Yeah, you couldn't eat everything there was because\"},{\"currTime\":3236,\"text\":\"then there was nothing left right here. We just kind of pretend that there's an endless supply\"},{\"currTime\":3242,\"text\":\"of everything and we create so much destruction with people like Jesus Christ and nature. Sorry,\"},{\"currTime\":3253,\"text\":\"but no, you're it. Yeah, it's sad. I mean, it's almost does it get sad a little bit? It's totally\"},{\"currTime\":3258,\"text\":\"sad. And that's that's one of the hardest things is like feeling so at odds with the rest of how\"},{\"currTime\":3264,\"text\":\"most of society works and kind of feeling like it really shouldn't be like this. But you got to\"},{\"currTime\":3269,\"text\":\"play the game a little bit. But right, you have to play the game some you have to meet people\"},{\"currTime\":3275,\"text\":\"where they are you have to like, do you look at society as like, is it hard not to look at\"},{\"currTime\":3281,\"text\":\"societies like oh, they're bad people, these people that we are bad? It's hard to not think that and\"},{\"currTime\":3286,\"text\":\"that would just be an emotional frustrated reaction. You know, but I know everybody is in the situation\"},{\"currTime\":3292,\"text\":\"they're in. And if I was in a different situation, I would be I would have, you know, less freedom to\"},{\"currTime\":3298,\"text\":\"make choices to yeah, and less time to think about it. So but that's why like, where we live down\"},{\"currTime\":3305,\"text\":\"south, that small village where everybody knows everybody, and you kind of help your neighbors\"},{\"currTime\":3311,\"text\":\"out, you trade bananas and oranges and stuff. Yeah, teamwork. Yeah, we grow coffee. And we\"},{\"currTime\":3319,\"text\":\"drink our own coffee. You know, it's nice to just when you can do something for yourself, do it\"},{\"currTime\":3324,\"text\":\"because it hits this kind of instinctual feeling we have where that was a part of our genetics,\"},{\"currTime\":3332,\"text\":\"you know, to be Yeah, yeah. Do you feel like we're far from that if we really tapped into it?\"},{\"currTime\":3337,\"text\":\"I don't know if we are.

And we keep pushing those things off. But we can't do it forever. Yeah, that's what I'm\"},{\"currTime\":3363,\"text\":\"talking about. Yeah, I'm ready for it, man. I'm ready for it. Yeah. Like if I die in like a big,\"},{\"currTime\":3368,\"text\":\"you know, thing that's crazy, it's like a, you know, a war for food or something, at least it's\"},{\"currTime\":3374,\"text\":\"going to be exciting.

Yeah, that was very realistic. Yeah. And it's like, how great, like even it's almost\"},{\"currTime\":3399,\"text\":\"like just to feel that alive for a minute. Yeah, yeah. You know, I was talking the other day to\"},{\"currTime\":3404,\"text\":\"this UFC fighter and he was telling me like, I've seen a picture of me lost a fighter, he'd come\"},{\"currTime\":3410,\"text\":\"in second.

And\"},{\"currTime\":3899,\"text\":\"yeah, it's incredible. It comes alive in June. All the little plants start growing a little bit\"},{\"currTime\":3904,\"text\":\"and flowering. The birds are all breeding. Bears are fattening up. And then by late August,\"},{\"currTime\":3909,\"text\":\"it starts snowing again and everything dies.

It's very condensed into a short period of time.\"},{\"currTime\":3921,\"text\":\"Wow. And, uh, yeah. So I, once the migratory birds take off,\"},{\"currTime\":3925,\"text\":\"then I basically follow them down to Costa Rica and get there and see them passing through.\"},{\"currTime\":3932,\"text\":\"So it's kind of a migratory lifestyle.\"},{\"currTime\":3934,\"text\":\"You ever seen one of the same birds?\"},{\"currTime\":3937,\"text\":\"Yeah.

You put a little\"},{\"currTime\":3955,\"text\":\"color. Oh yeah. I've seen it on the internet. They put a little sock or something.\"},{\"currTime\":3957,\"text\":\"Yeah. And so, yeah, we had, we studied golden wing warblers and they winter in Central America\"},{\"currTime\":3965,\"text\":\"and breed up in Northern US and Canada.

Do you think it's\"},{\"currTime\":3985,\"text\":\"some of that same type of thing? Like you want to go home sometimes or that?

Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":4111,\"text\":\"Because you kind of what? You upset the flow a little bit?\"},{\"currTime\":4114,\"text\":\"Yeah, just maybe just because like we're talking about you're supposed to know everybody in your\"},{\"currTime\":4121,\"text\":\"immediate sphere.

It's hard when there's some parts of rural living that aren't good, you know, like, there's\"},{\"currTime\":4516,\"text\":\"the massive opioid addiction issues.

        "transcript_text": " Today's guest is an arctic biologist who has come down directly from the Great White North to let us know exactly what's going on and to answer some questions we have about, well, all sorts of stuff. We're gonna get into nature, we're gonna get into the depths of the cold and Alaska. Today's guest is Mr. Seth Boudreau. So do you just come from Alaska? Right now, coming from Costa Rica, back up to Alaska, I just went down to see my lady and spent some time at my place, kind of in the middle of the work season. Okay. So basically five months a year in Alaska, May through September, studying migratory birds and wildlife and then the rest of the year I'm down in Costa Rica. And yeah, because you sent me a picture from, you sent me a picture one time of lunch, I guess it was, and it was some guana claws. You guys had a batch of guana. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I was like, dang, bro. Yeah, my lady's dad traps them in the yard and cooks them up and it's not that great. Yeah. Yeah, if you're in a tight spot, some of the guana will get you through. Well, yeah, I saw it looked, when I looked at them, and we'll have Nick put the picture up too, but they looked, I'd have thought you'd eaten a different part of the guana. I'd never really considered really the claw. Yeah, it was kind of all chopped up in there, but they're mostly bones, so it probably looked like a potful of claws. Yeah, that's what it looked like. Yeah. When you cook them up, how do you even cook those? Yeah, I think you cooked them in a pressure cooker with like a chopped tomato and some garlic and onion maybe, some chicken bouillon. Pretty simple. It's just kind of, you can cook it the same way you cook chicken. Yeah. But it's like, it's not that great. Is it like an island treat kind of? Is it pretty common there in Costa Rica? No, I think a lot of rural people eat it occasionally, but a lot of people think it's gross and definitely don't eat it too. Oh, yeah, it's kind of interesting. It's almost like when I was growing up, people would eat a lot of hogs head cheese and stuff, and where my sister lived, they cook cracklins a lot of times, where they'll just take a bunch of fat and put it in a pot. That's the best. Yeah. At the beginning, you're like, where's the meat, you know? And then by the end, you're just like, left with these pieces of fried leather. Oh, and they look, yeah, and they're just sort of tasty, really, and airy. They're almost just, it's almost like, they're almost like cotton candy, like the inverse of cotton candy. Oh, yeah, yeah. Cracklins. Pretty far on the other end of the spectrum. So, so, so when you go up to, when you go to Alaska, what part of Alaska are you in? In the Arctic, so north of the Brooks Range, I'm at a science station. Can you pull that up, Nick, the Brooks Range? We could see that. I just want to have an idea where you are. Yeah, about 370 miles north of Fairbanks. Yeah, and I don't even know where Fairbanks is, dude. How far from Phoenix? But I'm gonna know. Give me an idea. The state looks like this, you know? These are the Aleutian Islands. Fairbanks kind of right in the middle, and I'm up towards the top there. Okay. Yeah, so I'm above north of that mountain range. Oh, wow. So that's called the North Slope up there. That's where there's a lot of oil business going on, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. So it's, I mean, you're, you are up there. Yeah, it's about a 10-hour drive to get up to where I work. And if you go off the top, say you get to the top of Alaska and you take a boat north, what do you hit? The North Pole? Eventually some ice. Really? Yeah. You can, you can't really access the coast there without paying for a permit from the oil company to go on a tour. You can go on like an hour-long tour where you get to dip your toes in the Arctic Ocean, but they don't want people messing around up there. So you can't just access it on your own. They kind of own the whole North Coast line there. So they, so it's private property? Yeah, yeah. There's a town called Dead Horse up there. It's not really much of a town. It's like an industrial outpost where everything's made of metal and there's just testosterone in the air. It's a rough place. It's ugly. But you can see some cool birds up there, spectacle-liters and phalloropes and king-iters and stuff. That's pretty cool. Now are those birds that are indeed, they're only there? Spectacle-liters, yeah, are real Arctic specialists. They didn't even really know where they spent the winter until pretty recently. The whole population goes to like an opening in the ice out in the Bering Sea, I think. How do you say it? Spectacle-liters, E-I-D-E-R. And when you were up there, like how close are you getting to these birds? Like what do you do? Too close. My job, I'm a naturalist for the science station up there and so every day I'm out there just trying to document what's happening with wildlife, when the bird species arrive to the area, when they leave in the fall, and then other wildlife, you know, there's bears and wolves and wolverines and stuff up there. So I'm just out there spending time trying to see what's going on and document it, just for posterity, basically. Oh, wow, that's a beautiful bird, yeah. Yeah, so it's a sea duck and they just breed on the coast in grassy ponds and then spend the winter out among the sea ice and openings. Can you get a picture of the head again, Nick? Look at that thing. Wow. Yeah, what? And so what is that coming off the back and almost looks like gills up there by its head, is that? What is that? It's just feathering? Yeah, just weird feathers. And can you have one of these at the house or these more? These, you got to get some special permits for that. Yeah, they don't they don't take kindly. I think it's a threatened species probably. Wow. There's just not that many of them and they breed in really specific areas. And can you watch them fight or they don't fight? What do they do? They seem pretty docile to me. They're just kind of sitting around on the water, minding their own business. Yeah. It's, you know, Arctic summer is really short and so the birds kind of have to get there and get on with it, get the breeding done and then get the hell out of there. So and that's when a lot of them do breeding is in the summertime? Yeah, pretty much only then. So we have like 110 species of birds we've observed in the area that are coming from the lower 48 states, Central America, South America, even all the way down to Antarctica, someone spend the winter down there. So birds kind of just come like everybody's kind of popping in. Yeah. Yeah. Who's kind of the randiest group, you know, because sometimes you're like on a plane to Vegas and you got different groups. You got a couple of German guys, you know. You got one guy making his own cocaine in the backseat. You know, you got a bunch of Italians just, just, just, you know, drinking Deca 200. You got guys really, what kind of group gets up there and just really just turns it out? There's a bird called the Blue Throat that is mostly a Eurasian bird and the population just barely extends over into Alaska. So you have, if you want to see him in the United States, you have to go up there. And they, yeah, look at that. They sing bird karaoke. They do like imitations of other bird species and they'll do this repertoire that goes on for, they can imitate up to like 25 species of other birds. But you hear, so you hear it, you hear them singing all this stuff, but it sounds a little off, like karaoke, where you're like, I don't think that's really the white crown sparrow and it's that guy. Oh, and so they're just kind of, they're like impersonators almost. Yeah, yeah, totally. And yeah, the females seem to get a kick out of the male with the biggest repertoire. And oh, wow. Pretty cool, huh? Yeah, it's cool. So bird, bird watchers. That that bird's like going to be like, I'm gonna go up there and, now can they, will they tempt other females from other species to come on over with, since they're using different people's songs? I haven't seen them tempt females, but other species will definitely get agitated if they hear another bird singing their song, because they, when birds sing, they're basically advertising their territory. So they sing on the edges of their territory and then the bird with the next territory over will hear it and he'll kind of establish his border. So they suddenly hear their own song in a place where they thought they had their territory staked out. Some of them definitely respond aggressively. So it's, so when a bird like sings, it's, it's always to let people know that this is my territory? That and I'm available. So they're singing to let the females know that they've got this pad and they're ready to roll. Oh, okay. Yeah. So I got a comfortable place here. I got a little spot at the days in or whatever. Got me a little spot at the Hampton Inn. Got it for the summer. Oh, wow. Gotta get out. Yeah. So those are the only two reasons. If you hear a bird, they're letting somebody know about their territory or they are letting females know that they're available. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. And is it just male birds that sing or female birds also sing? Mostly just male birds sing and females do little calls that they use to keep in touch with each other and to warn each other of predators and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Waiting for this one bitch to text me back right now. It's only been two weeks. So she's probably busy, you know, traveling or something. Yeah. How cold so when you get up to Alaska, man, how cold is it? Like because people think of Alaska and you know, like a lot of people you think of like gold country and that sort of thing. You think of it being cold. Is there a level where it doesn't matter that's cold anymore that you can't even like we can't even really feel a difference between say, you know, 20 degrees below and like 80 degrees below? 20 degrees below is not bad at all. When you get down to 40, I think 50 below is the lowest I've experienced. And then you're just in pain. You just don't want to be outside at all. And yeah. So down to minus 20, it's very dry up there, at least in Fairbanks. And so you can still go skiing and stuff and have an all right time. But when it gets colder than that, like you can feel a breeze coming underneath the bottom of your cabin door, just because the temperature difference is so great that the air is just like blowing in trying to equal it out. So explain that to me. Like, I don't know what you're talking about exactly. When there's differences in temperature, the air wind is basically air moving from one place to another, right? Okay, ridiculously simple way to describe when. Yeah, I get it. I think we all understand that. But like, when there's a big difference inside and outside, the air is trying to equalize to normal it out. Okay. So you have these like 10 inch thick walls of a cabin or even the doors are usually have several inches of insulation. But just at the bottom, the only space where there's a little bit of air, it's just blowing in like your pants will go like this in the wind if you're standing near the door. Because the air is coming in. It's so much colder outside than it is inside. If you have it, you know, 60 inside that it just creates wind just trying to rush that close to each other. Yeah, yeah. But when I get up there in early May, and that's when it's still winter a little bit, there's usually a few feet of snow on the ground. But it's already full daylight. So I don't see the sunset until September. So the sun's up the whole time when you get there from May. Yep. Yeah. Which, yeah, as I get older, it gets harder to be used to that. Like we have blackout curtains, you know, to try to make it dark and in my room and stuff. But it's you can't keep it out the light a little bit. So, so yeah, it's kind of still winter a little bit in early May. And that's when the birds start to arrive to the area. So I'm out there all day like just visiting the same types of habitat and trying to keep track of when each species arrives to the area. I look like a concierge almost. Yeah, just trying to help them get settled in. So you do that for years and years and years and then you have a nice record of exactly what was happening, you know, in any given year. And you can track changes over time. And that's kind of how the good kinds of science work where you're just, there's people studying really specific stuff up there about carbon release into the atmosphere and all that. But I'm just studying very basic like what are the animals doing. I really love that because I've just always been more of a generalist where I like being outside and just paying attention to stuff rather than have my nose in the tundra sniffing gases or whatever they're doing. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's not, you're not as much of a corporate hunter. Freelance. Yeah. When they, when you start to see like different patterns from birds, is there a time when you like really start to get scared? Like is there one species that you really start to pay attention to? Yeah, there's a couple times the birds have frightened me a little bit. There's a bird called a long-tailed yaeger that it's a seabird. Basically, it's kind of like a gullish tarnish type of bird, but they're a predatory seabird and they only come inland to breed on tundra. Yeah, that one. So they eat voles and lemmings and stuff and when there aren't a lot of lemmings or voles around, those populations kind of crash occasionally and when there's not any round, they'll just form groups of like 40 and just maraud around and one time I saw a group of 40 just coming over a hill and there was kind of a thundercloud in the distance and I was like, I didn't know that they did that yet. It's like, why are these 40 birds coming at me? They're pretty gnarly. Yeah. I thought maybe they teamed up when we're coming to get you. I thought there was a tsunami coming or something. Oh, wow. Yeah, you just, you spend enough time out there, you see weird things like that that most people, you know, don't know happen. Yeah, how, I mean animals are so in tune with Mother Nature, they're almost like, it's almost like they're like working for Mother Nature or something. Yeah, I guess. Or like you could get clues from them, you know. Yeah, yeah, definitely. I learned a lot about us from watching them and I think that's one of the great things about doing that kind of work is just being out there and having the opportunity to be away from all the other noise that's going on and just watch other things and have time to think and yeah, I've been doing it for 17 years now. So like ever since I've been an adult. And is it a lifestyle that you think you could get that you would want to go away from or do you start to like look forward? I mean, do you really just look forward to that time up there? Oh, yeah. I mean, I'm away from my girlfriend, fiance, for those five months, which is why I go down and visit in the middle of that for 10 days. So it's really great to see her. And that's a cost, you know, like it's definitely an alternative lifestyle and a lot of couples, I don't think, could pull it off long distance relationship. But we've been going nearly six years now and it's great. I would love it, man. Oh, I can't see you for four months. I just love you, though. For me, it'd be great. I mean, yeah, it would just be, I think it's almost something I'm gonna have to have in my life. I'm trying to think of like, or something that I think about like, how quiet does it get? It must get extremely quiet, huh? It gets so quiet that you can hear your own heartbeat, like in your ears. Yeah, where there's no other sound, especially when there's no wind or anything. And you don't, yeah, being here, I'm in the belly of the beast here. Yeah, especially LA. Yeah. Oh my God, flying in. Everybody else seems to think it's fine, but I'm looking out there like, this is so wrong. Now, when you say that, is it just like the amount of people, the amount of like, goings on in one space, like the lack of space? What? Yeah, that just humans living so out of balance with nature and just everything that's here, we depend on someone else somewhere else making and doing, you know, like, it's kind of weird. Yeah. And I don't think it's good for us really, like, having watched animals for so long, you kind of realize like, we are just another animal. We are an ape. We're not special. We're not even domesticated. Like, we're as wild as we ever were. We just have changed our habitat a lot, you know, to suit us. But it comes at such a great cost that when you're outside of this stuff and have the peace and time to kind of get out of it and then you come back to it, it's pretty shocking. Wow. Yeah. But it's like, you know, if you're in a bad relationship and your buddy could come up and tell you why you should get out of it, you can listen and it makes logical sense maybe, but you come up with excuses for why you're just not going to do it yet. And then years later when you do, you look back and you're like, what the hell was I thinking? Yeah. That's what's going on? Yeah, just because I had that chance to be outside of this human civilization kind of. And so you get a different perspective, I think. But I can't expect to make people understand that in the same way that when you're in a bad relationship, like someone could explain something perfectly. Yeah. Yeah. It's hard to see something when you're in it. Yeah. So it's nice to like down in Costa Rica, you know, I'm living in a tiny little village. It's 200 people and there's no other gringos around except for a couple of families of Mennonites. But like, yeah. They're wild, huh? They're bacon over there. They get a little bakery and they're pretty interesting. They called, I got a Facebook message from someone I didn't know the other day saying the Mennonites want you to call them. Gang, bro. And I'm like, what do the Mennonites need me for? And it was a bird identification question. They saw a bird that wasn't in the book. And I'm like, yeah, it's a southern lifeline. Thanksgiving over there with those Mennos, man. That's beautiful. And they're pretty self-sufficient those cultures, aren't they? Like Mennonites and Amish? In a way, yeah. The Mennonites are kind of weird where they use cell phones. They don't use the internet, but they'll use cell phones. They use motors and not like the Amish in that sense. They're really nice, but you feel a little weird around them because the women are covered, you know, from head to toe. And I kissed an older Mennonite lady on the cheek by accident because that's a custom in Costa Rica when you say goodbye to someone. Yeah, yeah. And as I got closer, I kind of realized like she doesn't want this to happen, but I'm into it. Oh, yeah, yeah. That's a lot of Gianni and Nick's sexual history. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of that going on in here. But yeah, so being in these quiet places, it's great when people visit. Like I've got a lot of good buddies I grew up with who have come down to the place. Just to hang out in Alaska. Oh, to Costa Rica. Few have come up to Alaska, but I don't get that much time off up there. So yeah, my seven months a year off is down in Costa Rica and that's where people come visit and can kind of like, I think they, before they visit, they imagine me laying in a hammock on the beach drinking imperial or something. Yeah, yeah. When they come down and see where we're living in like a really small rural agricultural village, we're growing coffee. So you got to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of action. Yeah, which is, that's kind of the best way we can be is just doing work that's meaningful to you, to people around you. Yeah, I can imagine the exchange, the human exchange you get by helping others or being part of a small community. Yeah, yeah. That's how we're evolved to be. We're supposed to be living in tribal groups of up to 100, 150. And then we've gotten so far away from that that I don't think we can see our way back. But do you think there could be a correction that happens that brings us back? Sometimes I feel like that's the thing that I'm wondering. Like, does mother nature finally be like, oh, right, enough of this Sims bullshit, you know, about to tighten up the ship? I think it's unavoidable. It happens that every other species on earth, every other species population goes up and down and up and down. Really? Yeah, I mean, like, links and snowshoe hairs, their populations kind of follow each other as the hair population gets high, the links start producing more kittens and then the start eating all the hairs and start dying off and then the links have to die off. Everything else goes like that. And if you look at a graph of the human population since like 1700, we've just gone and we've done it by, you know, like advances in agriculture and medicine and everything, which some of them are great, but we can't keep going forever. Like, how sustainable is it? It's not at all. So that's hard to watch happening, like, and that no one gives a shit right now. Like, I'm lucky, the time I've had to be out in the wild and get that perspective, but it makes it harder to be in the civilized world because no one else like knows what the hell I'm talking about. Oh, yeah, you start to look like an alien. Yeah, you start to seem like something that's it starts to seem like you're the odd man out. Right, exactly. Or when really it's the it's kind of the other way. I mean, I think especially in America, we don't notice that there's more like rural living in a lot of other cultures. Yeah, we don't realize that like in the whole globe that there's tons of it going on. Yeah, yeah, like when people are talking about how we're going to have smart cars driving everybody around here, the rest of the world has no idea that's even being discussed, right, except for in big cities, maybe, but like, yeah, it's not funny. I go to Illinois, like in the summer and they have a small town up there and they don't even get 4g like it's 3g is what you get on your phone. So it's like, if you want to watch a video, dude, you got to drive with your buddy, you know, 19 minutes, you know, park outside the McDonald's, that's enough fricking phone heat. So it's like those people aren't even worried about it's more like an agricultural environment in that in that area. Yeah. And everybody else, everybody else looks down on them. You know, yeah, like they produce the food we eat. They do all this stuff that we kind of tried to get away from having to do ourselves. Yeah. And then we look down on them. It's so wrong. It is crazy. I mean, especially like a lot of like media and stuff these days. Yeah. You know, I mean, even Alaska, I'm sure, I mean, CNN hates anything that's white, it seems like. So I'm surprised that they even, I'm surprised they're not Alaska deniers, but um, um, but yeah, it is. I guess it's like, I mean, you have such an interesting insight into that because you get to see what it's like you're almost living in two different realms. Totally. Yeah. Yeah. And just occasionally passing through this one and just being like, what the hell is going on? You know, like. Wow. Because your layovers are here on the way, on your way back to. Right. Costa Rica. Basically between these two kind of remote areas I passed through places like this. And so I'm away for long enough where things have changed since I last came through and I can see them and most of them are alarming. Wow. Like the Uber drive over here is scarier than any bear encounter I've ever had. I agree. That's a good call. I mean, like it's way more dangerous being on a highway here than being up there. And now, so you just, you must notice so many just like small, like, do you notice that you were alarmed at a personal level? Or do you notice that you were alarmed at a natch at a level of like, you know, tension in your body or things like that, that from being in the city, like for on the Uber drive, for example. Yeah, both for sure. Like I definitely feel way more in danger just because we're supposed to know everybody that we interact with. That's how our brains have been for hundreds of thousands of years. So to be in a place where I've got a couple buddies I grew up with that I visit when I'm here. Other than that, everybody's a stranger. And yeah, it is kind of wild to think of how many strangers you run across and run past. Yeah. So like people are great generally, but you just, I think evolutionarily been the back of your mind, you're not at ease or at least I'm not, you know? Yeah. And I think, you know, we're an ape, but we're obviously super adaptable. So most people have adapted to deal with that pretty fine. And yeah, not me. Do you feel like we're definitely apes? You have no doubt about it? No doubt. Yeah. Anybody who thinks we're not just hasn't thought about it enough, I think. But don't you think, man, you got to think if we're eight, like, I've never looked at an ape. Like, for example, I've never been to the zoo and been like, you know, miss the old place, you know, like nowhere in my body does that reflect. And I'm not saying, I think maybe we might be monkeys that God created, you know, like, I think maybe, I mean, do you think we're really an ape? Like, have you ever smelled your armpit like after a nice hike? Yeah, a little bit when I was younger. Yeah. I mean, I get the hang of it now kind of, but yeah, I mean, like you watch how we behave in groups and very much like apes. Exactly as apes. Like, it's a miracle anytime we act above an ape, I think. It's a miracle. Yeah. And it doesn't happen that often. Oh, the more that I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt, and then I'll go around to different places, then I'm like, damn, it's really hard to keep doing this. Yeah, yeah. You know, people like we will constantly let each other down. Yeah, yeah, it's terrible. But that's because there's so many of us so crowded in that we don't mean anything to each other. Right. Yeah, that's a great statement. Yeah. That's exactly what I feel like here all the time. Yeah. So when you're in a small community where you're kind of interdependent, that's how we're programmed to function. Like, in a group of apes, nonhuman apes or human apes, like, everybody's supposed to have a role. Yeah. And everybody kind of does something that contributes to the group every day. So in larger cities, you can have a lot of people that they don't, they may have a role, but they're, it's not as prominent or it's not as defined or maybe they can't find their role there. Yeah, it's, yeah, we're set up. You probably didn't create a lot of depression out of that. Exactly. Yeah. So it's not surprising to me at all how much depression there is and how people are so disconnected as totally logical. Right. You know, because we're in, oh, I like thinking about this is interesting. Yeah, because in cities, it's so funny. When I go home or I go someplace else, even when I go to other places in the US, even I just feel so much, the second I leave here, I feel so much more relaxed. Yeah. Yeah, man. It's just, I just feel better. Yeah. You know, I just feel like, yeah, I don't know. I just don't feel like I have to just, I feel like I have to fight so hard here to just be a person. Yeah, you do. And it's just taxing after a while. It's real frenetic here. There's no quiet, there's no darkness at night, there's all the light pollution. Like it's so against how we're, how we spent so much time being just in this recent fraction of modern times is the only time that we're like this. Yeah. Yeah. So fast. Yeah. What do you think are going to be some of the side effects of some of this that we're going to see? I mean, obviously, we're seeing a lot of them now with like depression, you know, people not feeling like they fit into the world, which makes sense. It's like, how could you feel like you fit in when there's so many people all clogged together and our genetics haven't really caught up to this new way of living? Yeah. Yeah, I don't know, man. That's the thing is I have no answer for it. Even after all this time, it still boggles my mind. And I see no way out of it other than just each person trying to do good things where they can on a scale that they can see the results of. Oh, yeah. So like these, we always think of these problems as big global issues, but they're local issues. Right. Just piled on top of each other, and they're all results of individual people's decisions. Yeah. So like, you can't. Yeah, I think that way all the time. Yeah. You can't solve a big global issue. You can just see work that needs to be done, do it, and hope that you live to see the results or that your kids do or something. But even that, we're being an ape, we're not programmed to think that far. Possibly being an ape. Yeah, it's still up for debate. I mean, it's just like, here's the thing, dude, I've never seen an ape and been like, oh yeah, you know. Really? My buddy. Really? Fuck no, I haven't. You gotta go to the zoo again, man. Bro, I've been over there, man. I've been over there, but I've never seen an ape yet. Not once have I looked at an ape and been like, oh man, yeah, wonder what the boys are up to. Fuck no, man. I'm not saying that it's not a possibility, but now, but you're out in nature, you're out in like, really, you're out in the expanse of probably some of the most beautiful places you could probably see. Is that true or is it just disgusting? Is it barren up there and like, is it miserable? It's both. Okay. Yeah, like the mosquitoes in Alaska in the summertime, I don't know if you know, but it's insane. Oh yeah. Like you have to wear- And that's not a racial slurry, he's talking about the actual animal. Yeah, you have to wear headnets and stuff. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But there's no humidity, right? It's pretty dry, but with all the snow melt, that melts in the spring and the mosquitoes have laid their eggs in those areas and they kind of start hatching out. There's videos that have been shot up where I work where you will not believe the amount of mosquitoes. So- Oh, you got to go to Jefferson Paris, dude, in Louisiana, but they have debt. I mean, we go toe-to-toe with each other in a contest, yeah. Before we bring our mosquitoes in, you bring yours there, and we watch them fight or something over there in Reno. Then they hybridize. Yeah, look at that. We have it, wow. Oh my God. This looks like a big orgy or something. It is, yeah, yeah. But so like- Hold on a second, because there's two things I'm thinking of. One, are mosquitoes like little bitty birds? I know they're insects, but are they similar to birds or not? They fly, and some people say it's the Alaska State bird, you know, some bumper stickers of that. Okay. So that's evidence, right? But as far as like genetically, and like, are they similar? Not really. No. Okay. Kind of buzzkill a little. Yeah, literally. No pun intended. Yeah. Wow, Nick, walking spicy there today. No pun intended on the buzzkill, man. That's good. Yeah. And some, I'll repeat it because some of us are still didn't get it. That's the only reason. And I don't think if I fully got it. Yeah. But that's a, it's a fair point. Like, there's great beauty up there. It's magnificently. But wouldn't that beauty make you think like, okay, there's a higher power, there's something creating, not, I mean, yeah, there's something, there's something bigger going on with something creating all this. Yeah, I don't know. I just, with that question, I always just end up saying, I don't know, and I don't know if it even matters. Like, here we are. Right. Right. It's a good point. Yeah. Like, basing your whole existence on that seems kind of intense. Yeah. I'm thinking that you know which one of the many thousands of answers is the right one. But do you, but when you, when you're in some of those spaces and it's so natural and it's so quiet and you have the ability to even hear your own heartbeat. Yeah. Like, it must be like almost like a really intense meditation that goes on at like a core level or at like a level of even your, your cells that you can't even really fath and probably a level of like peacefulness and stuff. Yeah. Do you, does that make you feel like, like what insight do you get to, is there like something bigger going on here? Or is there, do you feel like a part of something bigger or do you just feel like really small? Does it? You, you definitely feel more part of the big picture, but you also feel small, small because you are a tiny part of a giant picture. Right. So, because especially if you're studying nature and stuff like that, you're really, I mean, you're right there on the food chain. I mean, you're basically, you know, and yeah, I've been charged by your policy in the food chain, really. I've been charged by bears, muskox. I had an incident with a swan, you know. What do you mean? You say you had an incident with a swan? I mean, I've had, I've had, I mean, I've had a couple, I had some fucking shit go off in Oregon one time, but you know, I was trying to jog and these, dude, when some of those animals group up, they get real violent. They do. Yeah. It's like antifa almost or something. Yeah. You know? Yeah. Yeah. They definitely find strength in numbers. And you, you, you really, you went toe to toe with the swan up there? I went hand to neck with a swan. You killed it? Yeah. Yeah. Choked it out. Damn boy. That's what I'm saying, dude. Poirier over Cabee, bro. That's where I'm going with right there. It nearly got the best of me though. Did it really? They're like this tall. Yeah. And the wings are probably more than six feet across. Oh yeah. And yeah. Jesus. Yeah. So, and what do they do? How do they come in? Like, what's their attack? They're mostly body work. Is it really? Yeah. Bro, how is that not a fucking sport? There have been so many, dude, I remember they used to have this group and I, you know, I use this term, I don't know, loosely or however I use it, but they used to have a group that would come through our college in town called, it was fag fist fights, right? And it was gay men that would fist fight each other in a boxing ring and you'd pay for it at the bar. You'd pay six dollars or something and you got a beer and you got to watch these guys go at it. And, but I would pay anything to watch, you know, a biologist and a, and a, and a four and a half foot swan figuring things out. Go toe to toe, dude. Yeah. Yeah. So a lot of, do they strike at you? What do they do? They nip at you with the beak? Yeah. I got it by the neck right away. So it couldn't get me with the beak, but it was hissing at me. Nick wants to bet on this. And the fact that it went to the body first, that's always the best strategy. Yeah. Yeah. I was, I was taking it back. But yeah. So I had it by the neck and it was beating me with its wings and it's kind of disorienting. No, that's a good term, disorienting. So does it feel like painful or does it feel like scary? Kind of scary just because I thought, you know, I had shot it once and that was the last bullet we had. Where'd you shoot it? You just shoot a point blank or how'd you shoot it? No, it was in the, it, it was in the back. Jesus Christ, dude. Like the coward of Jesse James. Have you seen that movie? Man, sorry to call you out, dude, but damn. I know, but dude, we hadn't, we had no more food and we had another week to go out there. So what are you going to do? Look, man, I feel you. What is it? Oh, the assassination of Jeffy James. By the coward Robert Ford. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not proud. I'm not proud. He shot him in the back. It was trying to get away, but uh. So your food was that vital at that point? Yeah. I mean, we had this guy, this pilot was supposed to fly over a drop off to dry bags full of food and he was supposed to get a hundred feet off the water, but because of the weather, he was 500 feet up. So these dry bags hit the water, exploded Denzel Washington right there. I've seen that. So all we could salvage, we ran out into the river and trying to grab what we could, but it was going away pretty quickly. We got a small bottle of whiskey that the pilot had included for us just to be nice. Wow. And a couple of fruit cups. And so, and so that's your, that's your rations for the, for what, the next week? It would have been. Yeah. Yeah. A week and a half, I think. So now you're like, damn. Yeah, we're in trouble. So, uh, and we were, you know, probably a couple of hundred miles outside of Fairbanks, I think. So there's no getting out of there. And we're up a tiny little river where you have to float all the way down to get to a place where a plane, a float plane can come get you. And, um, so yeah, we just had to start hunting gross and geese and ducks and whatever there was, but we had a limited, we weren't planning on hunting. We have guns for bear protection. So we didn't have that many bullets, you know? Yeah. So you had to, uh, did you guys miss a couple of times or are you? No, no, we're pretty good. And is it a pistol? You walking right up on them and shooting them in the back or is it? No, it was a shotgun. Okay. Yeah. Jesus man. Yeah. And it kind of makes me sad a little. Yeah. Some grouse out there chilling, dude, you know, maybe having a cigarette or just relaxing. Yeah. Looking at the foliage. Yeah. Thinking of my own in land one day and you just come up and blow them in the back. They're gross, aren't that smart? Like, yeah, I've hunted them before and they'll, they'll get into a tree and they don't realize that they don't blend in with the tree. They blend it in when they were on the ground, but then they're in a tree and you can see there. Pretending like they're blending? They think they still blend in and they're like, I see you. That's a story in my life, I feel like. They think they're all slick looking at you. Yeah. Now, what about the fox, man? We had a fox in school when I was young and somebody stole it, right? And I knew, I knew it was going to happen. But, um, but what about the fox? Are they out there still? Yeah, there's red foxes up there, the occasional arctic fox. Wow. It's good to hear, man. They're cool to see. You watch them hunting voles through the snow in the spring and they're walking along on top of the snow and then they'll cock their head and kind of triangulate the sound. They're hearing the vole moving under the snow. Then they pop up under the air and dive into the snow and probably six times out of 10, they come up with the vole. It's like Iwo Jima, dude. Have you guys seen that, uh, D-Day or whatever? Um, that's insane, man. Is that one of the, is that one of the most unique hunting techniques that you see out there? Definitely. Yeah. Yeah. That's one of the few species I've actually got to see hunting. Even all this time up there, I've seen wolves chasing a caribou once. Wow. Look at that fox. And they're good jumpers, huh? Yeah. People don't realize that. They're like the Greg Luganus of like the, um, Animal Kingdom. Look at that. So they hear the, the rodent under the snow and then they get that lift and just hit them. Yeah. Damn. Yeah. They triangulate the location and then, I don't know how. They do that math in their head, huh? Shut it down. Wow. It's pretty wild. Now, what are some of the larger animals that you'll see up there in the area that you're in? Grizzly bears, um, the occasional moose, musk ox, caribou, those are the big ones. Um, which ones are the most friendly do you find to like, to humans? Or even maybe overall, do you, or can animals, some of them can seem friendly, like a dog can seem real friendly, you know? Yeah. Or any of those larger animals you see up there, um, friendly? Caribou, uh, aren't unfriendly. You can trick them to come closer to you by putting your arms up and it kind of looks like a pair of antlers and either their eyesight's not that good or they're not that bright, but they'll start walking towards you wondering if they're going to fight you or try to copulate. Oh yeah. It's like a drunk uncle almost. I feel like. So, so caribou, you can kind of get near. Yeah. Musk ox, you can get near. They're pretty, they don't know what's going on. They're just eating vegetation and staying put pretty much. They don't move a lot. Um, do you get a sense of, uh, of an eye? Like, do you get a sense of like what the ice age was like and stuff when you're up there? Like, do you start to get like a sense of like, wow, what people have gone through over history and stuff like that? Yeah. Yeah. You'll find, uh, not only fossils from 300 million years ago of coral and stuff when it used to be under the ocean up there. Yeah. Um, but then you'll also very rarely find artifacts from native folks from 10,000 years ago or whatever. I found, uh, a little spearhead sitting on top of this little knoll. I went up there because it was looked like a good viewpoint and I'm sitting there looking for animals and stuff. And then I see sitting next to me this spear point. So someone else thought it was a good viewpoint. Also 10,000 years ago, no one else went up there since. Wow. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. So yeah, it's amazing knowing that it's so human. Something like that is very human. Like, uh, yeah, like, uh, I would feel so like, wow, like I'm a part of something very long. Yeah. And then you go back to the station and eat ravioli or something. You lose a connection. You cut that microwave on and it really kind of shuts down those inner beacons. Yeah. Yeah. I guess it's like, it's hard to not be stuck sometimes though in this society that we're in though. That's the thing that you blame humans. Do you blame businesses? Do you blame, is there any blame? Is it just the like where we are kind of like, and this isn't everyone. Obviously this is more cities than rural areas. Yeah. I think it's the natural tendency for most animals to try to make their situation easier, not necessarily better or maybe in a certain definition, but easier. Like if a dog gets unlimited food, they'll might just eat themselves into obesity, right? Yeah. And it's not good for them, but they might, if they could articulate their thoughts, it might be like, well, it's all this food would be good if I ate it, you know, maybe there won't be later. So I think every little incremental change along the way has seemed like a benefit to us and it has been in a sense, but, but there are always unforeseen effects that come off of it that you can't predict. And by the time they're really prevalent, you're already too far used to the thing that you can't really think about going back. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. If you get used to like doing Halloween and they tell you, no, you're going to be, you're still going to be, you'll lay on the porch forever. You know, just expecting candy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's the hardest thing is like, I can totally see that. And it's really interesting because then even as humans, we have the addictive personality. Yeah. We have the ability, the easy ability to like that sugar lizard that just gets with, you know, just grasp the easiest first thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, you really have to fight that instinct these days in order to get to a more natural state of, of yourself. Yeah. And most people aren't interested in that at all. Like would never spend five minutes even thinking about it. Right. Isn't that baffling sometimes? It is. Yeah. Because I think a lot of times that we're all on this struggle where we're trying to, we're trying, we're trying our best, you know? We know that some of the stuff you're saying, we get it. We can feel it. You know, we know that I'm taking these easy way out here and there. And I know it's not benefiting me at like a level inside of me. But, but then you see some people and you're like, Oh, they don't, that, they don't stand a chance. Yeah. Not this, maybe their next generation or two might, but whoever this person is, you know, I've seen some people wandering around a gas station sometime like, God, this dude, you know, he'll stay in here forever, dude. He's going to eat one of those hot dogs. Yeah, bro. He's going to eat 100 of them. You know, this dude will be in here forever. Yeah. You know, this dude will lay on the grill after a while. I think it is a tan booth. Oh, he's going to change his name to Frank. Yeah. It just never in, bro. This dude will feed himself to his own family. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like it's just, you meet people that are like, and it's not their fault really. It's just maybe where they are genetically. Yeah. It's like, Oh, they're, or it's the culture where if everybody's doing this one thing, it's so hard to go against the grain. And that's, that's the biggest part of the trouble is that the way I talk about things, a lot of people say like, what do you want to go back to the 1700s? No, like there were good things we gave up along the way that we shouldn't have given up. Like the great things we've come up with in medicine. Yeah. Like witchcraft, I think. Yeah. Probably better. I don't know why I keep looking at these guys. They're not laughing at any of my jokes either. I'm joking. You're doing a good job. Gianni's not. Yeah, that's true. We've created a real totalitarian environment that we're not very proud of sometimes. But so, isn't it crazy to think then that like we're, it's like survival of what will be the fittest then moving forward? Is it people that are able to realize that not to give in to all the comforts that are able to have some awareness? Yeah. Or what is the next survival of the fittest? Because survival of the fittest used to be, it was the strongest. Yeah. Right. And it was often sometimes the craftiest too. Yeah, definitely. But you had to also, like you had to align yourself with somebody that was strength because you would need that support. But now I'm wondering what it's becoming in our society, in America anyway. Yeah. I feel like we're adapted to get the next generation going, but not really anything beyond that, which logically we shouldn't be programmed to think that far into the future because every other animal just tries to get the next generation out and then they've done their part, you know. Forget what the hell was, where I was going with that. Had us to be in the middle of every sentence, dude. Imagine running into a room to tell people something and forget what it was. Just looking exciting. Well, that's how I feel every single sentence. It's like, it's gonna be good. And then you just stand in there with a murder weapon in your hand. You're like, fuck, man, I need a preposition. You know, it's a little alarming. What do you guys get over here? Nick, Gianni, what's going on? When you're up in Alaska away from people that long, and then you come back, do you find it hard to communicate with people? A little bit. Yeah, I think because I work alone most of the time up there and I have my thoughts, you know, on tumble dry up top. Yeah, it can be weird trying to articulate these kind of ideas, I guess. And do people seem stupid? That's a good question. Yeah, do people seem stupid when you come back to us? Like when you come back to like, you know? No, like it's not stupid at all because you guys are well adapted to your situation here, you know, like maybe not long term as a species, but everybody's just kind of doing what they got to do, you know. And LA is a short term environment. It has, it must, I feel like it screams that. Yeah, like people are here passing through to get enough to get to the next whatever they would rather be doing or an environment that would be more comfortable. It's really a almost for all, for the entire world, this is almost just like an airport, it feels like. It is, yeah. You know, it even never ends. It feels like we're still in just like a very far terminal of the airport right here. We're a podcast and even when I'm at my apartment, it feels like that. I'm like, man, I just never leave the airport. Yeah. You know, it just never ends here. What is amazing about LA is how quickly you can get way away from here. Like the hike I went on yesterday with my buddy up in the San Gabriel Mountains, I guess. Is it Eagle Rock or something? It was Dawson Saddle up to Thoup Peak, I think. Damn. Which is up at like 9,000 something hundred feet. It's gorgeous up there. We've maybe passed 10 people on the trail in four or five hours. And to you, that was busy. It was, yeah. It's like this place. This is bumper to bumper. But you can get up to that peak and look, you can have a 360 view of everything way out to, I don't know if it's Palmdale, where it's just flat desert out that way. I've been to Eagle Rock or something out there before. It was about an hour and 40 minute drive to get out there. But it was gorgeous. Was there a chairlift that if you wanted to, like it was around there in that area? We passed some chair lifts. Yeah. I think I've been up that hike before. It's absolutely amazing. Yeah. And you can see LA and downtown and the distance in the smog. And it's just like, all of that is happening down there. And nobody's up here. It's crazy, huh? Yeah. Some cool birds, some dirty bird species up there, pygmy, nut hatch. Really? Bush tit. Oh, dude, I'll show you some fucking bush tit right over here off of 101. Williamson's sap sucker. Mixing some. Definitely not on the work computers though. That's the rules we have going on around here. Yeah. National Geographic. Oh, dude, I remember jerking off back in the day to National Geographic, you know? There's a dark tit near a fire. No wonder I ended up like I did. That's a beautiful bird, isn't it? Yeah. Well, that's beautiful. Yeah. Do you think like, do you get a sense when you're up there by other animals that they know that you're a human? Do they think that you're like an anomaly or like an abnormality? Do you think like? It is kind of weird because, yeah, they're not evolved to know what we are. I guess, you know, native people have been there for 10,000 years. So maybe that's enough for some of them. Most of them run away. Like, they seem to understand that whatever you are, it's probably not good. Yeah. But I've had bird, but I've had birds laying on my head, you know, like... Oh, that's cool. Yeah. So there's some animals that seem to see you as like something to land on, I guess. Do you find that animals are still like curious about it? Like, do you find that they're curious a little bit? Like, what are animals like kind of? They're mostly just minding their own business and trying not to get eaten by something. You know, like, you ever watch a bird eating, they're just looking up every two seconds. Like, they'll take a bite and then look up and they just can't relax. Yeah. So I feel bad for them. And then the migration, you know, like, they migrate using the celestial sky. So they orient themselves to the stars and migrate that way. Really? Yeah. So they operate totally, their migration patterns, they base those all after looking at the stars and seeing what's going on? They know where the North Star is and they orient based on that. So they have these kind of like tracks in their genetics, basically. Some of them have it in there and some of them learn it. But that's, it's sad because like all these cities and all this light pollution and totally disorient them. Yeah, you got a couple of sparrows jerking off outside of Detroit for no reason. Yeah, they got to move it along. But like, but no, I could totally imagine that. Yeah, like how we're damaging like, how we're like, we don't even realize the effects that we're having. Not at all. Yeah, because most people never would have a reason to stop and think about it. Like the Twin Tower Memorial in New York, they have these two pillars of light that they put up around that time, I think in late September. And that's right during bird migration. And there's videos of literally hundreds and thousands of birds flying around and around and around, and falling to their death. And if they see a certain number of birds up there in the lights, they'll shut them off for a half an hour. But just that alone is killing probably thousands of birds a year. So that's just, that's the kind of, that's a perfect example. Yeah, perfect example. Like we're doing something that we feel like humans doing something that we feel like is honoring, you know, others that it's, you know, it's, it's out of love and, you know, support. And then even in that space, we're killing thousands of fucking birds every year. A pile on the ground. We're just trying to get to Florida. Yeah. Some guys shoveling them into the ditch in a while. Sure. But that's the thing. Yeah, there's always such an example. Yeah. Always unforeseen costs. And I think anytime you can ask yourself what is the cost of what I'm doing or what I'm participating in, you find you, you go further down the line and you realize things that you never would have figured out from the get go. And then nobody really talks about, you know, it's interesting. We try and think about that even sometimes just here with podcasts and like trying not to sell like bad products to people or like, you know, we're trying like, you know, I'm trying to think of what else. Yeah. I mean, I think we try to affect the things that are close to us. But yeah, it's interesting. It's like as you, it's so weird. It's like you grow up or I grew up anyway, I guess like I'm, you end up in working in a business or in society and it's kind of built where it's like you want to, you know, achieve things or achieve your goals. And with those, it's almost like you don't even realize the side effects that are going on or the even the chain that you're put that we're apart of the whole system we're apart of isn't even, it's not working like very like copacetic with nature all the time because we don't have to see the effects of anything we do now. Like everything happens somewhere else. Some somebody else is doing everything to produce the things that we use and depend on. So back when we were in hunter gather groups, we saw the effects of everything you did right right in front of you. Yeah, you couldn't eat everything there was because then there was nothing left right here. We just kind of pretend that there's an endless supply of everything and we create so much destruction with people like Jesus Christ and nature. Sorry, but no, you're it. Yeah, it's sad. I mean, it's almost does it get sad a little bit? It's totally sad. And that's that's one of the hardest things is like feeling so at odds with the rest of how most of society works and kind of feeling like it really shouldn't be like this. But you got to play the game a little bit. But right, you have to play the game some you have to meet people where they are you have to like, do you look at society as like, is it hard not to look at societies like oh, they're bad people, these people that we are bad? It's hard to not think that and that would just be an emotional frustrated reaction. You know, but I know everybody is in the situation they're in. And if I was in a different situation, I would be I would have, you know, less freedom to make choices to yeah, and less time to think about it. So but that's why like, where we live down south, that small village where everybody knows everybody, and you kind of help your neighbors out, you trade bananas and oranges and stuff. Yeah, teamwork. Yeah, we grow coffee. And we drink our own coffee. You know, it's nice to just when you can do something for yourself, do it because it hits this kind of instinctual feeling we have where that was a part of our genetics, you know, to be Yeah, yeah. Do you feel like we're far from that if we really tapped into it? I don't know if we are. If we are already too far beyond that or right, like if we already become too much of like, you know, zombies, you know, I think so. Like, I think every other species gets knocked back down by starvation, predation or disease, right? Every single other thing. And we keep pushing those things off. But we can't do it forever. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Yeah, I'm ready for it, man. I'm ready for it. Yeah. Like if I die in like a big, you know, thing that's crazy, it's like a, you know, a war for food or something, at least it's going to be exciting. Yeah, it can be a good couple hours of television, you know, yeah, it's going to be somebody will be filming it. Yeah, somebody will be filming it. And even if they're not, what an exciting like, how does that think about that? Like, imagine being in like a real shootout or a real like, you know, like you see a Leonardo DiCaprio fight that bear in the remnants or whatever. Yeah, that was very realistic. Yeah. And it's like, how great, like even it's almost like just to feel that alive for a minute. Yeah, yeah. You know, I was talking the other day to this UFC fighter and he was telling me like, I've seen a picture of me lost a fighter, he'd come in second. And, and I was like, man, but you still look like you had like gone through something. And he's like, man, it's crazy. He's like, every fight you go through, it's like you come out, even if you, you don't get the outcome you want. He's like, you come out the other side, there's a, you have new revelations about yourself, like at a level that you didn't really know. Yeah. Yeah. And that kind of stuff just, man, it's so enviable. Then like, sometimes just beating this drum out here, not that our lives are bad or anything, obviously, you know, like, you know, it's, it's comfortable. Yeah, for sure. But is it, I often wonder if I'm being, if I'm very much rewarded at like a level inside of me that is almost like a light that's getting dimmer and dimmer over time, because we just keep throwing these like blankets on it. You know, I think you do good things, you know, for the single moms and stuff like that. Oh, you, you've definitely had an eye for seeing things that you can do that are good and do them. Right. So, well, that's nice you to say that, man. You know, and I'm lucky, I got, you know, Nick and John, everybody's super, you know, we all kind of, you know, Nick and I have similar backgrounds and some of that. And yeah, but I think, I think even just hearing you say that, like, you know, touch the things that we can that are close to us, because I noticed what I do notice that I don't like about myself when I start saying, oh, we all need to be like this. It's like, that's when we get preachy and then we just get disconnected. Yeah, it's so disconnecting. It's like, yeah, if we're going to solve, people always point at the government. Like if we're going, the government's just us. Yeah, they're people that and they're just humans. Like if something's gonna be different, we have to make it, we have to do it. Yeah, it reflects what we said we wanted, basically. Yeah. So the problem is always down at the individual level. Yeah. But it's kind of nice. It falls back on us in the end. Like if all these cities burn, or if there's an electric outage, out of your outage, and we're never able to get it back up or something, you know, like immediately, you really quickly are going to be, your brain is going to be asking yourself, well, who am I? Like, it's gonna be a quick turn. Yeah. Who are you? And what can you do? And what can you do? Yeah, you can't do anything that's necessary. I'm going to Joe Rogans, bro. Hopefully, dude. That's where I'll be, bro. I'll be back there to skin and bison for him. That's it, bro. Yeah. If something does go down like the power, you're right. Can you imagine how quickly it would be complete chaos? Yeah. Like nobody knows how to grow anything. Nobody knows how to fix anything. The water suddenly doesn't come to your apartment. Nobody knows how to live like that. Yeah. So it's not going to be good. And I'm not going to survive it either. Like I can grow some things, but not enough to. Well, dude, you go fucking, bro, let's be honest, you could rear naked choka swan. Yeah, if I can find one. Yeah. You're gonna have a fucking swan. It's a chance we are. Me and Nick are eating Gianni. So he's got, he's built pretty well, dude. You can see his ass in the movie Ma, if you ever want to see that movie. It's a pretty decent movie. But yeah, for no reason, in the middle of the movie, they make Gianni get naked. I actually have a question show. I feel like a lot of people all the time are like, well, where do I start? There's so much like, I feel like I'm so behind like, what's something that someone could start doing like every day? Like somebody could do something where they could further themselves to help the environment instead of just destroying it. I think the Amish, like you wouldn't want to live like the Amish, right? I don't know, dude. I like not having a lot of choices, bro. Yeah. Limited choices, dude. That's a great point. Yeah. Humans do best when their choices are limited, I think. That's great to hear, actually. And if you have every new technology that comes out, the Amish asks themselves, what is this going to do to our community? And they usually come to a conclusion that they shouldn't accept this new technology. Wow. And we should do a lot more of that on the individual level, but I realize how hard it is. Like I kept off from getting a smartphone for a bunch of years longer than most people, but then I got one and I spent too much time on it and we're so easily falling into those holes. So people need to spend time outside. Like people need to get away from light pollution and noise pollution and just get to a quiet place and sit there and think a little bit. Like so many of our politicians and stuff who are making big decisions that affect everybody, most of them have never been to a wilderness area. Like they don't even know what it is to be a human animal. They just know what it is to be living in modern society and think that that's how everything has to be. Yeah. Yeah. And it's so funny even hearing like it's making me think like we think that so much like even as being in LA for a while, you start to think that everybody's similar to you, that everybody's like you. Which probably makes you have some desire to be different, which makes a lot of people act freakishly probably. Yeah. I don't know, man. Maybe not. Maybe. I mean, you might be right. I couldn't, I was listening to you, but I couldn't process what you were saying. Okay. And that's probably my, it's, you know, sometimes just fucking, you know, sometimes I go offline, man. And that's it. There's nothing I can do, dude. Sometimes I'm looking at stuff. I don't really know what's going on. Yeah. You know, but you can also like, but you know, here's what I was thinking. But it's not our fault as humans. It's like, we're just humans. Like if you're just born into the, into an environment, like it's nobody's fault. Right. Yeah. Exactly. So it's just like, I guess, what type of, what type of life do we want to know? Or what type of, yeah, what can, like what type of life do we want to live? What do we want to know? You know, what, what do we want to see is like the capabilities in ourselves. Yeah. Some cultures, especially are very happy with just like comfort and, you know, and then I think there's some people or not cultures, but some people, they just want more. They want something different. Yeah. Yeah. When things are available, it's hard to deny yourself taking them. Yeah. And so, Oh yeah. That's the British, dude. You know? Yeah. So we get blamed for slavery, but they really did it. But, um, but yeah, it's so true. Yeah. It's like when things, and it's like, I wonder if that's just the story of humans, how we're supposed to be. It's like, probably, yeah. It's like a fallacy. You know, it's just like, it's natural. Right. What we're doing is natural. And even a bird, you set a nice little thing of bread over two, you know, two branches from a bird. That guy's going to be over there. Yeah. Yeah. So once birds get these little, you know, yeah, they get a smart beak for fucking rap. A coyote ate my fiance's sandals the other day. And I was kind of surprised. Sexy kind of little. I was kind of surprised that a coyote have the spare time to be doing that kind of stuff. Like, yeah, shouldn't they be out finding something to eat? You don't tell me it's hitting everybody. Yeah, it is. It's creature comforts man. You're going to see a coyote in sandals a couple months or now. Yeah. It's interesting. Yeah. So when do you go back? When do you go back into, uh, into the great white north? Man, you're so far up there. Yeah. You're so far up there. Yeah. You're close to Asia. Yeah. People don't even realize if we get to the north of Alaska. Yeah. You're almost, you're pretty much practically Japanese. A little bit. Yeah. I've been to one of the Alaskan islands where you can see Russia. It's like 35 miles away and you just see this icy cliff. And, uh, the native folks said that they used to go back and forth because the Siberian Upex speak the same language as the ones in the Alaska side. They used to trade ladies back and forth and stuff. And now they can't anymore. And, uh, yeah. So it's a crazy environment. It's mostly treeless up, up that far north. It's, uh, north of the tree line. So you can see really great distances. And yeah, it's incredible. It comes alive in June. All the little plants start growing a little bit and flowering. The birds are all breeding. Bears are fattening up. And then by late August, it starts snowing again and everything dies. And then September, it starts getting covered in snow again. It's really life cycle. You see a real life cycle. Yeah. It's very condensed into a short period of time. Wow. And, uh, yeah. So I, once the migratory birds take off, then I basically follow them down to Costa Rica and get there and see them passing through. So it's kind of a migratory lifestyle. You ever seen one of the same birds? Yeah. Well, I haven't seen one up there and then seen the same individual down there, but I have seen birds return that have gone on migration and come back to the same exact places. So, because I've done bird research in Costa Rica and you banned them. You put a little color. Oh yeah. I've seen it on the internet. They put a little sock or something. Yeah. And so, yeah, we had, we studied golden wing warblers and they winter in Central America and breed up in Northern US and Canada. So they fly all the way there, nevying by the stars, and then pass the breeding season, don't get eaten by anything, reproduce and fly all the way back to the same patches of forest. And it's a little nine grand bird. Do you think it's just like coming home? It's just like humans. Do you think it's some of that same type of thing? Like you want to go home sometimes or that? Or is it just more of like a natural thing that they have to go right back to the same spot? Like is there a reason for it? They have territories. So they'll come back to the same spot and defend the territory even on the wintering grounds. Some of them pretty aggressively. And do they have gay birds too or not? Be honest with me. Yeah. I mean, ducks especially are... Oh yeah, in a park all the time. Yeah. And penguins. Penguins are terrible. If I was a penguin, I would be. You're out there, dude. It's a tough life, dude. Yeah. You show up to shore and there's two million of them. Yeah. Dude, you're playing a, you know, you're playing a root in anybody that's freaking, you know, willing at that point. Got a pulse or not. Yeah. I worked in Antarctic as well. So I've done... And that's the North Pole, really? The Antarctic. The South Pole? Yeah. Yeah. I worked on a sales ship, a 100-year-old Dutch tall ship that took people down to the Antarctic Peninsula from Argentina and back. And once we did a trip all the way over to South Africa from South America, the Antarctica, visited Tristan, Dakota, which is the most remote inhabited island in the whole world. Wow. It's like 400 inbred people living on this volcano in the middle of the Atlantic. 400 people, only six last names. That's beautiful, man. Yeah. Pretty cool. And what do they seem like at a certain point or do they seem really like in tune with what's going on? Or are they just like five armed and just, you know, hoping for the best? It's pretty weird. They weren't even on a monetary system until 1960. So they were just bartering and stuff. And every family has like a couple of sheep and a cow and a certain size piece of land on the side of this volcano. Wow. They were nice people, but you could tell that after being there a couple of days, they're kind of ready for you to get out of there. Oh, really? Yeah. Because you kind of what? You upset the flow a little bit? Yeah, just maybe just because like we're talking about you're supposed to know everybody in your immediate sphere. And then you have this ship sailing up and a bunch of scruffy people from Holland and stuff coming up and taking pictures of everything. I don't know. It's probably a little off-putting. Yeah, I could imagine. I'd like to go over there and we could do a group trip, you know, do a work, work trip. Yeah. Yeah. You have to sail there or take a boat there. Like there's no other way to get there because it's too far for any. And when you pull up, like what are these people doing? I mean, they're all, I mean, like you said, it's very tribal, huh? It's not really tribal. Like they're... They're all one group. Yeah. Yeah. But they're, it's not native people. That's the weird thing. They're all descended from sealers and whalers who shipwrecked there. So there's Italian descent, English descent. They have this kind of weird British accent. It's really weird. Some chicks are not, to be honest. I didn't see anybody like that. My last question for you are this, my last thing I want to think about that everybody, you know, it's obviously a big topic, always global warming, you know, like, do you, what are your thoughts, man? Do you feel like we're ruining things? Do you feel like that that's just the flow of things that, you know, that there's a cycle? Like what's some of your vibe from being up there on some of the front lines of just seeing what's happening? Yeah, where I work, there's a lot of people studying climate change. And yeah, it's very clear that it's happening. And of course, it's because of us, like, at least to a certain extent, like the amount of people on the earth burning things and using up resources, like there's no way that that wouldn't affect things. So, but to me, that's kind of like, it's a big concern. But even if we fix that, we'd still not be really getting anywhere as far as I'm concerned. And do you see like a lot of the people that are out there doing research and that kind of stuff? Do you trust all the research that they're doing? Like sometimes it just seems like, I mean, people these days, especially you can create any, any, any belief you want. And I'm not denying climate or anything like that. I'm saying like, but you know, people can create anything they want. Everybody has a technology to create any story that they want to. Yeah. Do you see some of that, like some of it seems like kind of motivated, like in like negative ways? Or do you feel like it's, it's honest, just research, like people want to know what's going on? I think the research is pretty honest, trying to document what's going on. But you definitely see people studying things that they know they'll be able to get funding for. So that. Right. So you have to, yeah, you almost have to, you have to plan ahead because you want to get the funding. Yeah. Because you, yeah, even if your idea is too obtuse sometimes, though it could be more helpful. Yeah. A government agency or something, they're not going to do the funding for that. Exactly. It's going to sound crazy to them. Yeah. Wow. But it's a, yeah, it's a great place. And there's up to 150 people there during the peak of the summer. There's only about three people there during the winter, most of the time, just three people losing it. And a little bit of murder every now and then? No, there's never been any real, that's the thing is like, I don't know, we look back at hunter gatherer, people are small groups of people and think that it was all violence all the time. It really wasn't like it was occasional skirmishes with neighboring groups and stuff, but like it wasn't that bad. There was high infant mortality, but if you made it through that, you generally lived a pretty normal lifespan. Yeah, babies die, especially if you got an open fire going on. I know, yeah. Babies are risky, you know. And they would let them crawl into it. It's crazy, just to see what the gods wanted. Yeah, or just to let the strong survive. It's just different values. It's like one of those Tony Robbins things. It's just different value systems, you know, that we can't imagine taking part in, but if we were born there, we'd think it's totally normal. Right. You know what I'm saying? I almost feel like a little bit, not embarrassed, I guess, talking to you a little bit, but like, I almost feel a little ashamed of our own existence a little bit, not from you as a person, but just like thinking about that because you never think about it, you know? Like you never really, I don't know, or I don't anyway. A lot of people might and I wish I did more. And I think you actually reached out to me originally saying, Hey man, you should go on some hikes. You should you should. I think that's how we kind of crossed paths. Is that right? Yeah, I called in with this one call. Oh, that's right. Okay. Yeah. Because then I know we've communicated every million, you've sent me some very beautiful pictures and we're going to put some of those up throughout the episode. And like just kind of filling me in like every now and then I'll get a, you know, like an email just letting me know what's going on with some crazy birds. Yeah. I'm like, okay. And I'll tell somebody next to me and they don't give a fuck. Right. Yeah. They do not care. But yeah. Yeah, you shouldn't feel embarrassed or anything like I know I feel ashamed a little bit as a human. There's a little bit of that that starts up. Yeah. Well, that's good. I think we should all have a little bit of that because we at the expense or what we demand for our like standard of living creates a lot of destruction. So we should be ashamed of it. We should be aware. We should do some work to become aware of our effects on the world. Cause just to be a good neighbor to other things, you know? Yeah. That would be nice. But I know it sounds preachy and I know that most people are just getting up and having to work and not don't have the time to think about that stuff. But it sounds hopeful though. Also, I think in a little bit, I think, I don't think it sounds preachy. Yeah. I don't think you sound preachy at all. I think it sounds like studied and hopeful, you know? I'm not hopeful. Right. At all. Maybe I want you to be. Yeah. I wish, man. Yeah. Damn, bro. Just when you fly into LAX, man, like, Oh, yeah. down at that. I'm not asking you have hope around here. Okay. But no, I look, it's like, especially here, like, you know, everybody look, people here look down. They have no empathy for like people in other parts of like, especially America, smaller towns where people are like, what do they do? They're all they're doing is like having a lot of trying to have a good life, be loving more to their neighbor. Yeah. And not get overwhelmed with things that don't kind of make their spirit feel good. Yeah. Yeah. They're more into you have more people that can hunt more people that can grow. Yeah. I agree, man. I mean, that kind of stuff makes me furious. Yeah. It's hard when there's some parts of rural living that aren't good, you know, like, there's the massive opioid addiction issues. But I think that stems from them being dismissed by everybody else. And oh, yeah. Industries like coal coming in and taking all the money away and leaving people sick and stuff. Yeah. So it's not surprising at all. Yeah, it's not surprising at all when people feel like left out. Yeah. And it's happening in the village in Costa Rica, too, where everybody's everybody's being raised to think if you get out of this village, you're a success. If you get a college degree, it doesn't matter what you end up doing. Or if you never see your family again, that's a success. And we kind of did that in this country, too. Yeah. And people are separated from their families and it's happening down there. And it's kind of like a, I think some of that could change though. Yeah. I think some of that could really change. I hope so. I believe that because I think people are starting to realize that there's just such a, there's such a, with not certain parts of America like LA used to control like what would happen in Hollywood and in media and that sort of thing. And it's going away now. So I think a lot of people who are dreamers or who want to be creators, I think they, I think a lot of these people are hopefully going to start to want to build up the places that they're from or the places that they live. Because there's such a bottleneck here. There's such a bottleneck in certain places that a lot of the best creativity never gets to be seen. Yeah. Even though if it were spread out a little bit more, it would really flourish. Yeah. Did you have any people believing really wild things where you grew up like rural superstitions or anything? Yeah. We have a woman we're friends with down in the village who. We're down in Costa Rica. Yeah. So 40 years ago when she was pregnant, they had an outhouse out in the backyard and she had to go to the bathroom at night. And she didn't feel like, she didn't feel like walking all the way to the outhouse. So she just went behind the house. Oh yeah, men. Yeah, that's men. When she looked down after she peed, there was a Fertilance pit viper coiled up right there. And she said, it didn't bite me. And she always preferences this kind of stuff with, I know you're not going to believe me, but it didn't bite me because the urine of pregnant women is electrified. Wow. So she thinks a snake was sitting there like. Scared? No, electrocuted. I could see that. Yeah. I could see. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Dude, if something pissed on me that was pregnant dude, I'd take the afternoon off easily, man. Yeah, I'd probably enjoy the warm rain sensation. I mean, I'll just take the afternoon off, man. I mean, that's really as dark arts as you can get. Yeah. Dude, you have to come back and let us know what's going on out there, you know, any warning signs, you know, like any real huge flare ups. But I certainly appreciate you coming Seth and just talking to us about, you know, what it's like by the North Pole up by Alaska and like, and they never built a sand or anything like that up there, right? Yeah, actually, South of Fairbanks is a town called North Pole, where they have a giant Santa statue and a sad little reindeer in a pin. And you can go sit on Santa's lap and stuff. It's a little dark artist. Yeah. And they're also, it seemed like they're trying to make a statement with the reindeer in the pan. Are they or no? Or is it just, it's a real reindeer? It's real, but it's not a real good one. It's looking pretty sad. Wow, look, David. There's so little, there's like 30 reindeer left. Yeah. But that's, you know, when you see animals in the zoo, and they're walking in circles and stuff, I kind of draw a parallel between that and human society. Like, they have food, they have shelter. So in a sense, you think they're fine. Right. But why are they walking in circles? Like, same with us. Like, we're safe. Generally, we've got food. Don't have to worry about all that much. Why are people so unhappy? Yeah. Because there's something that Tiger, who walks around the cage all day long, is missing. Yeah. Same for us. I like that. It's a good thought, man. We got to break out of the zoo. Yeah. But we also have to, yeah, we have to break out of the zoo. We just have to do it. We got to take in a food with us. I don't know if I can choke a stork out. You know. But yeah, I agree with you, man. Thanks for coming, man, and hanging out. Thanks for having me. I really appreciate it, man. It's great to meet you in person. Yeah, you too. Likewise.",

Chris de Stefano every Thursday wherever you listen to your podcasts I'm just sitting on your front porch wondering how could I be so far from my home and my mind is somewhere else but when I find it I'll patch up where it's been now I'm just holding on the breeze and I feel I'm falling like these leaves I must be cornerstone but when I reach that ground I'll share this piece of mind I found I can feel it come on but it's gonna take a little time for me to set that parking brake and let myself on why shine that light on me come on now I'll sit and tell you my story shine on me and I'll leave you for the fall I will sing it just for you and that is you know shine by bishop gun grateful to them for being alive in the same time period as we are or as I am anyway I can't speak for you but oh and you think about that what if you were in some people you might not get to know somebody because they born at a different time period think about that think about that oh do you know uh you know Carol you know little Carol and people are like I don't know her yeah because she was born in 1804 oh well then yeah don't know her think about that what about big Samuel you know big Samuel with the braids he got the French braids and he you know he always selling bags of yeast down there by the river you know yeasty Sam no I don't where's he from oh you know he's from you know by the river banks no when how old is he go he's about 25 you know he was born in in 1834 oh well don't know him can't know him and they just wow what if what if your best friend you know isn't even born yet they're gonna be born in two years and you and you so you missing out because y'all's time isn't synced up think about that you so you next thing you know you're milling around a preschool and people like hey you was you know hey hey hey hey hey hey Judy hey Judy what you're doing out here by the preschool and Judy says oh well you know little ah little Cecile you're right there the four-year-old I think we got vibes you know friendship vibes you know buddies you know you know vegeta you know teamwork team tits hashtaggers you know friendship and they're like oh nah you know you 25 years older than her so you can't hang out here gonna call the police you know timing is so important that you know timing is important and that you never know sometimes you might miss your best friend because you the timing wasn't right you know you might be your best friend might be four and you might be 61 but y'all you know and now and now you can't even be friends with somebody because the law says it's fucked up or the law says it's wrong it's wrong if a senior citizen wants to be buddies with a seven-year-old with somebody that's in second grade and wants to you know hang out with them on the weekends or whatever and do cigarettes or whatever it's interesting timing how important it is I'll tell you about this timing so I just crossed to the international date line and I thought it was gonna be a really good episode hosted by Lester Holt but it isn't it is um it is a line let me research it for you real quick international date line here's what it is it was established in 1884 it passes through the mid-pacific ocean and follows a 180 degrees longitude north south line on the earth so that means it's up and down it's long it's top to bottom you know it's uh it's it's a horizontal no it's vertical line it's located halfway around the world from the prime meridian and when you cross it the day changes well it's an imaginary line also it's not really real so you can't get out there and you know you're not gonna see a big twizzler running from the north pole to the south pole or something you're not gonna see a you know any buoys or anything like that or you know a guy out there with a whistle pointing you know Thursday this way Wednesday that way you know it's just it's where the day changes anyway I crossed it when I flew to Australia and back and I'm now back here in the US on US soil and I'm back here and I'm in a new studio we're in a new studio so if you're on the YouTube's is you know this is different it's different in here we have more space hello might sound different in the back when I yell hello and nobody's listening so just you know some changes going on I walk damn I'm nervous you know I'm never I walk in and I'm in my mind it's like oh well it's just gonna be it's gonna feel suddenly like home and it's gonna be you know nothing everything will be kind of set up and everything will be but you know we have a couch that you know premature Nick he got it on it you know so we have some furniture we got a chair we have a couple bags had some croissant somebody had that are empty now from the coffee bean couple couple C bags couple croissant bags and we have a lot of empty space and a lot of possibility those are the things that we have in here so yeah just a lot going on at the second you know being in a new place getting home having to come into the into the studio and decide okay do I want to be confident when I get in here you know because Nick's here Gianni is here with their new movie his new movie is out now the movie ma ma and go see it it's basically like it's like fraternities meet kind of interracial dating I think is what it is it's kind of like you know what is that called it's like kappa apartheid alpha omega or something like that it's like yeah it's just you know it's got kind of a hurt it's really good it's scary we'll see I'm gonna go check it out but we're definitely excited that you know to support him and be supportive of him the but yeah man I got in here and I just didn't I was like man okay do I be nervous do I just be confident don't walk in here and act like okay I know everything we're gonna do and and you know Nick and Gianni had already been here they move stuff in so they've had a little more acquaintance and they were just excited they were excited about the opportunity and so you know I just I just tried to ride their excitement because I honestly just a little bit scared I guess you know like taking on new responsibility all the rent in here is twice as much you know the walls don't look the same not to mention the other place is gone you know the other studio is not it you know everything's out of there so it's I mean it still exists like in a location inside of us but in our memory and in in time but it doesn't exist the same anymore right now and so we're here we're in something new it's like we're traveling like when a baby comes out the body you know when a baby comes out the body they got think about all of that first the baby's been in there getting jacked up on you know on that mom sauce whatever mom's been having sweet potatoes chocolate pickles a little bit of frickin gin you know maybe a little bit of vom Mayer's rum or something at night especially if it's winter time a little bit of that you know what is that egg batter and cognac or whatever the eggnog so the baby you know when they decide to leave the womb they really that's a brave move cuz it's basically they're just there in there laying up in there it's like being at the Hampton Inn but the room kind of you know but nobody's the maid hadn't come and cleaned your room in a while and they got a lot of you know they got you the baby you're in that little Hampton Inn inside of your mother they got the fessies over there and they got the you know just a bunch of pita hut little you know boxes from all the snacks you've been having you got to go and then you you know you slide out of your mother out into the world and it's a new experience and that's where we are right now in this new experience so yeah just nervous excited for the opportunity hopeful I think I had a moment where I was like oh wow I'm part of like it's you know I really have to be more part of a team right now then I'm just you know because I need I need help I need help from my co-workers and I'm just you know I'm grateful to have them man I got just got back from Australia and I just I gotta say it was amazing the last show they had 3,000 people in Brisbane Brisbane Australia and man I can't I'm trying to think of like what if I just I don't know it feels like you can't thank everybody enough it feels like you know you walk out there I felt like damn Joel Austin out there you know I felt like I wish I had a big water gun full of holy water and just you know just filling people's mouths up from 50 yards away you know just just just just pressure washing the devil off of people it was just you know it was like a bit it was just it was interesting and then it's hard to tell if people are laughing as much when it's in a big space but I got such a great response just from people over social media and then we went to the koala park and saw the koalas and saw the kangaroos and if you never seen a kangaroo they it's like it's like when they it's kind of like the first time somebody tells you oh that's your cousin or your second cousin or they introduce you to your uncle that you never met you're like damn uncle Ronnie got some short arms and a big ass you know oh dang you know uncle Ronnie's out there eating leaves off of the off of the shrubbery like damn it may it made me I was shocked at that huge that that their species I was shocked that we're all have you know atoms in us that are similar because a kangaroo was like something you know it's basically a kangaroo is like the El Camino of the animal kingdom it is the it is the it's got a fucking it's got a I don't know what it is got like a dragon tail it got that it's got the body of a arm kind of like a thick girl like a real thick bitch that likes to fight you know kind of like a thick girl that doesn't you know that likes to thumb-rassle real heavily with others and it and then it's got the head of like a kind of a dog like a um Doberman like a lean Doberman that's on keto diet sugar-free Doberman that SFD and it's it just it blows your mind you're like holy shit this is an animal now and that's Australia it's got unique animals it's got unique animals and you know what one thing I loved about Australia I'll say this Australia is that there's a country that I've visited that I could go easily see myself to live in it would be Australia and then one of the things that I loved is that they still have a strong sense of being Australian it feels like it felt like to me this is my perception and at the airport you could still go say body or loved ones or you could meet somebody at the gate so it's just really beautiful because you still see like a lot of like what it means to travel and be somewhere new like in America you can't see that anymore I remember when I was young your mom could walk you to the gate and watch you cry in the little tunnel as you flew off to meet grandma and that's natural you know if you're a child and you're about to fly four hours to see some senior citizens I mean I don't make I don't bring a tear to anybody's eye and especially if you if you if you step grandfather is addicted to Marlboro Reds and he does them indoors and shit and you can't eat you know so right after dessert right after a couple cups of pudding at grandma you got to sit there and and get that secondhand smoke off a poppy but but yeah man the one of the things about that is you when you see people hug at the gate and you see people like say goodbye to each other at the gate like you could in Australia you see like human affection you see human interaction and it makes you kind of it gives like more of a meaning to what travel is and so I saw I would see that at the different place and we flew I think to I think we had maybe seven flights or six flights within the country once we got there and you you're like oh wow this is oh yeah this person is coming to see someone this person is leaving someone they care about and and it just it reminded me of that time in the US when you could do that you could go to the gate and greet somebody and greet a loved one you didn't have to have a ticket you could still be there to see them come or to see them go and I miss that it just added so much more meaning to travel it added so much more meaning to coming and going because you saw others you know just to see somebody say goodbye to someone it's like oh wow that's human interaction this that's connection to see somebody give a kiss to somebody that they that they you know maybe they they're not gonna see them for you know a couple weeks or a couple months or who knows how long and in your mind you process oh I wonder I wonder if they you know if this is their first time this ever their first weekend that they ever hung out and it was great and now one of them's leaving or if they've been together for years and one of them's leaving you get to see a kid get get to the gate and run up and and his uncle is there to give him a big hug and you know or the grandpa or the grandpa and grandma are there see him hug the baby and lift up the baby for the first time you get to see that and it just you know I think that's to me that's when something happened in America years ago when something changed a lot was right around that time and I feel like it was after 9-11 when that things just got a lot stricter and a lot more serious and and and we started to take out some of the things that reminded us how human we are but that's one thing I loved about Australia was seeing that that's one of the honestly my favorite things about the country was just seeing that getting to see that at the airport at the airport when we get in and when we leave it was just I don't know I liked it you know I like just seeing I liked seeing humans be able to I don't know just express some of their feelings and have a space to do that or or just I don't know I just it reminded me that I was human a little bit more it reminded me that I was amongst others it just seeing connection is seeing it just I don't know it did say it was something different it was something that I wasn't used to you know I saw some exotic animals but one of the most exotic things I saw was people display in human interaction in public at the airport flight gates what else was my experience like I just have so much going through my head right now like I can't even tell you just being in this place and just a lot a lot of cool stuff but thank you so much to everybody you know went to Perth if you've been to Perth or not in Australia but it's basically it's like somebody it you know it's it almost looked like it went out of business and then they just restarted it back up and we went to Brisbane where else oh went to Adelaide that was wild it was like kind of a sleepy time I couldn't tell what place was kind of like what like if okay if this city is more like Chicago or if this city is more like New York or if this city is more like Tampa I think I needed more time people think a lot of times that the trip when you're touring doing a shows that it's like vacation it's not it's work you know it's a lot of come and go and I just want to thank so many nice people reached out and brought gifts there's still a couple gifts that people brought me to the last show that I haven't even opened up yet some nice t-shirts and MMA guys came and one of them had a move called the hard scarf that you know this guy in my neighborhood used to put people in somebody wore a RIP Billy Confarto shirt it was it was a next level man it was next level I just can't believe it I'm like how did all these people know that I was coming I mean I mean I know they know because like the podcast and because of social media but it just doesn't it didn't didn't add up really into my head like that this many people would would be here and so I just want to say thank you and we did it you know we did it you know that's one thing I'm realized when I walk on that stage and that there's people out there is that we did this and that if you are somebody who is wondering if you can do something that you want to do I'm not like preaching at you or anything but but honestly man I've doubted myself every every step along the way I've doubted myself and and I still doubt myself but I've but I have not but I but I'm but I'm doing it but I'm doing it but I'm not but I haven't really stopped my feet from moving forward you know and I'm not telling you that to preach it or anything I just I'm just trying to find a way to share some of my experience in case there's somebody like me you know who wonders wolf what do I do you know if I want to do you know chase a dream or do this or do that and there's a little voice inside of you whatever it is that will tell you the right thing to do next or it'll it'll convince you from time to time and sometimes that little voice might even be the voice of somebody outside of you that catches your frequency and and yeah just I don't know I'm saying I could think I'm selling kind of preachy I'll tell you this though a couple weeks ago this company free fly apparel sent me some snazzy shirts and I mean snazzy like if you want to look nice but not like you know you're going to the prom or you're going to like you know they're opening up a new power plant in your town and that and it's cut and they're doing a ribbon cutting like dude look if you got a power plant I don't you know I'll stay home sound like somebody might get electrocuted but free fly can have you looking however you want to look the clothes are made from butter soft bamboo and look I got to say you think bamboo you like you know we've all we've all heard the story about the boy in my neighborhood growing up whose dad made him a arm a wooden shirt but when you wearing that butter soft bamboo you ain't really shocked if they are if a koala or a panda rolls up and tries to chew on your shirt sleeve it's surprisingly comfortable in fact it makes you feel like you're wrapping yourself in a little bit of Costa Rica or something exotic but so soft you like is this bamboo is this shampoo this

apparel dot com promo code TPW oh let's take a call actually you know what I want to talk about this I was man on this past tour you know I was out of town for three weeks and I want to thank you guys for putting up with everything while we were out of the studio and you know it's one thing I noticed was I was I was you know they had a tour manager so a tour manager so somebody like kind of meets you along the tour and takes you you know like takes you from one city to the next and just make sure you kind of know what's going on in each place especially since it's international and I realized like I found myself getting real antsy with the with the tour management group and they were great I just noticed about myself like man I would get real short with them when I'd see them in the morning I would be like and I would be like just like a just a kind of like a cranky kid and I was thinking like what the fuck is going on man like I don't behave this way what is going on and I started to realize it took me man it took me probably the first four cities I think they didn't really know what like by the end of the day I would be nicer but in the beginning I was just so like I was just short with people I wouldn't look them in the eyes and I wasn't like I was being mean I was being mean right but I wasn't doing it on purpose I was just uncomfortable I just didn't feel good and I knew that I was not feeling good I just didn't know what to do and I started to realize that I don't like I don't like it when people have to help me like I don't like getting help from other people you know I want to do stuff on my own like I can do it that's what I think to myself I can I don't need help I can do this you know I don't want anybody to help me you know I don't need anybody I can do it better or I can do I can do it and I'm just kind of talking about that because you know I needed help I just didn't want to admit it I didn't want to I don't know I was just all I just always been so used to doing things for myself that that I didn't want to say that I couldn't do them for myself or that I wanted to even let somebody else have the opportunity to help me I didn't want anybody to have the opportunity to help me because if you help me then somehow that's like a weakness of mine if you help me then it shows me that that I'm able that I'm capable of like connecting then I'm in a weakness because I'm trying to get these words right if I let you help me why don't I like people helping me because I can do it myself and if you realize that I and if I let you see that I can't do it myself or if I let you help me then it I'm just trying to get these I'm trying to get my feelings hooked to my words sorry if this kind of all over the place but this is just something that's really really really hit me this on this trip because I never had this type of experience you know I just didn't want to look people in the eyes I didn't want to like if I needed like if you were helping me I didn't want you to see see the look in my eyes that look that showed that I knew you were helping me I was keeping that to myself like I just didn't want I didn't want to be someone who needs help because to me it was like a weakness you know it was like it gave you like an ability to connect with me that I just wasn't ready for you know I'm fine with being friends I'm fine with you know joking around I'm fine with having fun but when it came to a moment where I needed you because you knew something that I didn't or that you when it came to a moment where I was gonna show you that I couldn't help myself or that that was a moment I just couldn't do I couldn't do those moments where it looked like I couldn't fend for myself I don't know I know some of that's all over the place and I'm sorry but I was really just trying to figure it out I'm just me I just don't like that you know I like to be able to do things I'm just so used to it like I think at a level even inside of me in the fabric of me like in the stitching of my core you know I think I just realized at a certain point in my life but you know when at a youthful point that or something or even when I was a zygote that I'm gonna have to do this myself and and that's what I'm gonna do and so I'm not I'm never not gonna do that it's almost like I made a deal with myself like I'm never not gonna do this myself and so now that the touring gets a little different and people are on board and people are helping it's like it's really tough for me to let somebody help me that's one thing I've kind of realized it's really really tough for me to let somebody help me and it and it almost have an adverse reaction to it because if I show you that I need help from you then that means that that that gives you an ability to connect with me and that's scary to me I think so that's why I think I don't know some of this stuff I need to do a little bit more of work on and think about but it was just something that was heavily on my mind so I wanted to share it with you guys but thank you so much to everybody in Australia that came out I'm happy to be back home I have some jet lag I just literally about seven minutes ago just got hit by jet lag pretty heavy which is a tough tough thing to try and explain how you're feeling at the same time and I'm sorry for taking you guys on that wormhole but I just don't wish I knew exactly what I was thinking more man I just it really it really hurts me somewhere to admit that I need help or to admit that I that I'm not doing something by myself you know it just makes me feel scared it's a scary thing and I didn't know that until I was on this experience and I'm in another country and you know there's a group people that are helping out and they're helping and I'm just I was so upset and I couldn't figure out why and I wasn't upset with the audience or like the shows or I didn't there wasn't anything like that it was all just you know behind the scenes and and so I'm grateful that the tour manager and and their company like put up with me for a couple days while figured it out and then I started going to some different 12-step meetings and it helped me kind of calm down and get into a better space but anyway enough about that man I want to take a couple of calls that came in here we go what's up Christian over there in Ohio thank you for calling man onward I am 40 years old and you said something not that long ago you said something like I'm afraid to let myself grow up with the things without the things I always wanted because they're not there and it made me think a lot and I was like wow there's a lot of things that I thought I would have by the time I'm 40 or things that I thought I would do and try and stand up with there's something that was a bucket list item but I never really thought I don't know it's like it was something I would have to work a long time to be able to do one time and yeah man I just wanted to give it a shot so tonight we got about five minutes and then I'm gonna give it a go so thank you for the inspiration and the last and all that so yeah word man well thank you for calling in with that dude good luck with that first time wow yeah look I think sometimes that it's like you know we create these store we have these stories that get built into us that we can't do certain things you know I was just talking with a friend of mine yesterday you know she's going on a vacation and she just spent you know like $5,000 to go on a vacation which is a big sum of money and it's a vacation and you know and she said you know I just I never knew if I could she's like as I'm spending the money she's like I've something felt wrong about it and she's like I was it felt wrong because I was spending the money on something that I wanted to do for myself and not spending the money on just some like oh you have to save for this or you have to save for that or you have to have this savings plan or it was like it was it was like against the norm it was just me spending money on something that I wanted for myself even a good experience like travel like you can't just up and travel for a month and she's like yes I can she's like and as I did it it just felt so wrong but at the same time it just felt so kind of perfect like oh this is what I'm supposed to do this is I'm supposed to do things that I want to do in the world I'm supposed to do new experiences I'm not just supposed to save every dime and put it away in this shoebox or put it away for this and have safe keeping and and never try the things I always wanted to try and it really hit me I was like wow that's so interesting when yeah when you spend money on something that you kind of want sometimes especially like a thing like travel or a musical instrument or or doing something that's that you've always wanted to do but that's out of the societal norm it feels foreign almost to us because sometimes we get the built into this world where it's like oh this is the next thing oh you go to cut you go finish school then you go to college then you did get this and then you get a job and then you get another job and then you it's like well what if we didn't do it that way what if one day I just said to my boss hey I'm gonna go for a month in travel which is what my friend is doing you know she said I'm gonna go for a month in travel and then I bought the ticket and next thing you know I feel like I'm wandering out into a whole different world of interaction with life than I have been previously because I'm doing something that I want to do but yeah like you said it's like you think it can take you know you thought stand up with something you had to try you know work out for a long time just to get them and even try dude I remember I drove across the causeway about 30 miles I've been upset my whole life that my dad was so old when I was born and I've been making fun of them in my head to make me feel okay about him being so old and then I just stood up on stage and started telling jokes about it and so it was just you know it's and everybody has their own experience but getting up and talking about something that's just been running around in your head you know a lot of the work for trying stand-ups already been done you've been alive that's the research the research for doing stand-up in the practice is being alive now the repetition is something that takes you know time but the ability for it for you to do it to have the gunpowder that's already packed inside of you and the microphone that's just the that's the flint and that's what's gonna light it but let's hear the rest of your call thank you for calling in Christian yeah man right I wanted to thank you and share the fact that I'm gonna get up on stage later today and either shit myself or make some people that so gang brother and I hope it went good let's take another call here here we go the hotline is always is nine eight five six six four nine five zero three what's up do you know my name is Kate I've been seeing a girl for about a year and a half now and what's up Kate thank you for calling you've been seeing a girl for a year and a half that's a long time these days that's a that's almost like a first marriage onward and we've been on and off so we were never truly official and I guess maybe that's partially my fault and I could admit that but uh basically what's happened here is about three weeks ago I finally asked this girl to be my girlfriend there you go boy you're sliding in and that that deal deal deal oh you want that oh would you be my boyfriend my girlfriend let's hear more and she said yes which is awesome but my best friend let me know that uh he hooked up with this girl about a month and a half ago when we weren't officially together so I'm dealing with this whirlwind of emotions feeling mad feeling bad feeling betrayed and not really sure what to do and it does seem like it was a mistake that they both regret but I just feel hurt man and I'm trying to figure out how to move forward with this so give any advice is the path to forgiveness the right way to go gang gang you're the man gang gang bro I'm barely a man by genetic coding only man the rest of me it's hit or miss some days dude because I can be a real bad you know this makes me think okay when I was when I was when I was in school when I was in high school I was in love with this girl and she had been seeing some guy before me that she lost her virginity too right and and you know what I'm saying some girls you know you they lose the virginity and then see then you come along and you you take their West virginity and that's usually you know b-hole sex that's the b-hole deal is their West virginity but but anyway that was just that was just kind of a joke but what I'm saying is this man I never got over the fact that she had already hooked up with some of the guy before we got together I never got over it I always let it just fester on me and just this weird jealousy it gave me a thing to be angry about and in the end that shit was all about me man it was you know it had nothing to do with her this girl has just been living her life you know and the guy that she'd hooked up with I actually really liked that guy and he was a friend of mine and you know and it when you're young it's hard to not be jealous but I would just say fucking man at least two people you know at least you know you're in the right ballpark because if they've already hooked up then you're really the missing link you know it's like oh if you're if you're friends with one of them you like the other one you know I think you could probably get past it pretty quick I would just you know it's really gonna be super met it's gonna be the move is to get past it it's gonna be super macho of you and you don't even need to tell them you forgive them just you got to do it inside of yourself I think you know that's what I wish I would have done now what I did here's something else you could do what I did was hold it against the girl bring it up all the time we were drunk fight about it cry about it in the front yard cry about it in the backyard you could go my route and you might not be reward I mean it's it's a painful route to go you end up laying on your back out in the street in the middle of the night smoking menthols bruh smoking them fucking a pack of Winston menthols limited editions 110s dude you ever smoked a pack of 110 menthols doc come on boy dude the thing so the uh the cherry so big on the end of those cigarettes damn mosquitoes show up for it and things wild so I would say yeah man I go I go that forgiveness right and be that big dog be the big dog you still got the best friend you still got the girl so they hooked up one time oh well you know do you do whatever you got to do you know and if you got two years later maybe if the guy you know you know maybe years from now the guy uh you know you have an opportunity you know maybe he breaks up with the girl and you hook up with her and then y'all are even if you want to you know do it games a throne style but otherwise I'd just let it ride man you know you just don't want to miss out on the opportunity for a good relationship with a girl because of some jealousy especially if your if your dude isn't like you know still trying to holler at her I think that's the move but also bro fuck do I know son but gang man be good to yourself you know what I was thinking was this man I'd love to know a lot of guys you know we we did this a couple years ago a lot of girls or guys if you want to hit the hotline with this we can put some of these calls in the first time you touch somebody's crotch you know of the opposite sex or it could also even be your own crotch that OC the first time you know we had a woman a couple years ago she called in and the first time a guy touched her little you know that little uh you know what I'm talking about that little Vietnamese hot pocket you feel me that vagina was in a refrigerator box in an empty refrigerator box out back in the garage and everybody has a secret a sexy little story like that you know you snuggled up in the refrigerator box with a young lover and they touch your crotch for the first time because dude I remember when I was young bro my crotch was like the center of the universe boy I mean they would have a falcon would come and land on my crotch at night and look out over the lands you know your crotch was the only thing remember

almost happy early father's down there that's coming up I'm not sure if you're a father but you could be I think you're you're just the greatest storyteller of this time well that's nice you to say that man you know we don't do much to keep stories alive anymore you know I feel like they're dying you know I feel like a lot of people don't care what the story is a in in media these days they just want to just put out something quick and easy and even stories have become clickbait and so I'm just I feel very blessed to have the gift to even tell a story but thank you for the nice words onward but anyway my name is Dylan I'm from Florence Alabama I work for the railroad and a lot of times I'm a conductor so a lot of times we get on the train you know we'll get to different places and stuff like that one of the places we go is Memphis, Tennessee or Memphis some people will call it you know oh yeah and that's Memphis and they used to have if you drove outside of Memphis about an hour you could go to Graceland too and they had a man out there doing Graceland I guess you know he got upset that Elvis had done it and he said well damn I'm gonna do my own you go there at night and me and two of my friends one went there one night and and the man wasn't there you could knock on his door and he would take you on a tour museum of his own house and it was all Elvis memorabilia it's called Graceland 2 and what happened was uh we went there and my friend got bit by a damn huge fucking dog showed up and bit my friend and it was a black dog or black and brown so I don't know that isn't I mean it's not there's nothing to do with it but it uh but yeah we had to take my buddy the hospital and all kinds of shit so we never got to go inside but anyway let's hear more it's a pretty rough area there man and you know it's one of those places where if you don't know where you are in Memphis you might not need to stop at the gas station oh yeah if you don't know where you are in Memphis you might be dead I don't know if you've seen 48 hours but a lot of that the first 48 sorry and it's about people in Memphis shooting each other and then the cops kind of don't know who it is but they know who it is let's hear more some place is there they call the gas station's murder marks well the barbecue chips boy you better get your chips quick son so but anyway I just want to know what you think if you ever been to Memphis what you think about it about the area and stuff like that but but anyway gang gang brother gang gang man I mean I think you have a lot of cities in America where they have you know some of the crime problem has gotten a little bit out of hand in specific areas you know Memphis is one of those places where you're getting a lot of crime you know places you see a lot of poverty you know you have a lot of it places where you see also a lot of poverty in black community you have a lot of you have a lot of crime you know because it over time it's been one of the more impoverished you know and also they have a lot of like a lot of gangsters and and that sort of thing and you know you see a lot of those guys with you know also you know making like guns and murder and that type of stuff look cool so I think you that's something you probably have in Memphis is a lot of that you know in New Orleans they have it Chicago has it New Orleans it seems to be getting real bad or just the newspapers say there is if you go to nolla.com it's you know it just seems to be something that happens in some of these communities where it's hard to it's like how do you eradicate this problem I think some of it is time you know as you get you know as more opportunity you have more opportunity and a lot of diff for different you know for different ethnicities and in America more opportunity to make money then you'll see you know more comfortable lifestyles where it won't be as much you know as much crime and as much poverty but yeah I think sometimes the onus could also be taken on by some of these individual communities it's like you know it would be you know it's like how does how do you stop this kind of stuff within these communities it's like I would love you know and maybe that this does happen I just don't see it it's like how do you stop like black-on-black violence like you know it's scary sometimes to I remember growing up in Louisiana it would be scary sometimes to have a black friend because if a lot of black guys got murdered and you just would read about it every day on the newspaper see it on the news like damn man that's scary you know it and then I think it's not a it gives a scary vibe to you know it's I can't even imagine do being a young black guy in some of those places would be scary and look I'm sure it's all types of ethnicities and it's all types of people and stuff so I don't even know what I'm talking about but I think over time some of that will go away but some of it is it's just like we got a you know like if we if we continue to champion this sort of like that it's cool to be like a gangster and that kind of shit then I don't know if that kind of stuff gets helped you know some of it's a culture thing some of it's a like what's cool but then also it might be fun as fuck to be a straight-up gangster bra be running around at night playing you know you know all the the kids that you know have two parents and a little bit of cash they're inside playing modern warfare and the kids who's out there struggling those dudes are out there fucking running ducking over about a murder mark trying to drink a fucking get through all 32 ounces before they go to that big gulp in the sky the Lord before they go see the Lord it's the freaking murder mark but all aboard bra you know I get that bulletproof train son get that bulletproof glass on the front of the train all aboard but yeah Memphis fuck dude first 48 gives a bad vibe to that city in the sense that you just everybody's shooting at each other over there it always seems like but yeah I think sometimes that's a community problem where it's like how do you you know like it you know it's it's everybody's problem but it's also it's like within certain communities you have some things that just after a while seems like are these things gonna go away or maybe they are going away and the media's just keeps playing them up and acting like they aren't you know I don't know I wish I kind of knew more sometimes but you know the fuck do I know man let's hear another call here we go a co my name's Kyle lock I'm from Seattle Washington what's up Kyle and I'll be up there in two weeks up there in Seattle onward I just wanted to talk to you about folly and me and my fiance are going there for a honeymoon in the end of July

gonna be over in Bali I recommend it I recommend you stay in changu or you get even more rural than changu that's where I was semen yak seems a little too too much going on you can get out into if you really want to be by the beach just find a more rural place I think as long as you get like a little villa or something the more rural the better but the people are so kind you're gonna really be able to relax you know I would try to keep my phone off as much as possible and just do your best to to spend time together I think it sounds like you guys are really gonna knock it out of the park you know you could rent scooters but I also enjoy just getting you know a little scooter and getting on somebody's back and holding on to somebody you don't know taking a chance you know it's the closest I've been to a successful relationship really was jumping on the back of a scooter and not even if it was a man or woman in the helmet and just you know and just riding with him taking a chance man so but yeah fresh fruit you know just drink bottled water you know that drill yeah I'm trying to think of anything else like I didn't do I don't do a lot of night life or anything so I was low-key up early it was beautiful man it was beautiful I don't think you I don't think that you could go wrong let's take another call right here this is Bruce from Rochester or neck neck tag country Rochester that ROC boy shout out to my boy Baggins due to passed away a couple years ago we OD'd over there by the pizza hut by the days in and you know he was hopped up I think he you know was on them ludes and on that garbage plate bra he got a caught a thick garbage plating couldn't couldn't get it down bra gang bra onward I just want to leave a comment on the podcast you had with Chris Lilly when you were talking about you had a dream about him I just wanted to mention that I actually I also had a dream about you the night before oh okay this is wild man because I've never been down this territory where I'm talking to a man that had a dream about me and so I'm curious to see how how this will go let's hear more brother thank you for calling and we were I was in the comedy club and is very crowded I was trying to make my way out of the club and you were trying to make your way through the club trying to go through the crowd there there was a little break in the people and so we met up damn this shit is getting erotic huh or maybe not maybe it's just two guys passing in the club about to find out in my dream and when I try to pass by you you gave me a look kind of a little bit of an attitude a little huff and puff okay then this sounds like me at the beginning of my comedy tour behind the scenes man I was huffle puffing man I was getting slithering and then I started to kind of really griffin door out towards the end onward now when I went by you as if like I was in your way and I know it was just a dream but I do still feel like maybe you owe me an apology and so I just wanted to put that out there listen I understand where you're coming from if you don't apologize but I just felt like you know maybe that was the right thing to do at this point gang gang huh you know with apology for the subconscious behavior you know what man I will apologize it's uh I don't need to be right man I'm sorry you know I'm sorry man I think I would that that you know I have had some of that behavior recently I think I've been in a lot of fear about just things changing in my life and just not knowing how to act and you know just worried about well how people are gonna think of me and worried if I'm deserving of different opportunities and just worried like if the world is like tricking me you know worried if the world is like just tricking me and saying oh well here's something you're gonna be able to get to do but then we're just tricking you you're gonna wake up or you're gonna some harsh reality is gonna show up and change things and I know some stuff we don't have control over but I could see myself probably if I was in my subconscious walking past somebody and giving them kind of a little bit of her you know a harumph so I'm sorry about that you know I'm sorry about that dude I could have you know I could have made the choice to be seeing you and just giving you a smile or giving you a thumbs up or you know no thumbs up which is also a new thing a lot of people are doing two hands out closed fist thumb tucked away inside the hand no thumbs up people like what in the what in the hell is going on but it's cool looking all right guy no thumbs up and that's like a Japanese thing it's like a new it's like the peace sign but it's like newer than that so I'm sorry I did that man and next time we see each other yeah keep your chakras open because I'll make sure that you know give you a little bit of an elbow you know a fist bump or something hearty something lovable you know maybe just you know I'll do have a little baton I'll do a quick little B twirl a little baton twirl you know show you a little bit of flair or something put a little put a little pendant on you on your lapel maybe something you know something that says vote for Jerry or something you know and then another pendant that says who the fuck is Jerry so that way you kind of get the full deal we had some patreon questions we're gonna get to him next time in this jet lag is literally shutting my face down I don't know if I don't think there's anything else to share at the moment I just want to apologize to anybody I know there's sometimes where people will reach out and like I try to get people tickets and a lot of times I try to help and a lot of times tickets are sold out to shows be careful there's a lot of second and third party websites that will sell tickets at extraordinary prices those are not the regular ticket sites those are second and third party you got to look at the name it can be sometimes they'll make the name just like ticketmaster it'll be like lick it master and the tickets $200 for the show I don't sell tickets at those high prices so if you see something going on like that that's not a natural ticket and you want that natural choice you know you don't want that breach birth ticket you know you you think you're coming to see me and you go to see lie I love it and his mother and they doing knitting or something or doing you know yuggling oh yeah man my brain is a little bit fried from the trip but I'm happy to be home I'm in a new studio I have no clue what's gonna happen you know but I'm this is the risk that I'm willing to take right now you know because I've learned some from a previous experience when we took the first risk of what you know it was good and maybe we're overstepping our bounds and getting more space I don't know so I'm curious to see you know how we'll fill this space and if we'll fill it and with what you know but I feel like it's some new opportunity and I feel like I've been feeling a lot of like inspiration recently to do some cool like giving back and outreach type of stuff and I don't I don't know what that's gonna be but I can really feel it starting to gestate inside of me but thank you guys for your patience thank you guys for being here today thanks for the calls as always the hotline 985-664-9503 we have some great patreon questions from Matthew Puccinelli Marisa Bruno Olivia Abert Seara Smith Mike Nucci and Quinn Hassan and I'll get to some of those next week but you guys be good to yourselves man on the way out let's go out with some Jameson flood every night it was

yourself.\"},{\"currTime\":131,\"text\":\"Teach you a little bit of something.\"},{\"currTime\":133,\"text\":\"Teach you how your skin feels a little bit.\"},{\"currTime\":135,\"text\":\"You know what I'm talking about?\"},{\"currTime\":136,\"text\":\"Teach you what's going on inside of your body, deep in there.\"},{\"currTime\":140,\"text\":\"And that's what I'm talking about today.\"},{\"currTime\":142,\"text\":\"A lot of times if you think about your stomach, what the fuck is going on with it?\"},{\"currTime\":149,\"text\":\"So here today we have a beautiful man and he's the author of the book, Grain Brain.\"},{\"currTime\":154,\"text\":\"Now he's a scientific kind of guy so, you know, he ain't gonna juggle for us, bro.\"},{\"currTime\":159,\"text\":\"But he'll definitely, he has more knowledge than I do.\"},{\"currTime\":163,\"text\":\"And so that's why I'm excited that he is here today.\"},{\"currTime\":166,\"text\":\"He's the author of Grain Brain, which has more than one million copies in print.\"},{\"currTime\":171,\"text\":\"Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Pearl Mudder.\"},{\"currTime\":188,\"text\":\"So what is gluten, Dr. Pearl Mudder?\"},{\"currTime\":192,\"text\":\"What is it?\"},{\"currTime\":193,\"text\":\"So gluten is a protein.\"},{\"currTime\":194,\"text\":\"It's found in wheat, barley and rye.\"},{\"currTime\":196,\"text\":\"Okay.\"},{\"currTime\":197,\"text\":\"And it's the rage right now.\"},{\"currTime\":199,\"text\":\"Gosh, we wrote about it five years ago in Grain Brain and at that point that was pretty darn disruptive.\"},{\"currTime\":204,\"text\":\"I want to tell you that people suddenly, you know, you threaten, give us our day,\"},{\"currTime\":208,\"text\":\"give us this day our daily bread and people have a conniption.\"},{\"currTime\":211,\"text\":\"People trip out.\"},{\"currTime\":212,\"text\":\"All my Jewish buddies first started tripping.\"},{\"currTime\":214,\"text\":\"They were like the first friends that I had.\"},{\"currTime\":216,\"text\":\"They make gluten-free matzah.\"},{\"currTime\":217,\"text\":\"Well, they started losing, like they were like losing it.\"},{\"currTime\":220,\"text\":\"And so then I was like, what's going on here?\"},{\"currTime\":222,\"text\":\"You know, and I mean, I've read more about it in your book,\"},{\"currTime\":226,\"text\":\"but I just wanted to hear like for a layman's like, you know,\"},{\"currTime\":230,\"text\":\"like if I saw gluten somewhere, would I know it's gluten?\"},{\"currTime\":233,\"text\":\"No, that's the thing.\"},{\"currTime\":235,\"text\":\"It's hidden in foods.\"},{\"currTime\":236,\"text\":\"You know, you find it in condiments and ketchup.\"},{\"currTime\":238,\"text\":\"You find it all over the place.\"},{\"currTime\":240,\"text\":\"It's tricky.\"},{\"currTime\":241,\"text\":\"It's like almost like a, who's that serial killer that they just had that documentary come out about?\"},{\"currTime\":245,\"text\":\"I don't know, but it's healthy.\"},{\"currTime\":246,\"text\":\"It's that Ted Bundy of the bread

Bundy.\"},{\"currTime\":255,\"text\":\"But having said that, it's, it's sinister.\"},{\"currTime\":258,\"text\":\"It lurks in the background.\"},{\"currTime\":260,\"text\":\"And, you know, when you face all of the chronic degenerative conditions that we face now in this world,\"},{\"currTime\":265,\"text\":\"the World Health Organization tells us that chronic degenerative conditions are the number one cause of death on planet Earth.\"},{\"currTime\":272,\"text\":\"We have to ask ourselves, what's the mechanism there?\"},{\"currTime\":275,\"text\":\"And the mechanism is inflammation.\"},{\"currTime\":277,\"text\":\"Okay.\"},{\"currTime\":278,\"text\":\"What's causing inflammation?\"},{\"currTime\":279,\"text\":\"High sugar diet, not enough fat, things like gluten, food allergies.\"},{\"currTime\":284,\"text\":\"Those things literally have to come off the table.\"},{\"currTime\":287,\"text\":\"Now I was reading in your book that, and this is, this blew me away that people who have diabetes are twice as likely to have Alzheimer's.\"},{\"currTime\":297,\"text\":\"Let's contextualize that.\"},{\"currTime\":299,\"text\":\"Okay.\"},{\"currTime\":300,\"text\":\"We live in a country where 5.4 million of us have already been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.\"},{\"currTime\":306,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":307,\"text\":\"Number one, number two, there's no treatment, none whatsoever.\"},{\"currTime\":311,\"text\":\"And matter of fact, in November of 18, a study came out in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association,\"},{\"currTime\":316,\"text\":\"showing that the drugs that doctors are using to treat Alzheimer's are actually making them worse.\"},{\"currTime\":323,\"text\":\"Wow.\"},{\"currTime\":324,\"text\":\"As opposed to neutral.\"},{\"currTime\":325,\"text\":\"They're actually declining more quickly.\"},{\"currTime\":327,\"text\":\"So how is that even a thing?\"},{\"currTime\":328,\"text\":\"Anybody could make up that drug.\"},{\"currTime\":330,\"text\":\"I'm telling you, I would say what you just said, that's the whole show.\"},{\"currTime\":334,\"text\":\"How is that a thing?\"},{\"currTime\":336,\"text\":\"Think about it.\"},{\"currTime\":337,\"text\":\"I mean, yet, you know, it's proved by the FDA, it's useless, and in fact, making people worse,\"},{\"currTime\":342,\"text\":\"and people are spending a billion dollars in America to buy these drugs,\"},{\"currTime\":347,\"text\":\"putting their faith into these drugs to help mom or dad or husband or wife.\"},{\"currTime\":351,\"text\":\"And I've been there.\"},{\"currTime\":352,\"text\":\"I've been there with my dad who died of Alzheimer's.\"},{\"currTime\":354,\"text\":\"Yeah, I read that in your book.\"},{\"currTime\":355,\"text\":\"You know what it's like.\"},{\"currTime\":356,\"text\":\"Yeah, my stepfather has it, and my mother has to.\"},{\"currTime\":358,\"text\":\"And it's horrible.\"},{\"currTime\":359,\"text\":\"And it's mostly preventable.\"},{\"currTime\":361,\"text\":\"Right.\"},{\"currTime\":362,\"text\":\"And that's what we shout about.\"},{\"currTime\":364,\"text\":\"What you said is that diabetes is related.\"},{\"currTime\":367,\"text\":\"Okay.\"},{\"currTime\":368,\"text\":\"You know, when 80 million Americans are diabetic or pre-diabetic,\"},{\"currTime\":373,\"text\":\"it's not a genetic issue.\"},{\"currTime\":375,\"text\":\"All of a sudden, that just happened the past 50 years.\"},{\"currTime\":377,\"text\":\"It's because we've changed our diet.\"},{\"currTime\":380,\"text\":\"Now we're eating more sugar, and this is a disease of sugar,\"},{\"currTime\":383,\"text\":\"and refined carbohydrates and less fat,\"},{\"currTime\":385,\"text\":\"and all of a sudden, everybody becomes diabetic\"},{\"currTime\":387,\"text\":\"that may increase your risk for an untreatable illness, Alzheimer's,\"},{\"currTime\":391,\"text\":\"two to fourfold.\"},{\"currTime\":393,\"text\":\"Wow.\"},{\"currTime\":394,\"text\":\"Then you're really screwed.\"},{\"currTime\":396,\"text\":\"So that's really, so if you have that in your family,\"},{\"currTime\":399,\"text\":\"I mean, these are really things you need to look out for,\"},{\"currTime\":401,\"text\":\"because Alzheimer's can take,\"},{\"currTime\":403,\"text\":\"when does it usually kind of strike people Alzheimer's?\"},{\"currTime\":406,\"text\":\"The beginning stages of Alzheimer's,\"},{\"currTime\":408,\"text\":\"what sets the stage for when you can't figure out\"},{\"currTime\":411,\"text\":\"what's going on around you, happens in your 20s and 30s.\"},{\"currTime\":415,\"text\":\"Jesus.\"},{\"currTime\":416,\"text\":\"That's your audience, and that's a very important concept.\"},{\"currTime\":419,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":420,\"text\":\"But when you're my age, and you suddenly can't remember\"},{\"currTime\":423,\"text\":\"the grandchildren's names, and you name it.\"},{\"currTime\":425,\"text\":\"Because that's what we think it is.\"},{\"currTime\":427,\"text\":\"You bet.\"},{\"currTime\":428,\"text\":\"By then, you're already down the road.\"},{\"currTime\":429,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":430,\"text\":\"We, you know, a lot of literature shows that\"},{\"currTime\":432,\"text\":\"if you look at markers of inflammation in the blood,\"},{\"currTime\":435,\"text\":\"they predict Alzheimer's 30 years ahead of time.\"},{\"currTime\":439,\"text\":\"Wow.\"},{\"currTime\":440,\"text\":\"And how do you get inflammation markers in the blood?\"},{\"currTime\":442,\"text\":\"You eat the wrong diet.\"},{\"currTime\":443,\"text\":\"So it's not like, you know, people say,\"},{\"currTime\":446,\"text\":\"oh, I had a heart attack.\"},{\"currTime\":447,\"text\":\"Well, it's not like you're walking on the street,\"},{\"currTime\":449,\"text\":\"and then all of a sudden this thing attacks you out of the blue.\"},{\"currTime\":451,\"text\":\"That's lightning.\"},{\"currTime\":452,\"text\":\"Yeah, that's it.\"},{\"currTime\":453,\"text\":\"That's lightning, right.\"},{\"currTime\":454,\"text\":\"Heart attack happens because you ate the wrong food,\"},{\"currTime\":456,\"text\":\"you didn't exercise, you have some genetic issues, et cetera.\"},{\"currTime\":459,\"text\":\"You set the stage for heart attack,\"},{\"currTime\":461,\"text\":\"you set the stage for Alzheimer's,\"},{\"currTime\":463,\"text\":\"and I'm here to tell your audience that there are changes\"},{\"currTime\":466,\"text\":\"to make today to lower your risk.\"},{\"currTime\":469,\"text\":\"Because when you get there, when you get to a place\"},{\"currTime\":471,\"text\":\"where the doctor finally says, you've got this,\"},{\"currTime\":474,\"text\":\"there's nothing you can do.\"},{\"currTime\":476,\"text\":\"So yeah, so it's one of the things you have to start early.\"},{\"currTime\":478,\"text\":\"Yep.\"},{\"currTime\":479,\"text\":\"And I said 20s and 30s.\"},{\"currTime\":481,\"text\":\"Well, when do you start setting the stage for diabetes?\"},{\"currTime\":484,\"text\":\"Adolescence, childhood, you said it when you're born.\"},{\"currTime\":489,\"text\":\"Actually, the changes begin before you're even born,\"},{\"currTime\":492,\"text\":\"when you're in utero, depending on mother's lifestyle choices,\"},{\"currTime\":495,\"text\":\"has a huge role to play on whether you're going to be diabetic,\"},{\"currTime\":498,\"text\":\"whether you're going to be overweight,\"},{\"currTime\":500,\"text\":\"which is a risk factor as well.\"},{\"currTime\":502,\"text\":\"Wow.\"},{\"currTime\":503,\"text\":\"So I'm just thinking to myself, like, you know,\"},{\"currTime\":508,\"text\":\"if I'm just hearing this, you know, like a lot,\"},{\"currTime\":510,\"text\":\"because a lot of our listeners are 20 and they're 20s and 30s.\"},{\"currTime\":513,\"text\":\"And, you know, some of them may be diabetic, may not,\"},{\"currTime\":516,\"text\":\"but they're usually a lot of good people,\"},{\"currTime\":518,\"text\":\"a lot of active people that want to make their lives better.\"},{\"currTime\":520,\"text\":\"Overall, that seems to be our audience.\"},{\"currTime\":522,\"text\":\"So what are like some easy ways out of the gate that you think,\"},{\"currTime\":526,\"text\":\"you know, is it just a rich thing?\"},{\"currTime\":529,\"text\":\"Sometimes I feel like just the rich can be able to,\"},{\"currTime\":531,\"text\":\"you know, really have a nice thing.\"},{\"currTime\":532,\"text\":\"It's just the rich, because you have to buy something.\"},{\"currTime\":535,\"text\":\"Right.\"},{\"currTime\":536,\"text\":\"You got to go out and buy a new pair of sneakers.\"},{\"currTime\":538,\"text\":\"Really?\"},{\"currTime\":539,\"text\":\"Now, I don't know how rich you have to be,\"},{\"currTime\":540,\"text\":\"or you get them out of a bin, whatever you need to do,\"},{\"currTime\":542,\"text\":\"or you go barefoot.\"},{\"currTime\":544,\"text\":\"The bottom line is, step one is you got to exercise.\"},{\"currTime\":546,\"text\":\"You got to get moving.\"},{\"currTime\":548,\"text\":\"You got to get your butt off the couch,\"},{\"currTime\":550,\"text\":\"and you've got to get at least 20 to 30 minutes a day\"},{\"currTime\":553,\"text\":\"of aerobics, add some resistance exercise to that,\"},{\"currTime\":556,\"text\":\"fine, but you got to get your heart rate up.\"},{\"currTime\":558,\"text\":\"And to what number?\"},{\"currTime\":560,\"text\":\"I don't know.\"},{\"currTime\":561,\"text\":\"I usually tell people 180 minus your age.\"},{\"currTime\":564,\"text\":\"Do the math.\"},{\"currTime\":565,\"text\":\"Right.\"},{\"currTime\":566,\"text\":\"If you can't do the math, then you really need to exercise.\"},{\"currTime\":568,\"text\":\"You got more accrued.\"},{\"currTime\":569,\"text\":\"You bet you do.\"},{\"currTime\":570,\"text\":\"And why do you want to exercise?\"},{\"currTime\":571,\"text\":\"Well, the relationship between exercise,\"},{\"currTime\":573,\"text\":\"if you look at the epidemiology of it,\"},{\"currTime\":575,\"text\":\"shows those people who have higher rates of exercise\"},{\"currTime\":577,\"text\":\"have lower rates of Alzheimer's.\"},{\"currTime\":579,\"text\":\"But beyond that, exercise changes gene expression\"},{\"currTime\":583,\"text\":\"and codes for the body to produce a chemical\"},{\"currTime\":586,\"text\":\"called BDNF that tells your brain to grow new brain cells.\"},{\"currTime\":590,\"text\":\"Who knew?\"},{\"currTime\":591,\"text\":\"You know, when I was, I hate to say when I was your age,\"},{\"currTime\":594,\"text\":\"but when I was your age, we were told that we were\"},{\"currTime\":597,\"text\":\"given a certain number of brain cells,\"},{\"currTime\":599,\"text\":\"and then as we, every beer we drank, we lost 30,000.\"},{\"currTime\":602,\"text\":\"Whatever it was, you'd lose X number of brain cells.\"},{\"currTime\":604,\"text\":\"Coke.\"},{\"currTime\":605,\"text\":\"Because we didn't know that you grow new brain cells.\"},{\"currTime\":608,\"text\":\"And how do you grow new brain cells?\"},{\"currTime\":610,\"text\":\"By exercising, by taking a fish oil supplement,\"},{\"currTime\":613,\"text\":\"by using turmeric in your cooking.\"},{\"currTime\":616,\"text\":\"This turns on the gene pathway.\"},{\"currTime\":618,\"text\":\"You can change your gene expression,\"},{\"currTime\":620,\"text\":\"grow new brain cells and stave off Alzheimer's.\"},{\"currTime\":623,\"text\":\"What's so hard about what I'm saying here?\"},{\"currTime\":626,\"text\":\"Right.\"},{\"currTime\":627,\"text\":\"It's really basic.\"},{\"currTime\":628,\"text\":\"And so do you think there's like a psychology to,\"},{\"currTime\":632,\"text\":\"like sometimes whenever you get into a path in life,\"},{\"currTime\":637,\"text\":\"whether it's an eating pattern or a,\"},{\"currTime\":639,\"text\":\"and you know it's detrimental,\"},{\"currTime\":641,\"text\":\"you know that the end is doesn't end well.\"},{\"currTime\":644,\"text\":\"Is there some term for a psychology\"},{\"currTime\":646,\"text\":\"to stay in that path almost out of spite\"},{\"currTime\":649,\"text\":\"or something, you know?\"},{\"currTime\":650,\"text\":\"There are a lot of terms.\"},{\"currTime\":651,\"text\":\"One is mindset.\"},{\"currTime\":652,\"text\":\"Okay.\"},{\"currTime\":653,\"text\":\"That your mind is set.\"},{\"currTime\":654,\"text\":\"In fact, I had, oddly enough at the interview this morning,\"},{\"currTime\":657,\"text\":\"and the question was,\"},{\"currTime\":658,\"text\":\"how does mindset come into play for health decisions?\"},{\"currTime\":661,\"text\":\"Your mind isn't set.\"},{\"currTime\":662,\"text\":\"You can change your mind,\"},{\"currTime\":663,\"text\":\"and the more you change your mind and then do the right thing,\"},{\"currTime\":666,\"text\":\"the better that pathway becomes,\"},{\"currTime\":668,\"text\":\"the more reinforcing it will be.\"},{\"currTime\":670,\"text\":\"The other thing I talk about is inconvenient truth.\"},{\"currTime\":674,\"text\":\"You know, Al Gore talked about the inconvenient truth,\"},{\"currTime\":676,\"text\":\"the climate change.\"},{\"currTime\":677,\"text\":\"I did a CBS this morning program a couple of months ago,\"},{\"currTime\":681,\"text\":\"and they said,\"},{\"currTime\":682,\"text\":\"no, Dr. Perlman has a new book.\"},{\"currTime\":683,\"text\":\"There's a new book talking about gluten and carbs\"},{\"currTime\":685,\"text\":\"and all that,\"},{\"currTime\":686,\"text\":\"but we reached out to the sugar industry\"},{\"currTime\":689,\"text\":\"and they told us we should eat more sugar\"},{\"currTime\":691,\"text\":\"because decades of research.\"},{\"currTime\":693,\"text\":\"And in my mind, it was hashtag,\"},{\"currTime\":696,\"text\":\"why that's fantastic, hashtag WTF, right?\"},{\"currTime\":700,\"text\":\"Isn't that what it's named for?\"},{\"currTime\":701,\"text\":\"Why that's fantastic.\"},{\"currTime\":702,\"text\":\"Yeah, okay, good.\"},{\"currTime\":703,\"text\":\"So in my mind,\"},{\"currTime\":704,\"text\":\"and then the lady gets on, she says,\"},{\"currTime\":705,\"text\":\"and then this morning I had,\"},{\"currTime\":706,\"text\":\"well, last night I had truffles\"},{\"currTime\":708,\"text\":\"because they're in season,\"},{\"currTime\":709,\"text\":\"truffle pasta with a jelly-filled donut or something.\"},{\"currTime\":713,\"text\":\"Jesus.\"},{\"currTime\":714,\"text\":\"And again, it's an inconvenient truth.\"},{\"currTime\":715,\"text\":\"What I'm saying to your audience today\"},{\"currTime\":717,\"text\":\"is an inconvenient truth.\"},{\"currTime\":718,\"text\":\"Why?\"},{\"currTime\":719,\"text\":\"Because we all have a sweet tooth.\"},{\"currTime\":720,\"text\":\"Oh, yes.\"},{\"currTime\":721,\"text\":\"We all would love to eat sweet and pasta.\"},{\"currTime\":722,\"text\":\"Oh, Don.\"},{\"currTime\":723,\"text\":\"Of course.\"},{\"currTime\":724,\"text\":\"It's comfort food\"},{\"currTime\":725,\"text\":\"because it stimulates the part of the brain\"},{\"currTime\":726,\"text\":\"for instant reward, dopamine surge,\"},{\"currTime\":729,\"text\":\"and your momentarily content.\"},{\"currTime\":732,\"text\":\"But oddly enough,\"},{\"currTime\":734,\"text\":\"that diet distances you\"},{\"currTime\":736,\"text\":\"from the executive center of the brain\"},{\"currTime\":738,\"text\":\"that lets you make better decisions,\"},{\"currTime\":740,\"text\":\"plan for the future,\"},{\"currTime\":742,\"text\":\"be more compassionate and empathetic\"},{\"currTime\":744,\"text\":\"for yourself, for the next person,\"},{\"currTime\":746,\"text\":\"and for the planet.\"},{\"currTime\":747,\"text\":\"Wow.\"},{\"currTime\":748,\"text\":\"So the more we distance ourselves from impulsivity,\"},{\"currTime\":750,\"text\":\"the better decisions we'll make,\"},{\"currTime\":752,\"text\":\"we'll get on an exercise regimen,\"},{\"currTime\":754,\"text\":\"we'll stay on it,\"},{\"currTime\":755,\"text\":\"and we'll choose to eat better foods\"},{\"currTime\":757,\"text\":\"that will enhance that.\"},{\"currTime\":758,\"text\":\"It's feed-forward.\"},{\"currTime\":759,\"text\":\"That's really interesting\"},{\"currTime\":760,\"text\":\"because impulse is that,\"},{\"currTime\":762,\"text\":\"it's almost just like that dirty magnet\"},{\"currTime\":765,\"text\":\"that's in us,\"},{\"currTime\":766,\"text\":\"and it just wants whatever the easiest,\"},{\"currTime\":769,\"text\":\"quickest hit is.\"},{\"currTime\":770,\"text\":\"Done.\"},{\"currTime\":771,\"text\":\"And then you need more of it.\"},{\"currTime\":772,\"text\":\"Ah, I see.\"},{\"currTime\":773,\"text\":\"You need more of it\"},{\"currTime\":774,\"text\":\"because it's a dopamine surge,\"},{\"currTime\":775,\"text\":\"stimulates the opiate receptors in your brain.\"},{\"currTime\":777,\"text\":\"Done.\"},{\"currTime\":778,\"text\":\"You've done your thing,\"},{\"currTime\":780,\"text\":\"and now you need more.\"},{\"currTime\":781,\"text\":\"And the more you do it,\"},{\"currTime\":783,\"text\":\"the more that receptor needs to be stimulated.\"},{\"currTime\":785,\"text\":\"And so choice is almost behind impulse a little bit.\"},{\"currTime\":788,\"text\":\"I mean, it's right there with it,\"},{\"currTime\":789,\"text\":\"but it's almost a gift to out-ride the impulse,\"},{\"currTime\":792,\"text\":\"I feel like.\"},{\"currTime\":793,\"text\":\"Exactly right.\"},{\"currTime\":794,\"text\":\"And for a second,\"},{\"currTime\":795,\"text\":\"and then be able to,\"},{\"currTime\":796,\"text\":\"that's what I feel for me.\"},{\"currTime\":797,\"text\":\"It's like, okay, I just need a second\"},{\"currTime\":799,\"text\":\"and make a choice.\"},{\"currTime\":800,\"text\":\"The moment you just did that,\"},{\"currTime\":801,\"text\":\"what you just did, Theo,\"},{\"currTime\":803,\"text\":\"is you stopped dealing\"},{\"currTime\":805,\"text\":\"and responding to your amygdala brain,\"},{\"currTime\":807,\"text\":\"your reptilian brain,\"},{\"currTime\":808,\"text\":\"that said,\"},{\"currTime\":809,\"text\":\"I'm gonna eat this,\"},{\"currTime\":810,\"text\":\"I'm gonna do this,\"},{\"currTime\":811,\"text\":\"I'm gonna punch this guy.\"},{\"currTime\":812,\"text\":\"And instead,\"},{\"currTime\":813,\"text\":\"I'm gonna decide\"},{\"currTime\":815,\"text\":\"that one moment\"},{\"currTime\":816,\"text\":\"is all the difference in the world.\"},{\"currTime\":817,\"text\":\"I'm gonna think about,\"},{\"currTime\":818,\"text\":\"do I really wanna eat this?\"},{\"currTime\":820,\"text\":\"Do I really want to,\"},{\"currTime\":821,\"text\":\"whatever the addiction may be,\"},{\"currTime\":823,\"text\":\"do I really wanna do this\"},{\"currTime\":824,\"text\":\"and now make a more sophisticated,\"},{\"currTime\":826,\"text\":\"more human rational decision\"},{\"currTime\":828,\"text\":\"to not do it.\"},{\"currTime\":830,\"text\":\"You've broken the spell,\"},{\"currTime\":831,\"text\":\"you can move forward.\"},{\"currTime\":832,\"text\":\"Wow.\"},{\"currTime\":833,\"text\":\"And does that get easier over time doing that?\"},{\"currTime\":835,\"text\":\"Absolutely.\"},{\"currTime\":836,\"text\":\"We talked about the growth of new brain cells.\"},{\"currTime\":838,\"text\":\"The same

should\"},{\"currTime\":2562,\"text\":\"get out and experience blue light, really have exposure to bright sunlight, because that\"},{\"currTime\":2567,\"text\":\"really will tamp down

how important that is for you, for reducing cortisol surges,\"},{\"currTime\":2591,\"text\":\"for reducing inflammation.\"},{\"currTime\":2593,\"text\":\"So getting what we call salubrious or

take?\"},{\"currTime\":2606,\"text\":\"I think they are.\"},{\"currTime\":2607,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":2608,\"text\":\"But I would say before we supplement, it would be good to do it more naturally.\"},{\"currTime\":2612,\"text\":\"Right.\"},{\"currTime\":2613,\"text\":\"And recognize what is it that allows melatonin to be present or absent.\"},{\"currTime\":2617,\"text\":\"And it's mostly blue light.\"},{\"currTime\":2618,\"text\":\"Light.\"},{\"currTime\":2619,\"text\":\"So that get a lot of blue light in the daytime.\"},{\"currTime\":2621,\"text\":\"Evening comes around, you

time.\"},{\"currTime\":2657,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":2658,\"text\":\"So you may not know that.\"},{\"currTime\":2659,\"text\":\"That's why you get a sleep

raise that.\"},{\"currTime\":2683,\"text\":\"The aura ring you put on your hand, you wear it all the time, measures your level of activity,\"},{\"currTime\":2687,\"text\":\"but is able to measure the

got\"},{\"currTime\":2694,\"text\":\"X number of hours in this stage of sleep and that stage of sleep.\"},{\"currTime\":2698,\"text\":\"And then, you know, you work with

that.\"},{\"currTime\":3663,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":3664,\"text\":\"All right.\"},{\"currTime\":3665,\"text\":\"So case in point.\"},{\"currTime\":3666,\"text\":\"So when you inhibit stomach acid, you compromise B12 absorption, your B12 level goes down.\"},{\"currTime\":3670,\"text\":\"So his doctor is giving him, recommending B12 orally, I'm not his doctor.\"},{\"currTime\":3676,\"text\":\"But if a person had that low a B12 level, I don't know if how low it was.\"},{\"currTime\":3681,\"text\":\"We would definitely start with some injections.\"},{\"currTime\":3683,\"text\":\"So that's something you could also possibly do is whenever you go back to your doctor,\"},{\"currTime\":3687,\"text\":\"talk about also injections, make

probiotic\"},{\"currTime\":5411,\"text\":\"part, probably.\"},{\"currTime\":5412,\"text\":\"Right.\"},{\"currTime\":5413,\"text\":\"You think there's some probiotics in there?\"},{\"currTime\":5414,\"text\":\"They have to put something.\"},{\"currTime\":5415,\"text\":\"Who knows?\"},{\"currTime\":5416,\"text\":\"Your Lottie doll.\"},{\"currTime\":5417,\"text\":\"There's no oversight as far as that goes.\"},{\"currTime\":5421,\"text\":\"Who looks at that and says, yeah, not only are they in there, generally, read the label.\"},{\"currTime\":5426,\"text\":\"And often that's what they're going to say is 10 billion CFU, meaning colony forming\"},{\"currTime\":5432,\"text\":\"units at the time of

you.\"},{\"currTime\":5437,\"text\":\"Right.\"},{\"currTime\":5438,\"text\":\"You don't want something that when they manufactured it 18 months ago had this, now it's got nothing.\"},{\"currTime\":5443,\"text\":\"And what that fresh hitter?\"},{\"currTime\":5444,\"text\":\"You want to have something that says 30 billion CFUs guaranteed for 12 months after the date\"},{\"currTime\":5451,\"text\":\"that is stamped on that product when it was manufactured.\"},{\"currTime\":5453,\"text\":\"So you take it six months later, it's been on the store shelf you had at home.\"},{\"currTime\":5457,\"text\":\"And now it's still going to kick your butt in terms of having good probiotics.\"},{\"currTime\":5462,\"text\":\"And so eating better will leave me more to be

those that are in my stomach?\"},{\"currTime\":5483,\"text\":\"So instincts are some things that are programmed.\"},{\"currTime\":5486,\"text\":\"Sweet is an instinct.\"},{\"currTime\":5488,\"text\":\"Sex is an instinct.\"},{\"currTime\":5489,\"text\":\"Okay.\"},{\"currTime\":5490,\"text\":\"Feast, flight against potentially threatening issue is an instinct.\"},{\"currTime\":5498,\"text\":\"So we talk about.\"},{\"currTime\":5500,\"text\":\"Trust your instincts, people say.\"},{\"currTime\":5502,\"text\":\"Well, trust your instincts to some degree, but sometimes our instincts can get us into\"},{\"currTime\":5506,\"text\":\"trouble.\"},{\"currTime\":5509,\"text\":\"Everybody says something to you and you punch them in the face.\"},{\"currTime\":5512,\"text\":\"Instinctually, well, they may have been talking to the guy standing behind you, right?\"},{\"currTime\":5515,\"text\":\"Or they may have thought you were something, whatever.\"},{\"currTime\":5518,\"text\":\"And so that's an instinctual response, an amygdala based sudden reaction that we need\"},{\"currTime\":5521,\"text\":\"to temper.\"},{\"currTime\":5524,\"text\":\"I think back, I mean, I'll never forget standing in line of all places at Best Buy.\"},{\"currTime\":5529,\"text\":\"Oh yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":5530,\"text\":\"No, it was Costco, it was Costco.\"},{\"currTime\":5533,\"text\":\"And I had an instinctual response that I regret.\"},{\"currTime\":5537,\"text\":\"And you could say what you want to me, I'm okay with that.\"},{\"currTime\":5541,\"text\":\"But somebody said something to my wife and it didn't, luckily it could have been worse.\"},{\"currTime\":5548,\"text\":\"And I have to say, I was very down on myself for not reining that in.\"},{\"currTime\":5553,\"text\":\"I should have been the bigger person and reined it in and I didn't.\"},{\"currTime\":5559,\"text\":\"But it's a lesson.\"},{\"currTime\":5561,\"text\":\"So sometimes those instinctual responses can harm you.\"},{\"currTime\":5564,\"text\":\"And instinctually, we should eat sugar all the time, because instinctually, we are told\"},{\"currTime\":5570,\"text\":\"that it is good for us, it's telling us winter's coming and that the fruit is safe

that.\"},{\"currTime\":5599,\"text\":\"So something happened in line and you got an altercation.\"},{\"currTime\":5601,\"text\":\"Yeah, it could have been a lot worse.\"},{\"currTime\":5603,\"text\":\"And anyway.\"},{\"currTime\":5604,\"text\":\"But that was your instincts.\"},{\"currTime\":5606,\"text\":\"It was my instinct.\"},{\"currTime\":5607,\"text\":\"But I checked it right at the right moment.\"},{\"currTime\":5610,\"text\":\"And I actually think a sensei, a teacher from years ago, martial arts teacher, who worked\"},{\"currTime\":5618,\"text\":\"with me with that, that got me to the level and would, would kind of actually would hit\"},{\"currTime\":5623,\"text\":\"me in the face until I, and would,

training me not to respond.\"},{\"currTime\":5634,\"text\":\"And I got to that point and that engram was activated.\"},{\"currTime\":5638,\"text\":\"And then I backed down.\"},{\"currTime\":5639,\"text\":\"And I was very grateful for that training because it took me the edge.\"},{\"currTime\":5644,\"text\":\"You know, it's funny because I had an experience.\"},{\"currTime\":5646,\"text\":\"I was in, I think Berlin one time with a girlfriend, we were traveling and, and we're\"},{\"currTime\":5651,\"text\":\"on this bike tour.\"},{\"currTime\":5652,\"text\":\"You know, you go on bike tours when you're on a tour sometimes.\"},{\"currTime\":5654,\"text\":\"And some guy was like going down a bike path really fast and he like hit my girlfriend's\"},{\"currTime\":5659,\"text\":\"bike like really hard.\"},{\"currTime\":5661,\"text\":\"And when I looked at him, I could tell immediately he'd like done it on purpose.\"},{\"currTime\":5664,\"text\":\"We weren't really in the way.\"},{\"currTime\":5666,\"text\":\"He had, maybe he got angry with tourists.\"},{\"currTime\":5668,\"text\":\"He didn't like living in the city.\"},{\"currTime\":5669,\"text\":\"Who knows?\"},{\"currTime\":5671,\"text\":\"But my first instinct was to pedal off and fucking kill that guy, you know, get a knife\"},{\"currTime\":5678,\"text\":\"out of an imaginary knife suddenly in my hand.\"},{\"currTime\":5680,\"text\":\"Like I was going to fucking kill this dude, you know, but I didn't, right?\"},{\"currTime\":5685,\"text\":\"I didn't do that.\"},{\"currTime\":5686,\"text\":\"I just stayed there.\"},{\"currTime\":5687,\"text\":\"You know, I made sure she was okay.\"},{\"currTime\":5689,\"text\":\"But I've always regretted not, maybe not killing him, but at least driving over and\"},{\"currTime\":5694,\"text\":\"jumping and just, you know, tackling him and at least.\"},{\"currTime\":5696,\"text\":\"But think about it now from the perspective of the fact that you were able to reign yourself\"},{\"currTime\":5702,\"text\":\"in.\"},{\"currTime\":5704,\"text\":\"That is absolutely huge.\"},{\"currTime\":5706,\"text\":\"Still makes me mad though.\"},{\"currTime\":5707,\"text\":\"Think about it.\"},{\"currTime\":5708,\"text\":\"That you could reign yourself in at that moment and not do, and you could reign in the amygdala\"},{\"currTime\":5712,\"text\":\"and say, I'm not going to do it.\"},{\"currTime\":5714,\"text\":\"And that should be a sense of pride that you have.\"},{\"currTime\":5717,\"text\":\"But I felt like it was a wimp.\"},{\"currTime\":5718,\"text\":\"I felt like a wimp though.\"},{\"currTime\":5719,\"text\":\"No, you're not a wimp.\"},{\"currTime\":5720,\"text\":\"You know

go.\"},{\"currTime\":5732,\"text\":\"I guess I still have a resentment against that man.\"},{\"currTime\":5733,\"text\":\"So I'm glad I'm thinking this out.\"},{\"currTime\":5734,\"text\":\"It's good to feel it though.\"},{\"currTime\":5735,\"text\":\"It's good to take yourself out of the moment and experience it.\"},{\"currTime\":5738,\"text\":\"That was what that Deep Breath was just about,

it.\"},{\"currTime\":5753,\"text\":\"Take that purging breath, clearing breath, and move on.\"},{\"currTime\":5756,\"text\":\"You're a better person for that.\"},{\"currTime\":5757,\"text\":\"And the

Teach you a little bit of something. Teach you how your skin feels a little bit. You know what I'm talking about? Teach you what's going on inside of your body, deep in there. And that's what I'm talking about today. A lot of times if you think about your stomach, what the fuck is going on with it? So here today we have a beautiful man and he's the author of the book, Grain Brain. Now he's a scientific kind of guy so, you know, he ain't gonna juggle for us, bro. But he'll definitely, he has more knowledge than I do. And so that's why I'm excited that he is here today. He's the author of Grain Brain, which has more than one million copies in print. Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Pearl Mudder. So what is gluten, Dr. Pearl Mudder? What is it? So gluten is a protein. It's found in wheat, barley and rye. Okay. And it's the rage right now. Gosh, we wrote about it five years ago in Grain Brain and at that point that was pretty darn disruptive. I want to tell you that people suddenly, you know, you threaten, give us our day, give us this day our daily bread and people have a conniption. People trip out. All my Jewish buddies first started tripping. They were like the first friends that I had. They make gluten-free matzah. Well, they started losing, like they were like losing it. And so then I was like, what's going on here? You know, and I mean, I've read more about it in your book, but I just wanted to hear like for a layman's like, you know, like if I saw gluten somewhere, would I know it's gluten? No, that's the thing. It's hidden in foods. You know, you find it in condiments and ketchup. You find it all over the place. It's tricky. It's like almost like a, who's that serial killer that they just had that documentary come out about? I don't know, but it's healthy. It's that Ted Bundy of the bread program. I'm going to have to let you own that one. I'm not going to go there, but that said, I wouldn't say it as aggressive as Ted Bundy. But having said that, it's, it's sinister. It lurks in the background. And, you know, when you face all of the chronic degenerative conditions that we face now in this world, the World Health Organization tells us that chronic degenerative conditions are the number one cause of death on planet Earth. We have to ask ourselves, what's the mechanism there? And the mechanism is inflammation. Okay. What's causing inflammation? High sugar diet, not enough fat, things like gluten, food allergies. Those things literally have to come off the table. Now I was reading in your book that, and this is, this blew me away that people who have diabetes are twice as likely to have Alzheimer's. Let's contextualize that. Okay. We live in a country where 5.4 million of us have already been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Yeah. Number one, number two, there's no treatment, none whatsoever. And matter of fact, in November of 18, a study came out in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association, showing that the drugs that doctors are using to treat Alzheimer's are actually making them worse. Wow. As opposed to neutral. They're actually declining more quickly. So how is that even a thing? Anybody could make up that drug. I'm telling you, I would say what you just said, that's the whole show. How is that a thing? Think about it. I mean, yet, you know, it's proved by the FDA, it's useless, and in fact, making people worse, and people are spending a billion dollars in America to buy these drugs, putting their faith into these drugs to help mom or dad or husband or wife. And I've been there. I've been there with my dad who died of Alzheimer's. Yeah, I read that in your book. You know what it's like. Yeah, my stepfather has it, and my mother has to. And it's horrible. And it's mostly preventable. Right. And that's what we shout about. What you said is that diabetes is related. Okay. You know, when 80 million Americans are diabetic or pre-diabetic, it's not a genetic issue. All of a sudden, that just happened the past 50 years. It's because we've changed our diet. Now we're eating more sugar, and this is a disease of sugar, and refined carbohydrates and less fat, and all of a sudden, everybody becomes diabetic that may increase your risk for an untreatable illness, Alzheimer's, two to fourfold. Wow. Then you're really screwed. So that's really, so if you have that in your family, I mean, these are really things you need to look out for, because Alzheimer's can take, when does it usually kind of strike people Alzheimer's? The beginning stages of Alzheimer's, what sets the stage for when you can't figure out what's going on around you, happens in your 20s and 30s. Jesus. That's your audience, and that's a very important concept. Yeah. But when you're my age, and you suddenly can't remember the grandchildren's names, and you name it. Because that's what we think it is. You bet. By then, you're already down the road. Yeah. We, you know, a lot of literature shows that if you look at markers of inflammation in the blood, they predict Alzheimer's 30 years ahead of time. Wow. And how do you get inflammation markers in the blood? You eat the wrong diet. So it's not like, you know, people say, oh, I had a heart attack. Well, it's not like you're walking on the street, and then all of a sudden this thing attacks you out of the blue. That's lightning. Yeah, that's it. That's lightning, right. Heart attack happens because you ate the wrong food, you didn't exercise, you have some genetic issues, et cetera. You set the stage for heart attack, you set the stage for Alzheimer's, and I'm here to tell your audience that there are changes to make today to lower your risk. Because when you get there, when you get to a place where the doctor finally says, you've got this, there's nothing you can do. So yeah, so it's one of the things you have to start early. Yep. And I said 20s and 30s. Well, when do you start setting the stage for diabetes? Adolescence, childhood, you said it when you're born. Actually, the changes begin before you're even born, when you're in utero, depending on mother's lifestyle choices, has a huge role to play on whether you're going to be diabetic, whether you're going to be overweight, which is a risk factor as well. Wow. So I'm just thinking to myself, like, you know, if I'm just hearing this, you know, like a lot, because a lot of our listeners are 20 and they're 20s and 30s. And, you know, some of them may be diabetic, may not, but they're usually a lot of good people, a lot of active people that want to make their lives better. Overall, that seems to be our audience. So what are like some easy ways out of the gate that you think, you know, is it just a rich thing? Sometimes I feel like just the rich can be able to, you know, really have a nice thing. It's just the rich, because you have to buy something. Right. You got to go out and buy a new pair of sneakers. Really? Now, I don't know how rich you have to be, or you get them out of a bin, whatever you need to do, or you go barefoot. The bottom line is, step one is you got to exercise. You got to get moving. You got to get your butt off the couch, and you've got to get at least 20 to 30 minutes a day of aerobics, add some resistance exercise to that, fine, but you got to get your heart rate up. And to what number? I don't know. I usually tell people 180 minus your age. Do the math. Right. If you can't do the math, then you really need to exercise. You got more accrued. You bet you do. And why do you want to exercise? Well, the relationship between exercise, if you look at the epidemiology of it, shows those people who have higher rates of exercise have lower rates of Alzheimer's. But beyond that, exercise changes gene expression and codes for the body to produce a chemical called BDNF that tells your brain to grow new brain cells. Who knew? You know, when I was, I hate to say when I was your age, but when I was your age, we were told that we were given a certain number of brain cells, and then as we, every beer we drank, we lost 30,000. Whatever it was, you'd lose X number of brain cells. Coke. Because we didn't know that you grow new brain cells. And how do you grow new brain cells? By exercising, by taking a fish oil supplement, by using turmeric in your cooking. This turns on the gene pathway. You can change your gene expression, grow new brain cells and stave off Alzheimer's. What's so hard about what I'm saying here? Right. It's really basic. And so do you think there's like a psychology to, like sometimes whenever you get into a path in life, whether it's an eating pattern or a, and you know it's detrimental, you know that the end is doesn't end well. Is there some term for a psychology to stay in that path almost out of spite or something, you know? There are a lot of terms. One is mindset. Okay. That your mind is set. In fact, I had, oddly enough at the interview this morning, and the question was, how does mindset come into play for health decisions? Your mind isn't set. You can change your mind, and the more you change your mind and then do the right thing, the better that pathway becomes, the more reinforcing it will be. The other thing I talk about is inconvenient truth. You know, Al Gore talked about the inconvenient truth, the climate change. I did a CBS this morning program a couple of months ago, and they said, no, Dr. Perlman has a new book. There's a new book talking about gluten and carbs and all that, but we reached out to the sugar industry and they told us we should eat more sugar because decades of research. And in my mind, it was hashtag, why that's fantastic, hashtag WTF, right? Isn't that what it's named for? Why that's fantastic. Yeah, okay, good. So in my mind, and then the lady gets on, she says, and then this morning I had, well, last night I had truffles because they're in season, truffle pasta with a jelly-filled donut or something. Jesus. And again, it's an inconvenient truth. What I'm saying to your audience today is an inconvenient truth. Why? Because we all have a sweet tooth. Oh, yes. We all would love to eat sweet and pasta. Oh, Don. Of course. It's comfort food because it stimulates the part of the brain for instant reward, dopamine surge, and your momentarily content. But oddly enough, that diet distances you from the executive center of the brain that lets you make better decisions, plan for the future, be more compassionate and empathetic for yourself, for the next person, and for the planet. Wow. So the more we distance ourselves from impulsivity, the better decisions we'll make, we'll get on an exercise regimen, we'll stay on it, and we'll choose to eat better foods that will enhance that. It's feed-forward. That's really interesting because impulse is that, it's almost just like that dirty magnet that's in us, and it just wants whatever the easiest, quickest hit is. Done. And then you need more of it. Ah, I see. You need more of it because it's a dopamine surge, stimulates the opiate receptors in your brain. Done. You've done your thing, and now you need more. And the more you do it, the more that receptor needs to be stimulated. And so choice is almost behind impulse a little bit. I mean, it's right there with it, but it's almost a gift to out-ride the impulse, I feel like. Exactly right. And for a second, and then be able to, that's what I feel for me. It's like, okay, I just need a second and make a choice. The moment you just did that, what you just did, Theo, is you stopped dealing and responding to your amygdala brain, your reptilian brain, that said, I'm gonna eat this, I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna punch this guy. And instead, I'm gonna decide that one moment is all the difference in the world. I'm gonna think about, do I really wanna eat this? Do I really want to, whatever the addiction may be, do I really wanna do this and now make a more sophisticated, more human rational decision to not do it. You've broken the spell, you can move forward. Wow. And does that get easier over time doing that? Absolutely. We talked about the growth of new brain cells. The same chemical, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF that you get from exercising, stimulates what we call neuroplasticity. That allows you to connect to that part of your brain. So these things then stick. And the more they stick, the better you get at it. It's like learning to hit a tennis ball. And then the better you feel about it. Does that impulse ever switch to the other? Yes. We need the other impulse. You need the other impulse because when you're back in your car out of the driveway and your mind sees in the backup camera, a little kid on her bike, you hit the brake. Yeah. You don't think, well, probably a good idea to hit the old brake pedal because this is going to turn out bad. So that's when the lizard really helps. You bet. You need that. You need that impulsive activity to make the right decision quickly. But you don't need it when you're trying to figure out what foods to buy in the grocery store. Can I make an excuse and not exercise today? Exercise is something that we don't have to, we don't want to find time for it. We want to make time for it. If you have to find time, you say, well, I'll squeeze it in between such and such and such and such. And then those things suddenly take over a little more time. You didn't exercise. You didn't meditate. You didn't take time to make the food that's good for you. You ate some crap. Fast food. Yeah. And our thinking's not good then. It's like our, it's really, we're kind of in a tough, it's a tough system. It's like we've created this, this sort of, I don't know if it's a comfort society or what it is, but it's, I mean, the system that we're in in a lot of places, now I'll say in LA, it's easier. It's very easier. It's much easier for me to stay healthier here. It really is. Then if I'm back in other place, like I'm from Louisiana, if I'm there, it is tougher. Like, you know, sometimes it's just tougher. So Theo, my team said, you got to watch these, a couple of his podcasts work on your show. Right. And I, I got to tell you, this is, there's no segue here whatsoever, but that's what this is about, right? And I didn't know what to expect, but I'm enjoying the heck out of it. This is great. Are you? Oh, absolutely. Good man. One of the main reasons and we'll get to it is, you know, I take antidepressants and a lot of times I get tired of, you know, it makes me feel like there's this, you know, there's something that's not natural. That's out there. That's added this connect, this, this taper to me, this, this, this chain, you know, like almost I'm a slave in a way to it a lot of times. And eventually maybe one day, I would like to maybe not take them. Now I'm not asking you for that, you know, direction now, but I do think, I start thinking, well, where are my other brains in my body? You know? And so then I started thinking about my stomach, you know, it's almost shaped in a way like, you know, it's, you know, your organs are almost like in a way for, to me or in my imaginative way, I work off of imagination first, kind of, it kind of is like a brain, something like, well, how could I learn more about like what I put in my stomach that could then affect how my brain behaves? And so then I was talking to my producer, and I was like, we got to get somebody that knows about this so that I can learn more about it, you know? And so that's basically where I started thinking about, you know, about having you on. And then I only read about 60 pages of of Grain Brain, but it was really fascinating to me, even in that little bit of time, I found some things that were really interesting, and so I'm glad you're here today, so I can talk to you about them. Well, who knew? Yeah. I mean, who knew that food has such an effect on every aspect of our lives. Let me get back to the imagination part, because I was really taken by that. You know, imagination is only a manifestation of connecting things that really happened. Right. You know, your reality comes together to form imagination. And in many ways, Oh, it's interesting. Well, it is. I mean, I know you're a neurologist first, right? First, I'm, I think, husband and father first. Okay, there you go. There we go. That's good. But yeah, I'm a neurologist. So you know about the brain? I know a little bit about the brain. Yeah. Who knew? Yeah. But I would say that. So imagination is sort of like what happens during sleep. So during sleep, we connect real events, real memories, and we measure them against each other. We form new ideas. Right. So imagination is based upon your reality, things that you have experienced or have imagined in the past. Those things were based on things that you have experienced. Wow. And let's get back to this connection of the gut to the brain, the stomach, which interestingly, I've never heard anybody say it was shaped. You're about to say it. Don't put words in your mouth. Looks like the brain a little bit. Yeah. Maybe if I didn't say that, that's what I meant. Yeah. So are pecans. Yeah. And walnuts too, right? But that said, depression is an inflammatory disorder. Now I want that to sink in. It's a disease characterized by higher levels of chemicals in your body that relate to a process called inflammation. Yeah. Now you're familiar with inflammation. You get bitten by a mosquito. Your hand gets inflamed. Yeah. But those same inflammatory chemicals are amped up in your body in relation to depression, in relation to Alzheimer's, autism, Parkinson's, coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancer. All those things have inflammation along. All inflammatory disorders. Wow. Which are so fundamentally related to not just your gut and things going on there, knowing that your gut bacteria determine what is called the set point of inflammation in your body, but even more importantly, to your food choices. Because you have to understand, you know, they say that when a woman is pregnant, she has to be careful. Now she's eating for two. Yeah, I've heard that. Theo, you're eating for 100 trillion. Right? Because of the future, my semen, all of that. No, your gut bacteria. Oh, I see what you're saying. So they're eating what you had for breakfast today. Oh, wow. Those 100 trillion bacteria float around your gut. What's Theo going to eat today? You know, is it a fiber-rich good food that we're going to be thrilled about? We're going to replicate. We're going to put out great chemicals. We're going to control the production of his brain chemistry. Right. Yeah, that's fascinating. We'll get back to that because you mentioned that earlier, that the things you eat affect emotionally how you're able to relate to other people. Is that true? Actually, that research was done right here in LA. Dr. Emron Mayer did some of the pioneering work on that. Can you write that down to me? Emron Mayer, good guy to have on the show. Emron, you owe me one. Wow, because... So I could potentially be able to love people better and learn about myself better if I eat better. I would tell you without a doubt. So here's what we need to craft for you. We need to craft for you a diet that reduces inflammation. Yeah. Fundamentally. I feel inflamed. Well, why do we see other inflammatory disorders along with depression? Why do we see skin inflammation, joint inflammation, those types of things? Obesity, which is an inflammatory disorder. The inflammation comes from fat cells. Wow. So why do these things all happen? Why do we see gross disturbances of gut bacteria? Because they're all related. So the trick then for you and any of the other 47 million, 27 million Americans who are suffering from depression, what do we offer up? We offer up a diet that's lower in its ability to produce inflammation. Okay. And that is a diet that's lower in sugar, lower in refined carbs, but has fiber, which is a carbohydrate. Fundamental point here. People say I'm going on a low carb diet and they ditch the fiber because it's a carb by definition. Right. It's the last thing in the world you want to do. You want to nurture your gut bacteria. Don't get rid of the fiber you need that. And, dare I say, eat more fat. Eat olive oil, avocado oil, avocados, nuts and seeds, grass-fed beef, wild fish. Get good fat, calm the fire. Who knew? Now, if you really want to push it, and you look like you probably want to push it, right? I think so. Good. I don't know what to find out. How old are you? I'm 38. Okay. Your birthday is tomorrow. Yep, my birthday is tomorrow. Okay. You'll be 39 tomorrow or you're 30? I'm going to be 39 tomorrow. Okay. So, you want to look into keto. You really want to look into the ketogenic diet. Would do you a world of good, but be sure, and to any of your listeners, viewers who are thinking keto or doing keto, you've got to eat the fiber. Okay. Or you'll get constipated. You'll have digestive issues. And you've got to use potassium and magnesium or you'll get the keto flu. Okay. So many people bail on the keto diet because they don't do those two things. Okay. So, you're saying, so a way to kind of start and to fast track some of the things that you've been talking about that will help your system and my system. Great pun there. Fast track. You want to fast. Yeah. Yeah, you want to fast. Oh, you want to fast. You want to fast. Do you want to fast? Well, first of all, because I'm slow, so I have to go through, I don't know, I'm sure my listeners are a lot quicker than me, but they always say I'm repeating stuff, but so, so a keto diet that we also add potassium and magnesium supplements. Now that could be vitamins. We could get those in a store. Yeah. I mean, there are things, there are online brands that you can get. And that's okay to add to it with the keto, but we don't have to, so a keto diet with those and then also fiber. Now, can that fiber be a supplement as well or does the fiber? Always choose food first. Okay. All right. So if we're talking about magnesium, let's be a little bit technical here. So chlorophyll is what makes things green. The center of the chlorophyll molecule is magnesium. So anything green that you eat in an easy manner, that's one way to know. So you want to get diversity. You want to get lots of color. You want to eat a lot of vegetables. They have a lot of fiber. If you really want the right kind of fiber for your gut bacteria, you use what is called prebiotic fiber. That's onions, garlics, leeks, chicory root. Oh, that's from Louisiana. All the coffins, chicory in it. There you go. They dilute it in the day, especially in World War II, but dandelion green. But you can go to the health food store and say, stand at the counter and say, I want some prebiotic fiber. I'm not saying probiotic. I'm saying prebiotic. And they have prebiotic fiber that's made from acacia gum. That's the tree in Africa. It secretes gum. Sustainably harvested. It's the best prebiotic you can find. Organic. It secretes gum. It's twice chewed then, if you get it, you know. I guess. It might be a bad joke. But what we can do though is we can put a list of like a basic kind of starter set of diet in this under this YouTube that would be, I think, really helpful to people. But let's talk about more that involves inflammation that you can leverage for depression. Okay. So want to do everything we can. Diet is key. Okay. Exercise, 20 minutes of aerobics, a day key. Being on schedule is really very important. We're trying to do the same thing every day that you possibly can. Not just what you eat, but when you eat. Try to eat your last food at least three hours before you go to bed. Okay. Yeah. So you want to be sleeping when you're sleeping, digesting during times that you're awake. You want to make sure you're getting good restorative sleep, like eight hours a night. That would be really important. And dare I say, you want to limit stress. And what does that mean? Everybody's talking about, I want to limit stress, so I don't do certain things. I don't engage in certain things. Stress can be watching the evening news. Stress can be on social media where we're being told we're not good enough. Yeah. And social media pounds you with ideology that we're not measuring up. That everybody else's life is better. You look at their Instagram posts. They're having the best time. Why is my life not so great? So stop comparing ourselves to other people. That will look, that's the biggest stress inducer I think of in our modern time. So get off of this merry-go-round where everybody else looks like they have, I got news for it. They aren't. Right. They're all having a great time. They are wonderful. They aren't. Yeah, they're not sharing the truths a lot of times. Yeah. Which would probably, if they did, it might even alleviate some people's stress to know that we aren't the same. Do you really, yeah, I guess in your lifetime you've probably seen, and I don't think you're much older than me, but I bet in your lifetime that you've seen, has that really shocked you the way that social media stuff has become that much of a stressor? Absolutely. And I'm a lot older than you. I'm 64. You look good for 64, Dr. Perlmutter. I'm trying. Yeah. It has shocked me and my son, Austin Perlmutter, also an MD, to the extent that we've written a book about it. Wow. And that's coming out in January of 2020 called Brain Wash. A, we're calling attention to this issue, and B, we're providing the response what you can do to offload this stuff. Yeah. How you can sleep better, why exercise is important, how the food that you eat speaks to your genes. Giving your genes information to reduce inflammation or increase inflammation, your choice based upon what you eat. But to identify this very obvious way that we are being manipulated on social media and in our digital world, not just for producing this feeling of low self-worth, but providing the quick clickbait answer to satisfy, look, I'm overweight, buy this thing, lose weight quickly. And all these ideas for quick and sudden, that's redundant, ways to satisfy ourselves getting back to the impulsivity part of the brain. Where we're saying, look, stop. If you think you need to buy stuff every day on Amazon because that makes you feel better, stop. Wait 24 hours and then buy it. If this is a quick fix for your problem, take a deep breath. But don't be misled by what you're seeing on digital media as to what your value is. So Facebook shouldn't determine Theo's value. What you think of yourself. You talk about depression. What goes on in terms of manipulating your online choices is a situation that absolutely creates depression. And so like, give me an example of that. So what goes on, like the things that I do online and how I behave on there and what I see on there, you mean can immediately make me feel a certain way? Absolutely because what it's doing is it's catering your brain to continued relationship with the amygdala, the reptilian brain. Immediate response. You feel bad about yourself for this. Buy that and you're done. You've satisfied that. You get the dopamine hit as soon as it arrives the next day on Amazon Prime or they drop it in your backyard with a drone or however the next new way of you satisfying that urge. And then it came and you suddenly realize, I need more. I'm not content. Whereas contentment means you have enough. That's the prefrontal cortex. You have achieved a place where you don't need more. You've achieved a place of happiness, of empathy and compassion for other people, of being able to calm yourself and make appropriate decisions about your life and make decisions about your life and about caring for your neighbor, about caring for people who are different than you are and about caring for the planet. Wow. So that care. It's amazing that so much emotion can come from what we eat and that I can definitely see how, like if you had less inflammation, so less inflammation means less stress. Absolutely. Okay. And so less stress, of course, then you're going to be, it's going to be easier for you to be patient with someone. It's going to be easier for you to be more understanding. It's going to be easier for you to take that extra second to make a choice so you're not just being that reptile. But it seems like all the advertising and everything these days were catapulting humanity towards just using that reptilian brain. That's right. So we've got to stop that. Do you think we can? I'm going to do my best. And Austin Pearlmutter is doing his best to put the information out, brainwash, about what people can do. And one other really important part of the program is reconnecting with nature. And that can be having a plant in front of you when you're doing a podcast. Or it can be walking in nature and breathing better air. What about candles even? I noticed when I have candles around that I feel so much different than when I have regular lights on. Candles are a visual. We are attracted to fire. It's very calming. But in addition, there are scents of candles, which hopefully are natural. And that's another reason that forests, being in the forest, really reconnect us. That's a very deep and primitive part of our brain that's reactivating. Yeah. Man, it's crazy to think kind of like, just where we're headed then, you know. I read in your book that there's, like sometimes you think like, okay, I'm having this thing that my ancestors had, this primitive sort of diet. And it was about wheat. A part of it was about a wheat or something. But that the wheat that we have now is nothing like the wheat that they had then. Well, let's put it in perspective. And I'm not prepared for raising. Let's put it in perspective. Our ancestors didn't have wheat. Okay. So wheat only came into the picture 14,000 years ago to be generous, which means for 99.6% of our time walking this planet, we didn't have wheat. Wow. We didn't have barley. We didn't have any of that stuff. I mean, that's when agriculture began. You know, the size of our brain increased three fold from two million years ago up until about 14,000 years ago. And then it stopped? Then it's declined 10% since then. Jesus. So think about that. So, you know, everybody credits agriculture with, you know, with all these great advances in humanity, you know, the development of cities and our social, true social networking. But in reality, it has represented the greatest change in human diet ever. So, you know, that sort of segues to the so-called paleo movement. And I think to grasp that, you really have to understand that food is information. What do I mean by that? That the foods you eat, yeah, it nurtures your gut bacteria. We talked about that, which is hugely important in and of itself. But it also sends important information about your environment to your DNA. You are controlling the expression of your DNA based upon the foods that you eat. So if I eat healthy stuff, I'm letting my DNA know that I'm in a healthy environment and that everything's okay. And then your DNA creates antioxidants. Right. It helps you detoxify. It's at the beach. It makes chemicals to grow more brain cells. Yeah. And it lets you feel better about the world. Whereas... If I have two boxes of tartan tines, and then my DNA says, Jesus Christ. I don't know tartan tines. Oh, just like a... It sounds bad. I'm trying to get a candy. A tartan tine didn't grow in nature. Yeah. Sweet tarts. Sweet tarts. Remember those. Or sugar tootsie rolls. Yeah. You're reaching back. I'm trying to find milk duds. Neck away first. Neck goes right there. That was perfect. Dude, that's crazy, bro. I know. Wow. We're gonna take a poetic pause here. But when you do that, you eat that food. So you have the artificial colors, the artificial flavors, lots and lots of sugar. Yeah. That sends signals to your DNA that amplifies the production of inflammatory chemicals, reduces your production of antioxidants, and compromises your detox pathways. So you're eating poison, and at the same time, you're compromising your ability to get rid of poison. So you're setting yourself up for disaster. Now, when can you have some poison? Like, when can you, like, sometimes, look, man, if I've been on a flight to New York, and I've walked by that Dunkin' Donuts, bro, I gotta have one, you know? I can't even, and they got the lady over there looking at me. So the lady's like, there's a lot of advertising, three or four different colors, red and bright colors. I want you to realize, to take a step back and think that that's playing on you. That's playing on that quick dopamine surge. Who's in charge? That lizard. That's what you ask yourself. What I do, look for a mirror. Look yourself in the mirror. I'm asking myself one question. Who's in charge? Larry Duncan. Usually, bro, I go straight for that Dunkin' Donuts. They get me. A lot of times things don't get me, though. A lot of times things don't get me. But can you celebrate once in a while? I mean, you can't. Absolutely. Do you ever celebrate? Like, who will have a birthday cake if it's someone's birthday? Not so much. You know, my cells didn't know that it's your birthday tomorrow. They don't know that yesterday was St. Pat. Whatever is a holiday. Every day could be a holiday. I'm sure it's somebody's birthday every day, right? Your cells don't know it's Thanksgiving or Christmas. They don't take the day off. So, again, from my perspective, having dealt with patients and their maladies for all these years, having dealt with a father who died of an illness that's related to lifestyle choice, and my mother as well as a cigarette smoker, I realized that your choices matter all lack of a lot. When Theo says you look younger than 64, God, I'm thinking keep at it. You know, stay with it. But beyond that, get the message out. Do the best you can to get the message out for other people because people are absolutely struggling. You walk through that airport, whatever time of day it is, and you look at what people look like. A, most people are overweight and look awful. And B, they're not happy. And C, what I've learned and what was motivation for this new book is people are lonesome and unconnected. And we can do what we can to let people feel comfortable with reconnecting to others who are different from them, who look different, whose ideas are different. And we stop. We listen to what that person has to say. You know, you ever heard this saying, you know, if you're going to judge somebody, you have to walk a mile in their shoes before you say something about them. You know why they say that? Because then when you judge them, you're already a mile away. Right. And you have their shoes. So, I mean, you know. I like that. Now, where do you go? Where do you go with that? I stumped you. Yeah, I think I am stumped. So, now you talked about prebiotics earlier, and we'll put a couple of those on and you can go to your health store and ask what they are. So, you recommended for kind of a, not a fast track, but to get started in a place that would have a diet that is better for you that would cause less stress and cause less inflammation in your body, would be a keto diet with magnesium and potassium supplements and some prebiotics. That would be a great start. Lots of fiber. Yeah. Now, after you to start this, what are signs that you could look for that it's having an effect in your life? And that happens quickly. Wow. Usually a couple of weeks. You wake up refreshed. You want to open the curtains and let the light in. So many things that we could talk about in terms of that. Keep that in mind. But people feel better, more energetic, clearer of mind. You know, a lot of people don't realize that they're a bit foggy until suddenly the fog lifts. I realize that all the time. Yeah. Sometimes I'm like, man, what is, it's like there's this kind of smog in my head and it really feels physically like that, like a very thin smoke helmet. Exactly. You know, and I don't use drugs or alcohol. Well, in the day, we used to listen to FM radio a lot. Yeah. And now everything is, of course, digital, but on an FM radio, you'd be driving your car. And if there is lightning, you couldn't even see it. It was way out in the distance somewhere. That would strike. You would hear it on the radio. The music would be interrupted. You'd hear the sound. Oh, it's cool. And that's what inflammation does to your thought process. When you've got high levels of inflammation in your body, it's like that lightning going off in the background and the music gets interrupted. So when the inflammation starts to get toned down, your memory improves and you start to see things clearly. The fog will lift. It happens quickly. Then the weight loss begins. And people look at the mirror and notice their face looks better. People comment. You go to your next belt loop, roll in your belt, and people start to feel better. And it doesn't take long. And what's good about that is, let's say it takes two weeks, that is self-reinforcing. I'm doing it. I'm finally doing it. I know. How good does that feel, too? I am not on a diet. It's not XYZ diet. You buy a book or go on whatever it is. I don't have to go to meetings. I'm just eating the right foods. My body is responding because your body wants to be healthy. It wants to resist disease. Your brain wants to work. Your brain wants to resist disease. And your mood, I think your body, your brain wants you to be happy. You were gifted this lifetime and you were gifted, I believe, the desire and the ability to enjoy life and not be depressed. Depression happens when things line up and then it's feet forward. The more depressed you are, the less likely you are to exercise, the less likely you are to make the right food choices. With all due respect, the more likely you are to give in to Dunkin' Donuts or whatever else is bombarding your mind with ideas that this is what you should do for that immediate surge, that glazed donut that's going to give you that dopamine surge that then stimulates your endogenous, opiate receptors. And I believe that that is a big player in terms of opiate addiction, that we constantly bombard ourselves with, first, the dopamine surge that then makes these opiate receptors want more. They're ready. And of course, there's opiates. There's opioids. They're there, ready and willing to. Snackable, snack size now. Back in the day, you had to smoke opium. And now they got a little snack. They got the pills. Yeah, a vape pen practically. I'm surprised opioid hadn't come out with a vape pen. And I like the THC products that are shaped like pacifiers. What is the signal we are sending to children there? Infants. Yeah, I mean, that's certainly an adult play toy. Oh, toddlers are sleeping for three days on some of these pacifiers. I want to get back to you, really. Great, the kids sleep them. Everything's good. We can go out. We used to have a kid, we'd go over to his house, this boy, Jeff Soviac, and they had a gas leak in their house, right? And nobody ever knew. And we would go over there and go to sleep. We'd sleep on Friday. We'd go to sleep on Friday night, like 2 a.m. Dude, we'd get up Sunday morning, man. We'd sleep for like 32 hours. We had no idea that they had whatever kind of gas that is, you know. Want to hold Jeff Soviac's doing these days? I don't know. I don't know where he is. And actually, I've tried to text him and call him. So I wish he would reach back out. Jeff is out there. We did the update. We would sleep forever, man. His whole family would be asleep. You'd walk by his mom, we'd be making a salad and she would just be unconscious. Really? Yeah, they had like a, I guess it's carbon monoxide or something. Something in their house. Yeah, usually it's a pretty much more aggressive kind of event that happens with carbon monoxide as opposed to going on for a year after your butt could be. Yeah, it must have been, it might have been like a slow leak or whatever, but. Yeah. But it was relaxing. But anyway. We had mentioned about, you know, you wake up in the morning, throw up in the curtains, get a lot of light in, and I think. Yeah. So you naturally start to do that? Oh, yeah. Wow. I think the light story is something we can touch on since we're there. There's not huge segues here. Go wherever we want. Yeah, no, we don't. And sometimes we never know how these conversations are going to go. It's like, sometimes it's, you know, you just never know. And that's what our list, that's what podcast listeners and I enjoy as a listener is just, you know, two people talking that don't know each other. And, you know, one of them having information about something and one of them not, you know. Well, I'd say that, you know, we're just really getting the handle on how circadian rhythms affect the human body. Right. And we, you know, we really realize that every cell in our body is a response to the circadian day, circa around dia day. Okay. Circadian rhythm, that it's all of ourselves, including our gut bacteria, respond to various times of the day. There's a great book called The Circadian Code by Dr. Asachin Panda. Great, be a great guest for you. But nonetheless, I mean, he talks about how it's really important for us, Matthew Walker too, for his book, Why We Sleep. Oh yeah, I actually read about half of that book. Keep on Joe Rogan, I think. Yeah, but about, you know, that we need to have blue light during the day, that we should get out and experience blue light, really have exposure to bright sunlight, because that really will tamp down melatonin. And then in the evening time, we want to back down off blue light significantly. And where are we getting blue light? I mean, these LEDs are, we're loading ourselves a blue light right now. We are. We don't want to do that at nighttime because that would suppress melatonin and keep us from getting restorative sleep. Very underrated in terms of how important that is for you, for reducing cortisol surges, for reducing inflammation. So getting what we call salubrious or restorative sleep is incredibly important. And it's underrated. I mean, you spend the third of your life hopefully sleeping. Yeah. And what about those melatonin supplements? Those are okay to take? I think they are. Yeah. But I would say before we supplement, it would be good to do it more naturally. Right. And recognize what is it that allows melatonin to be present or absent. And it's mostly blue light. Light. So that get a lot of blue light in the daytime. Evening comes around, you want to back down. If you're going to be on your computer or looking at your iPhone or whatever phone you may have, you put on amber glasses. Because that blocks blue light and is very, very helpful in terms of allowing your brain then to make more melatonin, allowing you to get some restorative sleep. Now, you may have sleep apnea. You may have periodic leg movements that are waking you up at night. Yeah, the legs I do. I got checked for the sleep apnea. I don't have it. Yeah. But you may have leg movements that wake you up. So you're getting into deep sleep. But then your legs start to move around. You get into a lighter stage of sleep that's not as restorative. How would you know that? Yeah. It's a lot of time. Yeah. So you may not know that. That's why you get a sleep study. You go into a lab and they watch. Oh, yeah. I went there. Yeah. And it's a little odd. It was crazy. This dude was flirting with me. This was that light. This guy started crying. Yeah. He was like, dude, I ain't going to sleep in an ear. I know. And then he got the cameras watching you and all kinds. But anyway, it's worth doing. I mean, you know, there is other things like the aura ring is a great thing. I'm going to hope to get mine in the next couple of weeks. And raise that. The aura ring you put on your hand, you wear it all the time, measures your level of activity, but is able to measure the depth and quality of your sleep. Oh, gee. You wake up in the morning, this thing downloads into your phone and tells you, hey, you got X number of hours in this stage of sleep and that stage of sleep. And then, you know, you work with that. And that seems reliable, that piece. Actually, I'm interviewing the president of that. God, you are good. The founder of that company next week and going to learn more about it. So I'm very excited about it. I wonder anything that you can learn that can hack your body and give you tools. I'm all about it. It's time to do that. I mean, it's going on. We have so much information now. Yeah. I think get your 23andMe or other online company that will give you a report of your genome. You need that information. You can do great stuff with once you take that data, download it to one of many different sites. I recently downloaded mine to found my fitness. That's Rhonda Patrick. Great site. And I learned stuff about myself that I think is really important. I learned, for example, that I don't metabolize or use B vitamins very effectively. I have to have a special type of B vitamin called methylated B vitamins. I never would have known it. Wow. So who knew? But do you find that like, sometimes I worry that get like the information like sometimes I use an app when I go run or something and getting that information, it takes the joy out of doing the task. Do you ever find that? Is that just some way my brain is searching me? No, no, no. I think there's been a lot of pushback. And I think there has to be some level of temperance as it relates to that. I mean, I don't run with an app. I don't run with a special watch. And so I don't know unless I'm training for an event. Having said that, I do want to know my miles, my minutes per mile. But otherwise, I don't get involved in that. I do like to listen to music. So I find that really helpful or podcast when I'm running. But I think that people can overdo it. There's been pushback with a lot of these things that measure all these parameters that it's way too much. It's information overload. Right. But I will say that knowing your genome once is a good bit of information to have. Okay. Because you could take that information and dump it onto any number of sites and learn some stuff about yourself that's really going to turn out to be helpful. And you know, how can you learn about your genome? 23andMe. Okay. You spit in a test. Oh yeah, I did that. Yeah. You get back your data. Yeah. But that doesn't really helpful. Then you take your data, you drag it onto your desktop. This says Theo's data right here. Then there are any number of sites. Wow. One of them is Found My Fitness, Rhonda Patrick. Yeah. She's a great guest. Dr. Rhonda Patrick, right? She's been on Rogan a bunch. Yeah. I thought we almost reached out to her one time. You should reach out to her. You will. In fact, I got connected to her this morning. Nice. Only. I mean, so I'll ask her if it's okay to connect with you. Yeah. It'd be interesting. But she has a website. You go to her website. You drag the file. You drop it. Next thing you know, you get a report. Her algorithm tells you various things that you need to know about yourself. Wow. How you handle dietary fat. What level of various activities you could engage in. What are your, how do you handle B vitamins? Fascinating. Yeah. There are a lot of those sites too. They tell you, it's great to have the data. You know who your ancestors were. You know what percentage of your genome is Neanderthal. How is that helpful? I don't know. But beyond that, there's a lot of stuff you should know. That we can use. Yeah. Especially if we can, there's another way. It's just interesting to know there's another way to use that information because I don't even know that. I'll help you with it. Okay. Cool. Yeah. No, that'd be awesome. I had a, I just want to know a little bit more about, do you think that people could eventually, I mean, obviously, you know, this is something people always need to discuss with their doctors, but get off of antidepressants. I knew you're going there and I would say that let's make this our goal, you and I. Yeah. Let's do that. Okay. Okay. All right. How cool would it be for you on your program to say, you know, I've been off whatever it is, I don't know if you told your audience what you're taking. Yeah. I think I don't know. Yeah. I just switched to something else, vibrate or something. All right. So how, how cool would that be that you say, I did this, this and this, and I've been off my antidepressant for X period of time. I'll try. You'll work with your doctor. I am not your doctor. You'll work with your doctor. But we'll talk about some lifestyle issues that may pave the way for letting that happen or not. Wow, dude. That's crazy. Are you? I guess I'm in. It would be silly for me to say I'm not in. You know, I'm always talking about doing things different and, uh, taking some contrary action. So I'm ready to do it. I think maybe that's even why you're, you know, one of the reasons, you know, for me while you're here today, um, you know, I mean, selfishly, but that'd be awesome. Totally reasonable. Yeah. You're not the only one who's watching this. That's a good point. Sorry to interrupt the episode, but, um, you know, I gotta let you know something right here and something right here is called uncommon apothecary and an apothecary is some of that helps you, somebody that makes you up a sweet tincture or something, you know, a salve or something like that that gets you to the other side of goodness. And today's episode is brought to you by this company, uncommon apothecary CBD. You might have heard of it. It's from the hemp plant, but unlike its sister, Mary Jane CBD contains less than 0.3 percent THC. It won't get you high, but it'll stop you from feeling low. Several double blind studies have shown CBD to reduce anxiety. Well, honestly, for me, nothing would seem more anxious than being double blind. Also, CBD has been known to alleviate depression as well as pain and inflammation. I even like to add some of my coffee or put a little drippy, drappy under my tongue or under my cousin's tongue and watch him feel better. First of all, it's legal without prescription in all 50 states. Head over to UA-CBD.com today and use the code THEO at checkout to receive 15% off and see why thousands are switching from prescriptions to a more natural alternative. For every item purchased, uncommon apothecary will donate $1 to local homeless shelters, and hopefully they'll dip the homeless straight into a sweet vat of CBD oil.

So let's get to a couple of those. What's up, Theo? Dr. Pearl Mooder, gang, gang, gang, bud, coming at you from an oil rig in Oklahoma. Oh, wow. Yeah. I'm reading the book right now, Grain Brain, really interesting stuff, not all the way through it. So I apologize if I say anything wrong, but then I go on the news or something and I find that Northwestern study about eggs and cholesterol and how it's linked to heart disease. So my question is just kind of how do we sift through what's good knowledge and bad knowledge? How do we kind of get to the bottom of it? But thanks for coming on the show. Thanks for talking about it. Makes a lot of sense. I'm really enjoying the book. So y'all take it easy. Thank you. You're another gang, man. What's his name? Ben. Ben. Ben. So a study just came out saying that higher levels of cholesterol consumption or egg consumption are linked to all cause mortality as well as risk for coronary vascular disease. So eggs are bad again? Pardon me? Eggs are bad again? Let me finish because here's my response. There we go. Higher egg in cholesterol consumption, hikes heart disease and death threats. I have a half a omelet in me right now. Yeah, me too. And let's talk about that. What does it mean? How do they do the study? They did, they asked people what do you eat, which is notoriously and interesting, maybe not the best way of determining what people are truly eating. People want to answer their questions right. They want to lie. And they determined cholesterol consumption based upon certain, their frequency of consuming foods higher in cholesterol. And I think it's a good study. I think it tells us some important information, but it doesn't address quality. The quality of the eggs that people consume is very important. Oh, really? There's no alchemy that happens when chickens eat garbage in a factory and then produce eggs. And if, if you want to see a simple example of that, go to a farm, a regular farm, get an egg, go to the grocery store and buy an egg, crack them both open and just look at them. Totally different. What do you see? Yeah. One of them is a little bit darker. The, the yolk is a little bit richer. Richer in carotenoids. Almost has some coloring in it. You bet. And the other one just looks like we could have made it if we had a couple hours. Yeah. And there you go. And the same thing deals with meat consumption. I mean, do I believe that in general meat consumption is a health risk? I do. Do I think the China study, Dr. Colin Campbell's book about risk for colon cancer, one of the things you mentioned, increased with meat consumption, you bet I do. I do. But the point is this is asking a person or large groups of people, do you eat meat or do you not eat meat? End of story. You're in one category or the other. It's not asking, do you eat meat that you get at the grocery store that came from a factory where they fed these cattle, garbage, genetically modified, sprayed with, who knows what, antibiotic treated on and on versus do you eat meat that's grass fed from animals that are roaming free and not exposed to toxins? Yeah. Cause traumatic. Cause then you're just getting second hand inflammation from the meat. A hundred percent. You got, you got that when you nailed it on the head. Jesus man. So that's the point. That's the information. How was the cow feeling? They should write that on there on the back of the thing, you know, Lance was doing well, you know, but it would be like saying, we're going to do a study to determine if alcohol consumption is good or bad for your heart and not determining any difference between whether that alcohol comes from a glass of organic red wine versus some rotgut scotch that you buy at a convenience store. It's all alcohol. No, it's not. It's all meat. No, it's not. I see. So I think it's really important to look at this information. I think it's very valid. I think Ben's question was good. But having said that, we've got to do a science that looks at quality of the foods that people are eating. Okay. Would I say that eating eggs from the grocery store might not be a good choice? Yeah. I would say that. Same thing with the meat. I wouldn't. I wouldn't eat that stuff. Wow. And I think to be fair, more vegetarian of a diet is a good choice. We are now at a place of one meal a day being plant based and moving forward. Our next book is talking about OMD, one meal a day being plant based. And so now when you say, so people can switch if they need to from a lot of these, because a lot of people, you know, we're in regular towns, you know, like, in my town growing up, like, I don't know if I was there, if I would, I mean, maybe I would have access to these things. First, I would have to seek them out. I could probably get like fresh or meat because there's like a lot of venison and that sort of stuff. It would just, I have to call a local distributor and find out what their route is and how they usually go about delivering stuff. But you're saying that that's a smarter move to organize something like that than to just be going to the grocery store and get it. I want to repeat what you just said. Yeah. And it was very important. Your viewers need to hear this and that is you're going to have to seek it out. And that is the difference between finding time to do something and making time. It's about priority. So if we're going to prioritize food and we should prioritize exercise and prioritize sleep, that's the key to health. That's the key to getting rid of depression. That's the key to reducing our risk for chronic degenerative conditions, moving forward. Those things have to move to the top of the list because after all, you know, if you don't have your health, then nothing else matters. Yeah. Yeah. And we have this, there's this feeling these days you're just going to kind of, it's hard to know, it's hard to feel the long term in the short term, you know what I'm saying? You know, in my world where, you know, a lot of our work deals with Alzheimer's disease, we now recognize as we talked about a while ago now, that the changes begin in your twenties and thirties. And you don't know that until you listen to people who are studying that and who are, you know, making that information known. Let's see. I hope this person is not driving, right? Well, hopefully he is, dude. He's probably stressed if he has this could be inflammation. No, he's in the right seat. His question was related to dementia. Hey, what's up Theo? Gang gang. What's up player? I'm in Daytona for spring break, but I wanted to give my question in for that guy, the brain guy. I forgot his name, but anyways, when you go see a doctor a while back, they said my B12 levels were really, really low. So low. In fact, the guy said that it contributed to giving me bad headaches as I get migraines and headaches. He said that if I don't start taking B12 and taking them seriously, I can have early onset dementia in my thirties. Can I ask you a question? Oh, no, we can't do it. It's not live. Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry. We didn't tell you that. Yeah. People submit these, submitted these yesterday. Well, let's, let's, let's respond to that. Okay. A, one would wonder why in the heck did his doctor check his B12 level? And I would say probably had nothing to do with his headaches. It had to do with this. I don't mean technical, the size of his red blood cells. Okay. So your red blood, your red cells are the larger, I mean, the lower your B12 level is higher, bigger size, your red blood cells. Because they're stressed out? No, it has to do with their construction. But that said, he's not alone. There are a lot of people going around with a low B12 level. The brain is desperate for B12. So where do you get B12? Well, you get it from organ meats. You get it from, you can get it from vegetables if the vegetables have been washed like organic vegetables, and dare I say, might have a little dirt on them. Right. So go to these farmer's markets and hit these things up, make that part of your week if you can. But here's the biggest reason. I believe that people have low B12 levels. It's because of the over usage in our society of these acid blocking drugs. So we need stomach acid to activate what's called intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor helps us bind B12 and absorb it. Everybody thinks that they have indigestion, they ate some kind of sandwich. Tums all day. All day long. You see commercials. The guy's trying to eat a sausage sandwich, and the sandwich turns away from him because they don't get along. Oh, I remember when I worked on this farm, we would make these little tumburgers. We'd get three of them and stack them and eat them. Don't tell me that. Yeah. All right. So case in point. So when you inhibit stomach acid, you compromise B12 absorption, your B12 level goes down. So his doctor is giving him, recommending B12 orally, I'm not his doctor. But if a person had that low a B12 level, I don't know if how low it was. We would definitely start with some injections. So that's something you could also possibly do is whenever you go back to your doctor, talk about also injections, make sure you're not taking too much calcium or too many tums or those type of acids because those will stop the acid, which you need to help process the B12. Beyond those, the calcium base, these other types of acid blockers that work, well, proton pump inhibitors, if I may say a thing, also drugs like Zantac and Nexium and Pepsidac or AC, these OTCs, over the counter drugs, which people take, they, everybody thinks because they get an upset stomach after they eat some food, they need to pop an ant acid. Yeah. Well, if you're getting an upset stomach after you eat a food, you sure as heck shouldn't be eating that food. There's a mechanism in place that says, if you eat food that's not good for you, you're going to get an upset stomach. You should pay attention to that. Not try to cover it up by taking acid blocking drug. We need stomach acid. That's what activates our ability to absorb B12. It activates our digestive enzymes. The last thing in the world you want to do is inhibit your stomach acid unless you have some other issues. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome for those tech weenies who want to know about. Really get in there. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds like the damn dark arts. Zollinger-Ellison. No. That's what we're going to do. We're going to probably whoop his ass. I'm going to say that. Sorry to use that kind of terminology in front of your dog. I think it was two guys first of all. Okay. It was a long time ago. Oh, it's two on one. Do somebody, yeah. Us three could take them. Yeah. Us three could take them. Do you want to, do you have something, Nick? We got another question. Okay. Great. Hey, Theo, hey, David. I was wondering as a neurologist, David, what's your opinion on treating depression, anxiety, et cetera, et cetera with psilocybin? That's a terrific question. It's a big question. We just lost one of our comedians a couple of weeks ago who ended up taking his own life and he hung himself. I hate to say that because it almost sounds even grotesque, almost saying that because you know it's, but he was, even according to the guy who dropped him off that evening, he was doing as normal as he ever is. He'd gotten off some medicine and was getting back on without like talking to his doctor. So that's what it seems like people are equating it to some, some crevasse in that moment mentally where he just couldn't escape it. But anyway, back to his question. Yeah. This is very pertinent. Yeah. It's an excellent question. We're seeing some, dare I say. Do we want to explain, yeah, psilocybin, like a hallucinogen. So it's a hallucinogen. Yeah. Right. So, but we're seeing with specifically relation to psilocybin, some, dare I say, some very positive response in terms of serious depression and things like PTSD. I think we're early in the research, though it's been going on a long time, I think the real dedication to the research is in its infancy and I'm all in favor of looking at it further. I mean, you know, this began in the 60s and 70s and was in the 90s too, dude in Covington, Louisiana. I mean, that's where I was. It was well on its way. It was, yeah. Or yeah, it was passing through, I'll say that. Is it something that you've ever tried? Have you ever experimented with psilocybin? Have I ever tried mushrooms? I have. Yeah. Did you find it from like, in this, did you already have your knowledge base so you could kind of examine it like that? No, I did not. I mean, my current knowledge base, no, this was years, this was in college. Right. It, you know, in terms of contextualizing for me, I can't say that it did that in terms of, you know, letting me see the world in a different way. I would say it was only, it was momentary. So that said, you know, I don't know what the future holds for me, but you know, when you see books now on the New York Times best settler list, Michael Pollan's book, I think that there's a lot of information there that we need to look at because I think there's some value there. And I think the rejection of hallucinogens from a therapeutic perspective was done for the wrong reasons. You know, I think the declaration, the war on drugs and how that everything got out of hand during the Nixon era really set back the possibility of this being all drugs became this stigma. You bet. Yeah. So I don't take anything off the table that's going to help people, especially as it relates to depression. So anywhere between 40 to 70% of suicides are in people who have significant issues with depression. And let me just make one point that you will work with your doctor moving forward, unlike what may have happened to your comedian friend. But you know, we'll try to maximize those other things to give you support in terms of your lifestyle. Yeah. I'm curious. Yeah. Look, I'm excited about trying this. One diet before, for a while, I can't remember what it was. You're doing paleo. Oh, paleo for a while. And it was good. Sometimes I could barely even see, though. I think one time I didn't eat for, that might have been fasting. You fast for five days. Y'all was at a Best Buy. I couldn't see, but about six feet. But that's really all you need to see at a Best Buy. You buy whatever's there at six feet in your field of vision and that's good enough. And you go back next year because what you bought is now obsolete. Actually, it is a great way to... You got to buy the extended warranty in a matter of... You can buy a USB drive and they're going to even extend the warranty for 19 years. Oh, I'd have bought 12 extended feet of sight if I could have in that joint. 18 feet, who knows what I would have found. But it kind of is nice to minimize the store. It's kind of nice to minimize the store and make it smaller. Blue light everywhere. Very much blue light. Want to suppress that meltdown? So you're dialed in. Yeah. You know what? I'm even noticing even when I go out to like, if I'm at a bar or a club, there's a lot more people who are out on mushrooms in low doses. Whereas it used to be people were high or people were drinking, it's becoming a more common thing. Say, I'll see a group of friends and they're just hanging out and chatting, but like, oh, we took some mushrooms. It's becoming more of a, I don't even know if it's experimental, but almost more managed. The term micro dosing came out about five years ago and then it became more, I feel like people started to see, oh, this is more manageable and it's maybe being delivered in more manageable supplements. So let me then contextualize my statement and I would say that I am, my statement should not be generalized to the recreational use, but more in terms of a therapeutic intervention under supervision. I think there's a lot of, a lot of potential there to really make things happen in a much shorter period of time as opposed to years and years of psychotherapy. Yeah. It has a potential for that. Right. And that was not a commentary on the recreational use. Oh no. I don't think that anybody, I don't think anybody would take it like that, but thanks for clarifying that. Nick, was there anything else? I had a question about sugar. Is there a real difference with your body from natural sugars in fruit to like refined sugars? And you're that agave bad boy. I read that a little bit. That's your jam, huh? You bet. Yeah. So I'm often asked that question, what is, you know, people say, oh, I had honey that came from bees that meditated every hour and it's great. It's sugar. Your body reads it as sugar. You know, I'm from Florida, so orange juice is a big thing there, right? And a 12 ounce glass of orange juice, whether it's from Florida or California is nine teaspoons of sugar in a 12 ounce glass of Florida, 34 to 36 grams of carbohydrate in your, that's before you've had your croissant or bagel, which are fancy names, you bet. And that's breakfast. Your blood sugar surges, then it crashes, then 10 o'clock in the morning, you're in trouble, you can't, you're back at Best Buy again, or Costco, and you're trying to be sick in front of you. Just loitering. Right now, loitering and getting picked up. And so. How is loitering not a disease, dude, that some people are just, that's all they do. I know, I like loitering. Loitering is a great thing. I got, you know, just to take in the moment, be present, be mindful. That's a good point, actually. But that said, you know, your question is very good about eating fruit. And this notion of six to eight servings of fruit today, it's way too much fructose and glucose. You got to go more green. You got to get on the other side. You bet. And, you know. What about fruit juice? Sorry, just to clarify. Oh, that's, that's. Freshly squeezed. Look, a freshly squeezed orange juice has the same amount of sugar as Coca-Cola. Jesus. What's the mystery here? But it's, oh yeah. But it's got vitamin C. I mean, please. You're going to offset nine teaspoons of sugar with the 80 milligrams of vitamin C in terms of being good for you. That's the trade-off. I don't think so. There's, you know, have water, have carbonated water, have fruit-flavored water. There are lots of them out there right now. I just tried a new one and I thought it was great. So like for breakfast, man, I just don't want to not be able to, I mean, I feel like it's going to be hard. What can I eat then? Well, you might try skipping breakfast. Really? You might try having your first meal a day at noon or one o'clock. Yeah. I'm smarter if I skip breakfast. I notice my brain works better. Well, if you eat, let's say you eat at one o'clock. That's when you, so you had dinner the night before at seven. You've gone all that time fasting. Then you have a meal that's called break fast. You broke your fast at one o'clock in the afternoon. You build up those ketones. You're stressing your DNA a little bit. A low-grade stress, we call that hormesis, amplifying your longevity genes, turning on pathways, NRF2 pathway for those who care to increase your antioxidant production, increase detoxification, decrease inflammation. It is the home run. And who knew? I don't know who invented three meals a day, but somebody one day said three meals a day that said, if you don't do that. Probably Bob Evans. I don't know if you've ever been to a Bob Evans steakhouse or not, or that breakfast joint, but he's had at least four. I know Bob Evans. I bet they wanted to say four, and they talked about it. If they could, they would, you know, the midnight snack. That would be the worst time in the world to, and people get up and have a bowl of cereal with less milk. I had one last night. So what do you have in the middle of that? If you have to have something, you're hungry, you have to have something. You can't, though. You got to sleep, man. It's just driving you nuts. If I ever woke up and had to do something aside from pee, I'd say I would probably eat half an avocado. There you go. Yeah. I like that. I'd fill a little hole after you take the seed out, I'd fill the hole with olive oil, and then a little sea salt. That's my favorite. I can eat that and be one and done. Dude, my dad used to put mayonnaise in avocado. Oh, there you go. And he would take the middle out and put mayonnaise in that sucker and eat that thing. Mish it up. The next thing you know, you got guacamole. I can't even think about that. Yeah, he never mixed it, though. It was kind of lazy, I think, but he would just, like, put it like a thing of mayonnaise in there. But he was old, though, too. My dad was 70 when I was born. He was an old man. Wow. So he had that seniors. You had the same genes as I would have if my dad was like 35 when I was born? Well, interestingly, you get the same genetic code, but there are nuances of gene expression that change during a person's life that are passed on. In fact, you have changes in your gene expression that you've inherited from your grandparents. We've recently seen some studies that show significant changes in the offspring of male mice who've been exposed to nicotine. Jesus Christ. Yeah. How we live our lives, not only how we treat our kids, but they inherit a lot of stuff from us. If they'll smoke, they'll poke. That's what I used to hear, but if you're trying to meet girls, if you're trying to pick up girls at a bar or something, it's like, oh, the smoke, the girls that are smoking are usually down for some type of intercourse, but that's just an old, apparently, it pertains to mice, too. What else do we want to ask? Nick, do you have anything else? Let me just say, don't necessarily have a response for that, but I'm noodling it right now, gluten-free noodling in my mind. Were you saying the mice with nicotine had extra babies, is that what you said? No. What I said was that there were changes in DNA expression when mice were treated with nicotine that were passed on not only to their offspring, but to their offspring's offspring. Oh, wow. So your lifestyle choices are going to impact not only your kids, but your grandkids. Jesus. I want to apologize to my grandkids right now for anything that I've done. It really is. Gee, that's what we should leave out. The will should also have a huge disclaimer in it. By the way. Here's the poor choices I made. Here's the money for your rehab. Like a scar fact. Here's all the poor choices that I made. Scar fact. And you get them. I'm going to get the URL for that. There we go. Somebody probably already took that one. They probably did. Somebody probably just took it. Somebody's probably... I have one more question, and there's one more video question I think we should get to. Great. You mentioned the six to eight servings of fruit, and I'm wondering with the food pyramid, is that like some people have like a theory it's more nefarious where it's like all lobbies did that. They fought to get their food in there. So it's that. It's not just bad science that we've learned from. Well, it's bad science with all due respect that was put out by industry. And so what we learned published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in the late 60s and recently recapitulated in the New York Times front page was this incredibly powerful influence that the sugar industry had over what doctors would publish in medical journals. That's where all the bad, the idea that fat was bad came from. They wanted to castigate fat so that you would have to fill in your calories from sugar and carbs. And they manipulated the scientific data so that doctors bought into, they said, heck, it was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, meanwhile, we've now learned that in the late 60s, early 70s, those well respected researchers were paid off. And that killed hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people globally. Because when America adopted this fat phobia, yeah, I remember that around the world, everyone wanted to be like Americans. And they dropped their dietary fat. But not everybody. I mean, we saw places, for example, like France, where they continue to eat butter, they use a lot of olive oil, and their rates of cardiovascular disease are lower, rates of cancer are lower. And to this day, it remains that way, that people in various places like Europe, Italy as well, eat a lot of fat, you know, the Mediterranean diet that everybody's got. That's what I hear about a lot. So great. It's a diet that's high fat. You put olive oil on everything. We travel with olive oil. And I eat about a liter a week myself of olive oil. And the reason we travel with it is because when you go to a restaurant, most of the time, you say, can you bring me some olive oil? It isn't. Yeah. It's canola oil. Yeah, they give you canola. Isn't that the weirdest? You think I'm going to put this in my salad? If it's 51% olive oil, they're allowed to say it's olive oil. Like if it's 51% whole grain, they're allowed to say this is whole grain cereal, whole grain pasta, whole grain bread. Do you see those things starting to change? Are we going to? Because I feel, as much as, it's so funny, half the day I'll feel like, man, we're all fucked. We're all addicted to all these foods and all these things, and society's fucked. Then the other half of the day, I will think, you know what, there's such a rebirth of people learning right now through long form entertainment, like podcasting, instead of just short form quips that are advertisers supported, like on larger networks, right? That we're in an age of enlightenment kind of where if you want to be enlightened and you want to learn, you still have to take action physically, but if you want to, that it's there. So it's like, it's so crazy. The half the day I feel one way and half the day I feel the other. But isn't it wild that it's legal to have so many other things that are so addictive, but they're not really branded that way? Well, I choose to- You know what I'm saying, though? Oh, I absolutely do. And I don't like what I see around me, that's for sure. But I think it's better for me to light the single candle as opposed to cursing the darkness. I mean, truthfully, you read Grain Brain, there's a lot of cursing of the darkness that goes in there because I don't like what people do to manipulate you. And it's unfair. And making things addictive that you would never have suspected, online gambling, you know, all these things. Oh, yeah. I was at a casino this weekend and when I'm in there, it's when I thought about it. I was like, I can't believe, I mean, the casino must have made $15 million this weekend when I was at it. I was like, I just can't believe that this is legal because even though it's fun for a little bit and I get how the dopamine hits and stuff and it would seem like it just is not good for people overall. It isn't. And it keeps them locked in where we started our conversation today, keeps them locked into their reptilian amygdala brain of impulsivity and not thinking of consequences. People can be addicted to online shopping. You know people like that. Oh, pornography. I mean, I'm about 95 days off of pornography. Well, think about that. It appeals to you instantaneously and then there's a click. Just like to go on Amazon and buy something instantly, a drink and here you are. You haven't slept. You've traveled and you see Dunkin' Donuts. It's playing upon your susceptibility. You are so vulnerable at that moment and bingo, there they are and I know I shouldn't be eating this crap, but I do because it's there and the lights and all and everything. And so my... That's a dark arts. That's what we call the dark arts. And we always have is where you are being manipulated into doing something you don't really want to do or really excess that sort of thing. Well Theo, half the battle is calling it out. And so that's what our new book's about, is calling it out so you can suddenly realize these people are taking advantage of me. They are manipulating me. They're manipulating my eyeballs and my bank account for their advantage, not for you. So it's guised as looking like it's good for you. It'll help you, whatever, fill in the blank. And that's what I want. I want to lose weight. I want to have a more expensive car. I want a blank. They'll help you with clickbait. It's done. But in reality, it has nothing to do with you. It's all about them and their bottom line. And our mission is to call it out because as soon as you recognize it, then you bet. And suddenly you say, hey, I'm not giving into this, who's in charge? Is my reptilian brain in charge, saying I'm going to do it? What the heck? I have no control. Or did Theo finally say, uh-uh, not this time. I'm going to make the right decision. Yeah, because it's so funny. I like fruity pebbles. I haven't eaten them in years, but I like them. But what I like even more is not getting fucked over by somebody. So once I know, then it's like, okay, I would eat these, but even more so, I hate somebody tricking me or taking advantage. And now that you're aware of that, you can make a change. Let me, you bring up an interesting point, and that is fruity pebbles, uh, or anything else that's sweet. We love sweet. Do I love sweet sitting here talking to you? Heck yeah, would I love to eat sweet foods? Why? Because my brain and your brain and everybody else on the planet's brain is wired to like sweet because sweet told our ancestors two things. It told us that the food was safe and that the food was ripe and had the most nutrients. It also told us that there's three things, that winter is coming. When does fruit generally ripen, uh, you know, wild fruit, wild blueberries end of the summer, early fall, eat sugar. What does that do? Insulin rises. What does that do? Body fat. What does that do? Let's just survive in the wintertime where you don't have food. So our sweet tooth led to our ability to survive. Now that same mechanism is being exploited by every Dunkin Donuts, everybody that wants you to eat their fruity pebbles, whatever it is they're peeling to your sweet tooth, that's a dopamine hit that most people can't turn away from. Who knew? But you know now. That's the point. I know, I know, I know, but I just, I wish I didn't know. No, knowledge is key, you know? No, it is key. Even though I don't want it to be, it's like at a certain point in my life, I just have to make some choices that it's like, you know, I want to be able to live longer so that I can, you know, not only experience life, but also like be a part of good stuff and like, and learn more. And like, and this is it. It's like, I'm starting to see, you know, friends, I see friends, you know, I had a high school reunion a couple of years ago and I was like, damn, this dude's almost dead, you know? What? Daniel's almost dead. That dude looks 65 years old, you know, he's over there eating pay days and chilling out, you know? Like, you got to tighten up. Keith Barcy. Yeah. Here's what, Neko, here's what- Those are good. Yeah. Here's the good thing that's going on here is, here's a guy who, you, who, you're learning about life and you're doing the very best that you can. Right. You're talking to people, you're learning, but well beyond this being just about you, you're sharing this with the hundreds of thousands of people who are also having issues trying to understand what in the heck it's all about and empowering them with this knowledge then to make better decisions. You know, the word doctor doesn't mean healer, it means teacher. Right. It means giving out information. So you're doing a heck of a thing here. You really are. You're helping a lot of people. Well, thanks, man. That's nice of you to say. Yeah, we do a lot of stuff. I mean, and our listeners do a lot of stuff. I mean, they call in with real questions, you know, they're concerned. They, you know, I mean, I think we are in this age, I think I see it a lot through our podcast of people wanting to, you know, they don't want to be a victim anymore of, you know, corporations and of advertising and just starting to realize, you know, I think some of that is starting to come to an end in some ways. Yeah. And you know, Theo, what it does is it isolates people ultimately. They become just ends of one walking around on their own isolated, locked into their smartphone and not interacting. And we need everybody. We need you. We need everybody to reconnect to each other. So we're actually in the process of putting together a website called reconnect global dot com, where we're going to have essays from people who talk about this, how we can reconnect to our gut bacteria, how we can reconnect to the signaling of our genome, how we can reconnect to the prefrontal cortex and become more empathetic, how I can reconnect to people around me, to my neighbors, to my community, to other countries, though they may be different from us. That's cool. How we can connect to the planet. Yeah. Just to have some understanding, to want to be healthy, to operate at our fullest, because I believe that, yeah, at our core, we are, yeah, very good. We have to embrace diversity. You know, we talk about, of course, of the gut bacteria, the more diverse your gut bacteria, the more resilient your body is to dealing with the onslaught of stress of our modern world. But the more diverse our culture is, same thing. The more diverse we are as people, the more we're able to handle adversity. I had an interesting discussion. That's interesting. Yeah, I had this discussion with a guy who's involved in Amazon restoration and preserving the diversity of the flora and fauna in the Amazon, and we realized, we're saying the same thing. He's saying, we have to preserve the plants and animals because diversity is what's going to keep the Amazon alive. And I said, same thing with our microbiome, that we have to have diversity of bacteria to keep us healthy, and we have to have diversity of humans so that we can be resilient and survive. I see a lot of people, you know, doing sex everywhere I go. People are, you know, I don't even know what color people are anymore, you know? So it seems like there's definitely some good bit of diversity. The more I go around America, yeah, and I think, yeah, like I come from a culture where, you know, like my area was just kind of black and white, and times were a little different then, but now when I go back home, I feel like it's a lot different vibe. And, you know, I feel like most of America gets along pretty well. It seems like, I think they politicize that it's not a lot of places, and they amplify that. To me, it seems like on the news, but most of the places I go, it doesn't, it's not really the reality that I see and feel, you know? Well, we are programmed, hardwired, to really make a decision when we see somebody's eyes for the first time or their face for the first time, that instantaneous decision is friend or foe. Right? I could have met you. I could see that 100%. Instantaneously friend or foe. And we have these then, we color that decision based upon our life experiences, is that person friend or foe. And I had an interesting experience that I came off a plane, Dallas, Texas, and went down the escalator, and there was a woman wearing a burka, and it was right after a terrorist thing had happened. And as we all do, friend or foe, and my mind said, foe, step back, this person. And I realized that that's an impulse from my amygdala, it's an instantaneous impulse. I am absolutely going to override that impulse and recognize it for what it was and do my very best to override that and speak to people. And it's the same thing, yeah, like you're saying, it's adversity, it's like, same thing with making the choices that we put in our stomach, it's making the choices that we see in front of us, just taking a moment and trusting our instinct. When we prejudge, that's the definition of predjudice, it's where it comes from. And we prejudge based upon these engrams that are built up in our minds from early life experiences that to a significant place there by our parents and what their world was like. And when I grew up, the world was, we were not taught, but things were very polarized. If we have to do our very best to embrace diversity and just open up our hearts. And yeah, the amygdala is going to make a decision, we don't have to go with that decision. If the amygdala says, I'm going to reach out, I'm going to buy, I'm going to do this, I'm going to eat this, we take a step back, we bring online a higher level of thinking and we ask ourselves, is this an appropriate decision? Right. Am I being manipulated? Yeah, am I being manipulated, am I just lizarding? Probiotics, what is that? Because I started taking those, chewing those, the gummies and I like them, man. Well you like them, what do you mean you like them? I like them, I feel like they are good, I like having a little snack. So you could say, there you go, you could say I like them. The most I ever have was four. Okay, okay. You could say I like them from the amygdala, meaning I like them because they're sweet and I like that and I'm done. Yeah, the chewable ones. Or you could say, I like them because. That's what I want to know, why do I like them. Okay, so you like them because, you bring in your prefrontal cortex and you say, I like them because I now know that having probiotic organisms in my gut helps with diversity, helps with gut function, helps reduce inflammation and I'm buying into that science. Having said that, then probably the gummy part of the probiotic gummy would not be the way to go. So you're eating them because they're a little treat. You're not, but you know. I mean, I want to have probiotics and you know, I started thinking like, I got to make my stomach healthier, you know. So you want to get a good probiotic and there's some good brands that we can talk about, but you want to get one that has long shelf life, that gives you 30, 40, 50 billion organisms that has a lot of diversity of organisms, 10, 15 aquariums inside of me. More than that, yeah. So you really want to look for those factors and there are plenty of good products out there, but I think that's a very reasonable thing. And then be sure that you culture these guys as well as the ones that already live in there by having lots of prebiotics in your diet. And you can get some great probiotics from eating fermented foods like kimchi and sauerkraut and fermented vegetables. So you don't have to always buy a probiotic pill or in this case, gummy. You may want to pass on the gummies. I mean, I'm not trying to be brand specific here. I don't know. But like say if you're in a bind and you get in a tough spot, can some probiotic gummies help you out? Yeah, I don't know how bioavailable those probiotics are going to be. So you really, again, you want to look for certain parameters within that brands are going to satisfy, making sure you're really getting what you think you are. But understand that if you're eating the gummies, you're eating the gummy part, not the probiotic part, probably. Right. You think there's some probiotics in there? They have to put something. Who knows? Your Lottie doll. There's no oversight as far as that goes. Who looks at that and says, yeah, not only are they in there, generally, read the label. And often that's what they're going to say is 10 billion CFU, meaning colony forming units at the time of manufacture. Right. And if you see that, that's not the product for you. Right. You don't want something that when they manufactured it 18 months ago had this, now it's got nothing. And what that fresh hitter? You want to have something that says 30 billion CFUs guaranteed for 12 months after the date that is stamped on that product when it was manufactured. So you take it six months later, it's been on the store shelf you had at home. And now it's still going to kick your butt in terms of having good probiotics. And so eating better will leave me more to be my best self. There's really just no denying it, it seems like. It's a take home message, but it's all about taking that moment, bringing online your higher level of thinking about what's best for Theo and who's in charge. And what are my instincts, what are those that are in my stomach? So instincts are some things that are programmed. Sweet is an instinct. Sex is an instinct. Okay. Feast, flight against potentially threatening issue is an instinct. So we talk about. Trust your instincts, people say. Well, trust your instincts to some degree, but sometimes our instincts can get us into trouble. Everybody says something to you and you punch them in the face. Instinctually, well, they may have been talking to the guy standing behind you, right? Or they may have thought you were something, whatever. And so that's an instinctual response, an amygdala based sudden reaction that we need to temper. I think back, I mean, I'll never forget standing in line of all places at Best Buy. Oh yeah. No, it was Costco, it was Costco. And I had an instinctual response that I regret. And you could say what you want to me, I'm okay with that. But somebody said something to my wife and it didn't, luckily it could have been worse. And I have to say, I was very down on myself for not reining that in. I should have been the bigger person and reined it in and I didn't. But it's a lesson. So sometimes those instinctual responses can harm you. And instinctually, we should eat sugar all the time, because instinctually, we are told that it is good for us, it's telling us winter's coming and that the fruit is safe and ripe. That's, we override that with our hierarchical function telling us, no, we don't want to eat a lot of sugar. Instinctually everybody wants to have sex with everybody. And no matter what. And you know. You can't do it. You know, modern society, that's not necessarily going to be good for you. Oh, you can't even masturbate in your car anymore around here. They'll shut you down. There used to be a time I wasn't aware of that. So something happened in line and you got an altercation. Yeah, it could have been a lot worse. And anyway. But that was your instincts. It was my instinct. But I checked it right at the right moment. And I actually think a sensei, a teacher from years ago, martial arts teacher, who worked with me with that, that got me to the level and would, would kind of actually would hit me in the face until I, and would, and kept me from responding and would say, you want to hit me back? Come on, hit me back. And, and training me not to respond. And I got to that point and that engram was activated. And then I backed down. And I was very grateful for that training because it took me the edge. You know, it's funny because I had an experience. I was in, I think Berlin one time with a girlfriend, we were traveling and, and we're on this bike tour. You know, you go on bike tours when you're on a tour sometimes. And some guy was like going down a bike path really fast and he like hit my girlfriend's bike like really hard. And when I looked at him, I could tell immediately he'd like done it on purpose. We weren't really in the way. He had, maybe he got angry with tourists. He didn't like living in the city. Who knows? But my first instinct was to pedal off and fucking kill that guy, you know, get a knife out of an imaginary knife suddenly in my hand. Like I was going to fucking kill this dude, you know, but I didn't, right? I didn't do that. I just stayed there. You know, I made sure she was okay. But I've always regretted not, maybe not killing him, but at least driving over and jumping and just, you know, tackling him and at least. But think about it now from the perspective of the fact that you were able to reign yourself in. That is absolutely huge. Still makes me mad though. Think about it. That you could reign yourself in at that moment and not do, and you could reign in the amygdala and say, I'm not going to do it. And that should be a sense of pride that you have. But I felt like it was a wimp. I felt like a wimp though. No, you're not a wimp. You know that. You need that man to prove that you're a wimp or not a wimp. Who is he? I don't know. I'm going to have it for life. Hopefully dead, I wish, but, yeah, but I mean, yeah, I got to let it go. I guess I still have a resentment against that man. So I'm glad I'm thinking this out. It's good to feel it though. It's good to take yourself out of the moment and experience it. That was what that Deep Breath was just about, because you went back to that moment and it again challenged you, you know. Your adrenaline level is up, your cortisol levels up, fight or flight, which isn't necessarily good for you. But to let it go, to feel it, experience it. Take that purging breath, clearing breath, and move on. You're a better person for that. And the fact that you reigned it in then, that is huge. You pat yourself on the back for that one. Pat that dude on the back really hard with a knife. Anything else, Nick, that you have? Oh, yeah. So we have six doctors. Celebrity doctors. Right, Nick. Yeah, field this one out here. Yeah, we've got six celebrity doctors, and we'd like you to rank them just in your love for them, your respect for them, and for the people listening, we've got Deepak Chopra, Dr. Ken Jong, Dr. Drew, Dr. Oz, Che Guevara, and Dr. Phil. Who should we listen to, you know? Yeah. Well, to light the single candle and not, anyway, I... Fight the dark... I love Deepak. I've known Deepak for, I guess, 28 years. I dreamed about Deepak Chopra last night, oddly enough, and this morning I told my wife I dreamed about Deepak. We were having dinner, I think he's centered, I think he's one of the coolest individuals I know. Wow. So I love the guy. Number one? Well, let me continue, then we'll work on the ranking. Mehmed Oz, I think is fantastic. I'm a medical advisor to the Dr. Oz show, been on that program, I guess three or four times. I respect his desire to be a little bit out there, to challenge the mainstream, and to really apply a level of objectivity to things that are a little bit off-center, and I highly respect that. I know him as a person, and his wife, and his wife's parents. Is he a neat man? He's a cool guy. Wow. I like him a lot, and we actually just were with his mother and father-in-law two weeks ago in New York, and they're terrific people. Dr. Drew, super cool. I mean, here's the guy. Yeah, he is, I highly respect everything he's about. His inquisitive mind is breathtaking, his depth of knowledge, but depth of validation when he has an idea, I think is super cool. The other three, I don't know, who's top middle there? That's Dr. Ken John. I mean, he's now a comedian and comedic actor, but he was a comedian. Oh, that's right. He was a doctor. I only know him from the comedy perspective. Yeah. Apparently, the doctor wasn't going so good if he bailed out. Yeah, but apparently, this part is working out well. That's a good point. I've heard him on the comedy channel, or one of the Sears Radio channels. From that perspective, I respect his comedy. Che Guevara, I'm not sure. I think we're kind of in a different arena, and with all due respect, I think that Dr. Phil might be in a different arena, not being a medical doctor, but then again, things that both Deepak- What is he a doctor of? He was a bouncer. Wasn't he on the Oprah Show? Well, his show is all about psychology. Oh, that's right. So, both Deepak and Memedaz are MDs. Deepak was an endocrinologist, very well-credentialed, Memedaz practiced cardiovascular surgery, as you may know. So, my ability to relate to them based on my training, I think, is much greater. But clearly, they both are exploring areas that are not particularly in the field of medicine, but absolutely should be, like spirituality in the case of Deepak, and certainly Memed goes to that place as well. So, what can I say? We'll leave the answer at that. Who do you think sets you out of Dr. Oz and Dr. Drew? Who what? What kind of sex here, you think? Well, I don't know what kind of shape Dr. Oz is in. I think he's lean and mean. Dr. Drew dedicates himself to that. He's ripped. I don't know. I think Deepak is sexy, actually. I do, because Deepak does what he wants. He wears what he wants, and I think he's very attractive from the perspective of being artsy in that regard. And I find artsy to be very attractive. Dang. There you go. Deepak it is, man. Dr. Pearl Mudder, thank you so much for being here. It's been pleasure. I think it's been really, really interesting. It's been awesome for me. Thanks for you. I've got a year of dieting now to do. This is going to suck. A lifetime. Oh, shit. I'm just floating on the breeze, and I feel I'm falling like these leaves, I must be cornerstone. But when I reach that ground, I'll share this peace of mind. But it's going to take a little time for me to set that parking brake and let myself onward. Shine that light on me.

in a while thankfully those reduce\"},{\"currTime\":171,\"text\":\"my acuity each time and there is a risk that I can go totally blind and in my\"},{\"currTime\":176,\"text\":\"both of my eyes are one of them depending when you say acuity what does that\"},{\"currTime\":180,\"text\":\"mean I mean like what I can see how well I can see things so the clarity and the\"},{\"currTime\":187,\"text\":\"detail that I pick up for example if I say I have 22,000 what you can see at\"},{\"currTime\":192,\"text\":\"20 feet or rather what you can see at 2,000 feet I can see at 20 feet so you\"},{\"currTime\":199,\"text\":\"know you let's say you have better distance vision the clarity of your\"},{\"currTime\":204,\"text\":\"vision is a lot more detailed and all-encompassing so your field is a lot\"},{\"currTime\":210,\"text\":\"wider than mine mine is tunnel vision which means my field is 10 degrees okay so a\"},{\"currTime\":217,\"text\":\"lot of times like I hear about people that are colorblind and to me that seems\"},{\"currTime\":221,\"text\":\"like honestly like kind of a bunch of bullshit do you feel like that I mean I\"},{\"currTime\":225,\"text\":\"think colorblind is definitely a thing there are people that are born color\"},{\"currTime\":228,\"text\":\"blind where their hues are like gray black and white and that's all they can\"},{\"currTime\":232,\"text\":\"really see they have different monochrome tones of but to call it colorblind like\"},{\"currTime\":237,\"text\":\"I feel like it should be like I do you ever feel like yeah let's call it call\"},{\"currTime\":242,\"text\":\"like let's call it like hey kind of confused you know like let's don't go\"},{\"currTime\":246,\"text\":\"all the way to blind like blind seems like almost something that should be a\"},{\"currTime\":252,\"text\":\"little bit more reserved for people that actually can't really see that well do\"},{\"currTime\":257,\"text\":\"you guys is there any vibe like that in the in the blind community where there's\"},{\"currTime\":261,\"text\":\"like kind of like you know like darkness beef with like people that are\"},{\"currTime\":266,\"text\":\"colorblind or anything like that in terms of that not that I've noticed but people\"},{\"currTime\":271,\"text\":\"do get upset over the terms visually impaired versus totally blind some\"},{\"currTime\":275,\"text\":\"people like to say that they have a visual impairment or their low vision\"},{\"currTime\":279,\"text\":\"depending on what their acuity is and how much whether or not they can read\"},{\"currTime\":283,\"text\":\"print so for example someone that can see traffic lights outside in the daytime\"},{\"currTime\":287,\"text\":\"they can read signs they can read print and navigate maybe with minimal use of\"},{\"currTime\":291,\"text\":\"a cane they call them high high partials and then there are people who are\"},{\"currTime\":296,\"text\":\"totally blind or who are lights who have some light perception and we we do like\"},{\"currTime\":303,\"text\":\"to categorize ourselves some of us in in those various categories but then\"},{\"currTime\":307,\"text\":\"there are a lot of people for the sake of the public who just say even if\"},{\"currTime\":310,\"text\":\"they're not totally blind I'm blind and just call it a day because that would be\"},{\"currTime\":315,\"text\":\"me really confused yeah yeah because I don't want to be a high parcel that\"},{\"currTime\":319,\"text\":\"sounds like somebody that's trying to be fancy to me like I would I know it's\"},{\"currTime\":323,\"text\":\"us yeah I'm out okay I'm a high partial I don't associate with you go away yeah\"},{\"currTime\":329,\"text\":\"high partial sounds like somebody that's like in one of those like that movie with\"},{\"currTime\":332,\"text\":\"Katniss Everdeen you know oh yes I'm a high partial put me near the\"},{\"currTime\":336,\"text\":\"cornucopia first yeah the best weapons yeah sounds like because there's a lot\"},{\"currTime\":342,\"text\":\"of high parcels even just in regular do what especially in Hollywood this place\"},{\"currTime\":346,\"text\":\"is full of high parcels man oh man Jesus it's really that's a little bit\"},{\"currTime\":351,\"text\":\"creepy almost out here so do you like so if I reach across the table right now\"},{\"currTime\":356,\"text\":\"and touch your hand like if you put your hand out right mm-hmm okay can you tell\"},{\"currTime\":361,\"text\":\"by like touching my hand like like how old you feel like I am or do you that's\"},{\"currTime\":366,\"text\":\"an interesting question I've actually never got that um well cuz I could\"},{\"currTime\":370,\"text\":\"imagine your senses are better than mine or this is my perception is that your\"},{\"currTime\":373,\"text\":\"senses are way better than mine so so I'm thinking like you know do you is your\"},{\"currTime\":378,\"text\":\"sense of touch like at a level that I could couldn't even imagine you know\"},{\"currTime\":382,\"text\":\"um so I would say that it's all in how much you use it I think anyone is\"},{\"currTime\":388,\"text\":\"capable of developing sense of touch more or hearing vision etc so you focus\"},{\"currTime\":395,\"text\":\"mainly on what you see around you and maybe don't focus as much on audio cues\"},{\"currTime\":399,\"text\":\"because you don't need them as much you can you can see what's around you and\"},{\"currTime\":403,\"text\":\"that sense compensates for the others that is your primary sense for me I would\"},{\"currTime\":407,\"text\":\"say mainly my hearing is my primary and of course I read Braille so I use touch\"},{\"currTime\":412,\"text\":\"for that but what's interesting is I would say my sense of touch in my index\"},{\"currTime\":416,\"text\":\"fingers is better than my sense of touch in my other fingers because I use that\"},{\"currTime\":421,\"text\":\"for Braille and I've developed that sensitivity in those fingers so do you\"},{\"currTime\":425,\"text\":\"learn something then about like almost do you feel like so then with that being\"},{\"currTime\":430,\"text\":\"said like say your sense of touch in your index fingers is much more cute\"},{\"currTime\":435,\"text\":\"because you use it for Braille use that's your main fingers used for Braille\"},{\"currTime\":438,\"text\":\"right I would say so do you then do you think that this could be possible that\"},{\"currTime\":442,\"text\":\"if somebody used their shoulder for Braille for long enough yeah they would\"},{\"currTime\":448,\"text\":\"be able to develop a sense of how to read even or their toes there are there\"},{\"currTime\":452,\"text\":\"are folks that like I've seen oh toe-offs you're talking about people that are\"},{\"currTime\":456,\"text\":\"just towing off or they use their toes to read yeah that's like a guy like a\"},{\"currTime\":463,\"text\":\"guy like that sounds like a line a guy would use on a girl you know like hey I\"},{\"currTime\":466,\"text\":\"can use my toes to read oh yeah like a pickup line at a bar let me read your\"},{\"currTime\":472,\"text\":\"shirt I can use my toes you know yeah I mean they do make Braille shirts right\"},{\"currTime\":478,\"text\":\"and it says don't read me or don't touch me or something in Braille they have a\"},{\"currTime\":486,\"text\":\"bumper sticker I know that says you're driving too close and it's in Braille\"},{\"currTime\":490,\"text\":\"and it's on like nice which makes sense really I'd love to see that yeah if you're\"},{\"currTime\":494,\"text\":\"that close yeah I think you got a back off you got a problem you're gonna get\"},{\"currTime\":497,\"text\":\"run over yeah but so so you feel like for you your sense of hearing is really\"},{\"currTime\":503,\"text\":\"acute I would say I've developed it more so and I pay attention to my newt sounds\"},{\"currTime\":509,\"text\":\"whereas that kind of goes both ways because in dance music my boyfriend loves\"},{\"currTime\":514,\"text\":\"to put up the music really loud because it you know it's sometimes like\"},{\"currTime\":519,\"text\":\"especially working out or something so there are in dance music high-pitched\"},{\"currTime\":523,\"text\":\"buzzy noises that almost sound like a like an electric chair you know and it's\"},{\"currTime\":529,\"text\":\"painful like the louder it is the painful it is and I just have this like\"},{\"currTime\":532,\"text\":\"instinctual ah you know recoil reaction put my hands over my ears no anything\"},{\"currTime\":539,\"text\":\"is the funniest thing ever who makes some of the most painful music out there\"},{\"currTime\":542,\"text\":\"because obviously you have very acute senses there is a German band that I've\"},{\"currTime\":547,\"text\":\"heard I think it's called Republic one or something oh yeah and it is I I'm just\"},{\"currTime\":552,\"text\":\"I sit there I'm like no what about an American artist maybe I mean that\"},{\"currTime\":559,\"text\":\"makes them really really you know just some real junk like I mean I'm thinking\"},{\"currTime\":564,\"text\":\"for me it's Nicki Minaj oh yeah some of her songs are interesting that I could\"},{\"currTime\":569,\"text\":\"see that but is there a band or something that kind of you're like hmm I\"},{\"currTime\":575,\"text\":\"would say probably some of the death metal bands like I and I used to love\"},{\"currTime\":582,\"text\":\"death metal so I'm not trying to rag on them here but um cannibal corpse oh yeah\"},{\"currTime\":587,\"text\":\"that example they got some it's just painful high notes and in the solos and\"},{\"currTime\":594,\"text\":\"they don't want you to live through the songs it sounds like no they want you\"},{\"currTime\":597,\"text\":\"to become a cannibal corpse yeah they have ulterior it sounds like they have\"},{\"currTime\":600,\"text\":\"really ulterior motives yeah I think so is there it's just so interesting so it\"},{\"currTime\":606,\"text\":\"almost it seems so to your sense of hearing to me would almost be like\"},{\"currTime\":610,\"text\":\"almost it seemed like a superpower almost a little bit I don't know I mean if I\"},{\"currTime\":616,\"text\":\"were daredevil and had a weapon in my cane that'd be awesome but yeah yeah no\"},{\"currTime\":619,\"text\":\"I wouldn't I wouldn't say it's it's that good but it does certainly help in\"},{\"currTime\":624,\"text\":\"picking up cues and what's going on in the environment around me so\"},{\"currTime\":629,\"text\":\"especially for navigation I use my sense of hearing let's say there's a\"},{\"currTime\":633,\"text\":\"waterfall that I know I'll have to pass or keep behind me as I'm traveling\"},{\"currTime\":638,\"text\":\"forward and then there's an ice cream parlor and they play particular music\"},{\"currTime\":642,\"text\":\"and there are smells associated all of that not only triggers memory to help\"},{\"currTime\":647,\"text\":\"you like sort of map it out in your head but it gives you a constant that you\"},{\"currTime\":652,\"text\":\"can rely on as your as you're traveling or even when you're watching films\"},{\"currTime\":656,\"text\":\"without audio description do you feel like a detective a little bit then like\"},{\"currTime\":659,\"text\":\"when every day when you wake up do you feel like almost like Inspector Gadget a\"},{\"currTime\":663,\"text\":\"little because you got a kind of like that would be cool hey maybe I'll make my\"},{\"currTime\":667,\"text\":\"mornings a little easier especially when the week drags on and I just want the\"},{\"currTime\":672,\"text\":\"weekend to be there so I can enjoy and record and have fun thinning thing yeah\"},{\"currTime\":676,\"text\":\"yeah I'll try that that's a good suggestion but do you feel like like I'm\"},{\"currTime\":680,\"text\":\"just trying to think of what it's like to not like you know to be to not have\"},{\"currTime\":684,\"text\":\"sight to be blonde to be sight impaired like I'm trying to think of like if my\"},{\"currTime\":689,\"text\":\"brain would wake up every day and ever in the world would seem like more vibrant\"},{\"currTime\":694,\"text\":\"yeah is that what it seems like it can certainly especially if you're looking\"},{\"currTime\":700,\"text\":\"forward to the day and you're in a in a great mood it can definitely seem filled\"},{\"currTime\":706,\"text\":\"with with a lot of different things it can get a little overwhelming sometimes\"},{\"currTime\":711,\"text\":\"not having sight you mean yeah if you're in a loud environment for example oh\"},{\"currTime\":716,\"text\":\"yeah like being at a bar or a club even at a convention or right like a\"},{\"currTime\":722,\"text\":\"Chelsea handler yeah concert yeah yeah yeah sorry just some of slips out of me but um so\"},{\"currTime\":731,\"text\":\"so places like that because why there's too much going on there's too much and\"},{\"currTime\":735,\"text\":\"sometimes what I do what helps in those situations because it's hard to navigate\"},{\"currTime\":739,\"text\":\"if first of all if there's flashing lights like at a carnival loud music loud a\"},{\"currTime\":744,\"text\":\"lot of people talking it's hard to orient yourself so what I'll do is I'll like if\"},{\"currTime\":749,\"text\":\"I'm standing somewhere waiting to navigate I will put my hand on something\"},{\"currTime\":753,\"text\":\"that doesn't move some solid object like a chair or table and just stand there and\"},{\"currTime\":758,\"text\":\"kind of listen and try to figure out where stuff is or if possible navigate\"},{\"currTime\":763,\"text\":\"when the environment is quiet map it out for myself and then it's not so you know\"},{\"currTime\":768,\"text\":\"crazy yeah but the dog actually my dog here Naboo\"},{\"currTime\":772,\"text\":\"Naboo yeah very good at navigating outside so if I'm a loud restaurant which\"},{\"currTime\":777,\"text\":\"happens a lot you know loud music I'll just say okay

different intuition from say like a\"},{\"currTime\":929,\"text\":\"snake or a frog do you feel like they have I'm just trying to think of actually\"},{\"currTime\":934,\"text\":\"snakes kind of freak me out I used to like them as a kid they but then when\"},{\"currTime\":939,\"text\":\"they start wrapping around you the more you know about them and how easy it is\"},{\"currTime\":942,\"text\":\"for them to just choke you to death the scarier they are and more intimidating\"},{\"currTime\":946,\"text\":\"I think reptiles are hard to read some people have a

this kid named Doug Huval that I went to school with and I was in second\"},{\"currTime\":1005,\"text\":\"grade and he had a stutter and it was the most fascinating thing like I had\"},{\"currTime\":1011,\"text\":\"ever heard like because everybody I'd heard talk the same like everybody just\"},{\"currTime\":1016,\"text\":\"talked you know oh yeah and so when he suddenly had like this voice that was like\"},{\"currTime\":1020,\"text\":\"it was he was like a like he was like a like like an instrument a little more you\"},{\"currTime\":1024,\"text\":\"know it was just so it was unique and I was like oh man this is the best and I\"},{\"currTime\":1028,\"text\":\"remember I started impersonating him hmm and then the teacher at school

at\"},{\"currTime\":1354,\"text\":\"environments and things like that spells all of those have sounds related to them\"},{\"currTime\":1360,\"text\":\"I see so by adding in sound packs you're able to get like a more of an\"},{\"currTime\":1365,\"text\":\"experience where you can actually enjoy a multi sensory like a video game\"},{\"currTime\":1370,\"text\":\"experience now so with virtual reality kind of looming does that seem very\"},{\"currTime\":1375,\"text\":\"exciting to like yes the blind community oh yes deep-end games actually produced\"},{\"currTime\":1381,\"text\":\"one called

hey guys you're awesome like\"},{\"currTime\":1401,\"text\":\"how do I play this they're just like oh we we believe it's accessible let us\"},{\"currTime\":1406,\"text\":\"know you know so I've got to get my nephew to help me out here and what's\"},{\"currTime\":1409,\"text\":\"it called again I'm gonna write that down perception perception it sounds\"},{\"currTime\":1412,\"text\":\"really really interesting oh yeah oh yeah the trailers are amazing and the\"},{\"currTime\":1416,\"text\":\"voice acting is spot-on and so when you're listening to these types of things\"},{\"currTime\":1420,\"text\":\"mean you get everything from sound right I mean you're not able to yes and then\"},{\"currTime\":1424,\"text\":\"you have like some kind of extra I believe it's

that's all that would additionally help you\"},{\"currTime\":1439,\"text\":\"navigate and they're also iOS virtual reality games out there and you're you\"},{\"currTime\":1445,\"text\":\"able like so a virtual reality game like for me I would take the head the video\"},{\"currTime\":1450,\"text\":\"the video the visual set like the goggles and put them over my head my\"},{\"currTime\":1455,\"text\":\"over my eyes and then you know I would have the headphones on I would listen\"},{\"currTime\":1460,\"text\":\"to the experience but I'll also be able to see it for

for\"},{\"currTime\":2953,\"text\":\"example I just saw the haunted that the series on Netflix have you seen it no I\"},{\"currTime\":2958,\"text\":\"have no it's scary yes a little too real and so horror films I just thought of\"},{\"currTime\":2963,\"text\":\"this because they have so many more sound cues they do they do and the sound\"},{\"currTime\":2968,\"text\":\"design is amazing yeah cuz it's yeah it's it's trying to build up in emotion\"},{\"currTime\":2973,\"text\":\"whereas a lot of other things aren't really doing that they're just kind of\"},{\"currTime\":2975,\"text\":\"telling true story like point blank yeah like bird box for example with\"},{\"currTime\":2980,\"text\":\"Sandra Bullock yeah super amazing sound design with the sat with the

pretty\"},{\"currTime\":3015,\"text\":\"good I think they could have done I mean this is 70s but yeah I think they\"},{\"currTime\":3018,\"text\":\"should have made it stereo versus mono where it's like coming out of just one\"},{\"currTime\":3022,\"text\":\"channel in the center and then the music is stereo yeah it could have been but you\"},{\"currTime\":3026,\"text\":\"know for what it was at the time it was really good yeah yeah oh I'd love to see\"},{\"currTime\":3031,\"text\":\"I wonder how interesting it would be if you design this like help design the\"},{\"currTime\":3036,\"text\":\"sound for a horror film I bet that would be fascinating awesome do you feel like\"},{\"currTime\":3040,\"text\":\"we use the skills because that's such a unique skill that you like a sensory\"},{\"currTime\":3045,\"text\":\"ability to connect to a sound at a level that I couldn't do yeah you know\"},{\"currTime\":3051,\"text\":\"because yours your senses in that space are more cute I wouldn't want to make it\"},{\"currTime\":3055,\"text\":\"5.1 surround like most movies are anyway where it surrounds you like the you\"},{\"currTime\":3060,\"text\":\"wouldn't want to I would I would want to yes and I would want to make the so you\"},{\"currTime\":3066,\"text\":\"know how when people are on camera the actors unlike audio drama they are in\"},{\"currTime\":3071,\"text\":\"the center unless they're coming on to set from another room that's when you\"},{\"currTime\":3076,\"text\":\"would hear them off to the side but otherwise they're coming from the center\"},{\"currTime\":3080,\"text\":\"so both channels directly boom in front of you because the camera's focusing on\"},{\"currTime\":3084,\"text\":\"them what I would want to do is create like a virtual reality horror movie\"},{\"currTime\":3089,\"text\":\"where you walk through like a fly on the wall and you get to hear these things\"},{\"currTime\":3094,\"text\":\"happening and the people move around you in space like 5.1 surround sound\"},{\"currTime\":3098,\"text\":\"because that would make it more real especially if things were happening to\"},{\"currTime\":3102,\"text\":\"you and if you can make it like a 4d sensory experience where not only do\"},{\"currTime\":3107,\"text\":\"you have the movie and the

to use along with the movie like like let's say you have to kill the\"},{\"currTime\":3125,\"text\":\"killer so you'd be given a prop gun oh wow something like that would be a\"},{\"currTime\":3129,\"text\":\"you actually feel and you and have yeah yeah huh that would draw so many audiences I think just maybe\"},{\"currTime\":3137,\"text\":\"you're talking like 5d I mean maybe one you need another d go all out yeah it's\"},{\"currTime\":3143,\"text\":\"just so yeah it's like well I wonder do down do people does Hollywood come and\"},{\"currTime\":3147,\"text\":\"tap into the blonde community to learn more about sound or their groups that\"},{\"currTime\":3151,\"text\":\"do that it seems like it would be almost like a goldmine or they would that you\"},{\"currTime\":3156,\"text\":\"know they would go to a mine that has the value in it is there any like\"},{\"currTime\":3161,\"text\":\"connection to my knowledge no but I do know that they have experts and\"},{\"currTime\":3167,\"text\":\"consultants that they go to for example for the movie bird box I know they went\"},{\"currTime\":3171,\"text\":\"to a couple of people who are blind to

them on we have a couple more we\"},{\"currTime\":4348,\"text\":\"have a couple that are okay we had a we had a ton actually we got we procured a\"},{\"currTime\":4352,\"text\":\"couple so one thing that sighted people could do in my opinion that would help\"},{\"currTime\":4358,\"text\":\"is if they could just let us know what specifically makes them uncomfortable in\"},{\"currTime\":4365,\"text\":\"in situations and what we could do better to to sort of put them at ease\"},{\"currTime\":4369,\"text\":\"that would be helpful for us because then it wouldn't be all on us to try\"},{\"currTime\":4373,\"text\":\"figure out how to how to make people comfortable but then also if we should\"},{\"currTime\":4379,\"text\":\"get better about asking for help I think if we need it but then I guess sighted\"},{\"currTime\":4385,\"text\":\"people should trust us to know what we need and when we need help and just to\"},{\"currTime\":4390,\"text\":\"let them know what it is and also don't be afraid to ask questions that's one of\"},{\"currTime\":4394,\"text\":\"the things a lot of people aren't comfortable with which I get I mean I\"},{\"currTime\":4399,\"text\":\"would feel the same way I don't know much about mobility issues so if I were\"},{\"currTime\":4405,\"text\":\"talking to someone with mobility issues I would feel like I'm gonna offend them I\"},{\"currTime\":4410,\"text\":\"don't want to ask anything that's rude or ignorant and it's hard because you're\"},{\"currTime\":4413,\"text\":\"making yourself

like\"},{\"currTime\":4459,\"text\":\"in the times that we're in right now or like not the times but as the times that\"},{\"currTime\":4463,\"text\":\"like the media likes to make it feel like we're

comfortable asking questions that can\"},{\"currTime\":4477,\"text\":\"actually be helpful do you notice any of that like people are more worried about\"},{\"currTime\":4481,\"text\":\"offending you than they are about engaging with you all the time it's just\"},{\"currTime\":4484,\"text\":\"easier not to engage than risk offending someone and getting sued right\"},{\"currTime\":4488,\"text\":\"everyone's afraid of getting sued and that must come down a tougher in even\"},{\"currTime\":4493,\"text\":\"in your community because or not in that in this lawsuit way but just or maybe\"},{\"currTime\":4497,\"text\":\"so but also just that you know you need more communication yes I think\"},{\"currTime\":4503,\"text\":\"communication for us is key because we may not be able to tell body language or\"},{\"currTime\":4507,\"text\":\"eye contact whether the person is interested in communicating with us or\"},{\"currTime\":4510,\"text\":\"interacting so just talking and literally talking everything out yeah which\"},{\"currTime\":4516,\"text\":\"doesn't sound intuitive at all because you guys are

        "transcript_text": " today's guest is a she's blind man I'm gonna be honest with you if you think she's not blind you're nuts so today's guest is is a woman who's she's like kind of like the Amelia kind of sight heart kind of she's just that pioneer you know she's that she's that peeping bad girl so she is oh man I don't want talking about but she also is a voiceover actress she is a teacher she works with people who have suffered from the same thing she suffers from today's guest is blind and I've always wanted to meet somebody that's blind and sit down with them and so I'm really grateful already ladies and gentlemen the talented and lovely Tanya Milojevich I'm just sitting up here right now time I'm not drinking some water yeah to drink some water kind of has some notes but I'm not really looking at them and is it fun for you and people like kind of described to you what they're doing around you or do you feel like it's helpful sometimes I can tell by audio cues so for example I could hear you opening your water bottle and taking a swig so but yeah especially sometimes if I can't tell by someone's tone I'll ask are you this or that or did I interpret this correctly but you know once in a while usually people's voices are expressive so I can tell hmm and so you are a hundred percent blind like you've always been blind actually I have retinopathy of prematurity so I was born sighted it was just that I was premature two months and had to sit in the incubator for a couple months and then the oxygen extra oxygen detached my retinas so I'd have some surgeries to reattach and I was very lucky to be able to come to the US from Serbia where's from and have those reattached somewhat here in the US here in the US yeah dr. Ossie like how blind are you though like if I had to guess like like do you feel pretty blind oh total I mean it I have enough vision to get me into trouble but it's about 22,000 in one eye and 2700 in the other so every time I have a laser surgery because I developed glaucoma due to the scar tissue after my surgeries initially the laser surgeries that I do or did every couple of years haven't done one in a while thankfully those reduce my acuity each time and there is a risk that I can go totally blind and in my both of my eyes are one of them depending when you say acuity what does that mean I mean like what I can see how well I can see things so the clarity and the detail that I pick up for example if I say I have 22,000 what you can see at 20 feet or rather what you can see at 2,000 feet I can see at 20 feet so you know you let's say you have better distance vision the clarity of your vision is a lot more detailed and all-encompassing so your field is a lot wider than mine mine is tunnel vision which means my field is 10 degrees okay so a lot of times like I hear about people that are colorblind and to me that seems like honestly like kind of a bunch of bullshit do you feel like that I mean I think colorblind is definitely a thing there are people that are born color blind where their hues are like gray black and white and that's all they can really see they have different monochrome tones of but to call it colorblind like I feel like it should be like I do you ever feel like yeah let's call it call like let's call it like hey kind of confused you know like let's don't go all the way to blind like blind seems like almost something that should be a little bit more reserved for people that actually can't really see that well do you guys is there any vibe like that in the in the blind community where there's like kind of like you know like darkness beef with like people that are colorblind or anything like that in terms of that not that I've noticed but people do get upset over the terms visually impaired versus totally blind some people like to say that they have a visual impairment or their low vision depending on what their acuity is and how much whether or not they can read print so for example someone that can see traffic lights outside in the daytime they can read signs they can read print and navigate maybe with minimal use of a cane they call them high high partials and then there are people who are totally blind or who are lights who have some light perception and we we do like to categorize ourselves some of us in in those various categories but then there are a lot of people for the sake of the public who just say even if they're not totally blind I'm blind and just call it a day because that would be me really confused yeah yeah because I don't want to be a high parcel that sounds like somebody that's trying to be fancy to me like I would I know it's us yeah I'm out okay I'm a high partial I don't associate with you go away yeah high partial sounds like somebody that's like in one of those like that movie with Katniss Everdeen you know oh yes I'm a high partial put me near the cornucopia first yeah the best weapons yeah sounds like because there's a lot of high parcels even just in regular do what especially in Hollywood this place is full of high parcels man oh man Jesus it's really that's a little bit creepy almost out here so do you like so if I reach across the table right now and touch your hand like if you put your hand out right mm-hmm okay can you tell by like touching my hand like like how old you feel like I am or do you that's an interesting question I've actually never got that um well cuz I could imagine your senses are better than mine or this is my perception is that your senses are way better than mine so so I'm thinking like you know do you is your sense of touch like at a level that I could couldn't even imagine you know um so I would say that it's all in how much you use it I think anyone is capable of developing sense of touch more or hearing vision etc so you focus mainly on what you see around you and maybe don't focus as much on audio cues because you don't need them as much you can you can see what's around you and that sense compensates for the others that is your primary sense for me I would say mainly my hearing is my primary and of course I read Braille so I use touch for that but what's interesting is I would say my sense of touch in my index fingers is better than my sense of touch in my other fingers because I use that for Braille and I've developed that sensitivity in those fingers so do you learn something then about like almost do you feel like so then with that being said like say your sense of touch in your index fingers is much more cute because you use it for Braille use that's your main fingers used for Braille right I would say so do you then do you think that this could be possible that if somebody used their shoulder for Braille for long enough yeah they would be able to develop a sense of how to read even or their toes there are there are folks that like I've seen oh toe-offs you're talking about people that are just towing off or they use their toes to read yeah that's like a guy like a guy like that sounds like a line a guy would use on a girl you know like hey I can use my toes to read oh yeah like a pickup line at a bar let me read your shirt I can use my toes you know yeah I mean they do make Braille shirts right and it says don't read me or don't touch me or something in Braille they have a bumper sticker I know that says you're driving too close and it's in Braille and it's on like nice which makes sense really I'd love to see that yeah if you're that close yeah I think you got a back off you got a problem you're gonna get run over yeah but so so you feel like for you your sense of hearing is really acute I would say I've developed it more so and I pay attention to my newt sounds whereas that kind of goes both ways because in dance music my boyfriend loves to put up the music really loud because it you know it's sometimes like especially working out or something so there are in dance music high-pitched buzzy noises that almost sound like a like an electric chair you know and it's painful like the louder it is the painful it is and I just have this like instinctual ah you know recoil reaction put my hands over my ears no anything is the funniest thing ever who makes some of the most painful music out there because obviously you have very acute senses there is a German band that I've heard I think it's called Republic one or something oh yeah and it is I I'm just I sit there I'm like no what about an American artist maybe I mean that makes them really really you know just some real junk like I mean I'm thinking for me it's Nicki Minaj oh yeah some of her songs are interesting that I could see that but is there a band or something that kind of you're like hmm I would say probably some of the death metal bands like I and I used to love death metal so I'm not trying to rag on them here but um cannibal corpse oh yeah that example they got some it's just painful high notes and in the solos and they don't want you to live through the songs it sounds like no they want you to become a cannibal corpse yeah they have ulterior it sounds like they have really ulterior motives yeah I think so is there it's just so interesting so it almost it seems so to your sense of hearing to me would almost be like almost it seemed like a superpower almost a little bit I don't know I mean if I were daredevil and had a weapon in my cane that'd be awesome but yeah yeah no I wouldn't I wouldn't say it's it's that good but it does certainly help in picking up cues and what's going on in the environment around me so especially for navigation I use my sense of hearing let's say there's a waterfall that I know I'll have to pass or keep behind me as I'm traveling forward and then there's an ice cream parlor and they play particular music and there are smells associated all of that not only triggers memory to help you like sort of map it out in your head but it gives you a constant that you can rely on as your as you're traveling or even when you're watching films without audio description do you feel like a detective a little bit then like when every day when you wake up do you feel like almost like Inspector Gadget a little because you got a kind of like that would be cool hey maybe I'll make my mornings a little easier especially when the week drags on and I just want the weekend to be there so I can enjoy and record and have fun thinning thing yeah yeah I'll try that that's a good suggestion but do you feel like like I'm just trying to think of what it's like to not like you know to be to not have sight to be blonde to be sight impaired like I'm trying to think of like if my brain would wake up every day and ever in the world would seem like more vibrant yeah is that what it seems like it can certainly especially if you're looking forward to the day and you're in a in a great mood it can definitely seem filled with with a lot of different things it can get a little overwhelming sometimes not having sight you mean yeah if you're in a loud environment for example oh yeah like being at a bar or a club even at a convention or right like a Chelsea handler yeah concert yeah yeah yeah sorry just some of slips out of me but um so so places like that because why there's too much going on there's too much and sometimes what I do what helps in those situations because it's hard to navigate if first of all if there's flashing lights like at a carnival loud music loud a lot of people talking it's hard to orient yourself so what I'll do is I'll like if I'm standing somewhere waiting to navigate I will put my hand on something that doesn't move some solid object like a chair or table and just stand there and kind of listen and try to figure out where stuff is or if possible navigate when the environment is quiet map it out for myself and then it's not so you know crazy yeah but the dog actually my dog here Naboo Naboo yeah very good at navigating outside so if I'm a loud restaurant which happens a lot you know loud music I'll just say okay Naboo outside outside find the door find the door come on come on come on do you want a treat let's go and she finds the door and she helps you leave mm-hmm and she's very beautiful oh thank you and she also I noticed that she has very beautiful eyes yeah she wears makeup for me she has not real makeup but she's got markings around her eyes and it looks like eyeliner that's what I've been told it's so funny when you when I met her a few minutes ago when you introduced me the first thing I noticed about her I never noticed about I mean I've seen some animals with pretty eyes and stuff before they got smooshy the cat has some beautiful eyes he has an Instagram page but but she has beautiful eyes like you it's almost at first I was like holy smokes like today did you guys swap eyes or something like cuz she's got some like it's just crazy it's almost like that you were carting around a real set of freaking peepers right there on on on Naboo do some animals do you get a different sense from certain animals and other animals I'm just wondering like if you can get different senses than I can from from animals do you mean like bonding type or yeah their intentions yeah do some animals feel to you like like what does a dog seem like to you oh they're very lovey usually they pick up on our emotions in our body language as well as facial expressions really well hmm and the body positioning like where their tail is low is positioned or how how they're laying sometimes or even the enthusiasm of how they greet us those can tell us a lot about how they're feeling and I find myself talking to her like she's a real person you know all the time because she's with me everywhere I go so that's so interesting and now what about a cat do you have the same interactions with a cat I used to have a cat when I was a kid and I had a very you know solid bond with her she was an outdoor cat and she would sleep on my in bed with me sometimes or I used to carry her by her neck I guess as a kid my mom told me oh yeah which is not the right way to carry a cat but she never cared like she was so sweet and chill she didn't was she alive it sounds like I know right if you're a little bit of just didn't care but animals got along with me just fine do you get a different vibes like can you get a different intuition from say like a snake or a frog do you feel like they have I'm just trying to think of actually snakes kind of freak me out I used to like them as a kid they but then when they start wrapping around you the more you know about them and how easy it is for them to just choke you to death the scarier they are and more intimidating I think reptiles are hard to read some people have a knack for it me personally nope I have no idea I just always feel like I could be in danger of getting I don't know squeezed to death any moment right there's no ability to kind of know what they're thinking no feeling not with reptiles for me that's so interesting yeah yeah I can't read them they're so cold and detached and it's all about what they want but a cat also I feel now that I'm adult they're okay I'll pet them but yeah I don't trust them very much I'm more of a dog person yeah no I agree I saw two cats the other day sharing a cigarette outside of my building I was just gonna say I knew they were up to no good you know yeah and yeah thank you I think I'm just like I was thinking about this last night I was like when I was young one of my favorite the one of the first people I ever remember meeting was this kid named Doug Huval that I went to school with and I was in second grade and he had a stutter and it was the most fascinating thing like I had ever heard like because everybody I'd heard talk the same like everybody just talked you know oh yeah and so when he suddenly had like this voice that was like it was he was like a like he was like a like like an instrument a little more you know it was just so it was unique and I was like oh man this is the best and I remember I started impersonating him hmm and then the teacher at school thought that I was making fun of him right but I wasn't I just wanted I wanted to be like different kind of like he was you know I wanted to be I don't know I just yeah well it just seems so unique to me and so I think then I've always just had like this just this affinity for what it would be like to have something unique like no vision or or a unique like you know like they have a guy sometimes you see on the internet who doesn't have any arms and legs and he like does all these stunts and everything you know this little yeah this kind of little bucket he kind of bad boy you know so I guess like I was thinking last time I was like I wonder if your imagination is different than mine actually I'm very imaginative I'm a huge fan of horror particularly and horror films horror films horror books what music radio dramas that are involved with horror for example like the white vault for instance pasteurize and check them out they're awesome are they oh yeah they're full and scholar productions actually and is that one you're doing voiceover and yes right okay so I mean I've got to plug these shows because I'm so excited about them no of course and we're gonna plug them to whenever we whenever we bring the we'll do an intro for the show later yeah we'll make sure to plug him but oh thank you so so first let's talk about imagination a little yes Naboo sorry about that it's okay so there was just a knock at the door we don't I'm not sure who it was but so Naboo lets you know when she does she alert barks she does actually what's funny what I work at Perkins school for the blind at the Perkins library and at work if somebody comes by my office she's like whoa whoa whoa like she gets all worked up she barks maybe five six times but quick just to let me know they're there can you tell of the tone even down to the smallest level in her bark like if she's trying to if she's trying to be like alert you or if she's trying to let them know that you're there or like you able to different like notice different levels of like intonation that she has in her voice yes I am for example if she's startled she'll do a very quick short high-pitched bark and then if somebody comes by that she doesn't like she'll she'll get up and walk over to them just like hmm you know just like growl get out my mom used to do that when I bring this kid Wayne over all the time just growl yeah yeah how dare you get them out of here oh yeah dude and he was a bit of a deviant but yeah your imagination like I was thinking last night I was like my imagination is almost kind of limited by by colors you know I wonder if like my imagination got caged up you know because it's it's like limited a little bit by knowing like what a lot of different colors are and how the world is kind of or how the society we live in is kind of built you know yeah well you can you can definitely expand all that like noticing smells whenever you're somewhere let's say out and about walking by shops or something you can smell all the different things coming out of a shop and sometimes you can even tell where you are based on the smell so just starting to notice that in your own life too actually meditation exercise is help with that mindfulness where you you notice oh I'm having this thought or I'm thinking about what I need to do but I'm just gonna let it go and think about you know let's see where my thoughts go naturally and what do I notice around me like something like a sound of a fan can be soothing kind of white noise intermittent can cause your brain to focus harder on an arm a task that you're working on and that's all mindfulness so doing something like that can help you get to that same level that I'm that I'm mentioning where you're discussing all the five senses and how they implement how they work together to create that multi-sensory picture of where you're at yeah so but in terms of imagination actually my friend and I as teenagers we used to get on the phone and this is when people actually used to talk on the phone instead of texting and Instagraming and twig tweeting to each other we would sit on the phone for hours I kid you not and sometimes we would do online mud games you know where you would that is like a D&D sort of online now that Dungeons and Dragons you're saying right right yeah and you can play these how because so you know how online they have a graphic system and multiplayer verse etc this is all done through command line so you modify it by going in you bring up like a command line box kind of like we used to do with DOS right HTML we can enter in code mm-hmm and you you enter textual text commands like the old text adventures used to be in the 90s on the old DOS systems and you would enter commands and then a lot of the games now you can insert a sound pack mm-hmm which would take the place of some of those longer command line prompts and we can listen to sound effects in 3d space and figure out where we're at environments and things like that spells all of those have sounds related to them I see so by adding in sound packs you're able to get like a more of an experience where you can actually enjoy a multi sensory like a video game experience now so with virtual reality kind of looming does that seem very exciting to like yes the blind community oh yes deep-end games actually produced one called perception and it's about this main character who's blind and she's got to go to her grandfather's house go through it and solve the mystery of what happened to him and how he died and it starts off it's fully voice-acted it's 3d audio space and I've contacted them I was like hey guys you're awesome like how do I play this they're just like oh we we believe it's accessible let us know you know so I've got to get my nephew to help me out here and what's it called again I'm gonna write that down perception perception it sounds really really interesting oh yeah oh yeah the trailers are amazing and the voice acting is spot-on and so when you're listening to these types of things mean you get everything from sound right I mean you're not able to yes and then you have like some kind of extra I believe it's her or it's like an extra voice that tells you where you where you are and how many meters away from something you're standing and that's all that would additionally help you navigate and they're also iOS virtual reality games out there and you're you able like so a virtual reality game like for me I would take the head the video the video the visual set like the goggles and put them over my head my over my eyes and then you know I would have the headphones on I would listen to the experience but I'll also be able to see it for you what is that experience like it's more just sound based it's more sound based where you would have the set of headphones on and everything would be in binaural audio which is a simulated 3d space oh wow okay so it's a different type of audio specifically for people that are hearing impaired they actually make it for anyone who who wants to play the game a lot of these have graphical interfaces built in so anyone can play them I see the goal is just to make it fully accessible for all and which is great because if you have a little bit of vision you might be able to see the graphic in a graphical interface as well let's see there's a YouTube video of a guy that has a lot more vision than I than I do I would say he plays a Star Wars virtual reality game and is able to move the the lander around successfully on his own without dying I see and he gets super excited about it obviously it's and but your imagination like so you have color in your imagination you're imagining things yeah I'm losing color perception a little bit so my ability to tell shades apart like blue green for example if they're close or if purple is close to blue sometimes it's hard to tell but I do imagine it for what color I have that will enter into it and of course it goes into dreams as well so can your dog tell like if someone is lying I wish you think she can tell if someone is trustworthy or not it's sort of like that saying where you believe kids you can't fool a baby or a dog you know that's saying I'm probably saying it wrong here but that's what we do here but she can certainly tell if someone's not trustworthy she doesn't like them she gets a bad vibe and maybe will bark a little bit more if they show up and doesn't trust them doesn't really want to go near them avoids them we were on the bike path once just walking with a couple people and there was some guy that was walking down the bike path for some reason she didn't like him so she pulled us way over into the grass went around him and just kind of stopped as he walked by because he was like oh hi there oh wow so I said hi and she just stood there and just didn't want to move until he walked by just staring at him and you were able to just kind of feel that vibe from her take those cues a hundred percent yep because she was standing very still and kind of tense right and you trust her a whole heartless there's no there's no like unless it probably comes to a treat I'm guessing there is no misconception about what her intentions are yeah it's she's pretty spot-on trustworthy dog that's pretty cool huh yeah my first service dog was like that too but this one is a lot more protective of me not to the point where she'll bite or attack I do think if I was being mugged or someone was was trying to attack me in some way she would step in and try to bite them at that point because she's protective but she wouldn't just bite somebody right now do you feel like you said you like horror films yes there are to me it feels like you're already like in the dark a lot like I would feel I felt like it would be double scary hey you want to you want to promote me for in the dark happy to be on that yeah I had to say is that a show it's a show it's a blind protagonist on the CW oh wow I don't even know that yeah that was a pun so okay perfect no I know that yeah I know you do voiceover work and I want to I want to learn more about the about the characters you play in those but yeah I'm just curious I guess it like you know what um like what's what why the horror genre do you feel like I'm wondering just is there any correlation between what your daily kind of existence or experience with the world is and if you think it ties into liking that genre that's a good question I think it ties into I love adrenaline rush and just that whole fight-or-flight response where but isn't ever I feel like everything will be in a general and rusty like a bee it's true when you're crossing a street if a car just comes out of nowhere you're like oh my god I'm gonna die but in this case you're able to like every freaking like every ten minutes is the X games I feel like for you it can be depending on where you're at whether or not you're getting you know assistance or if you know where you are like when you're lost oh my god that's anxiety-provoking yeah especially at night and what if your dog wasn't there what if uh Naboo wasn't there yeah that would be harder I'd have to figure it out with my cane and it would be a lot slower of a process I'd have to slowly map out my surroundings and find let's say the nearest street crossing and then the nearest building and ask for help like just go in I've done that before oh I'm sure yeah like lift Uber drivers a lot of drivers don't speak the language very well they don't understand a lot like what do you mean the language of sight or the language of just English yeah English yeah oh yeah there's a lot of dudes and then I'll speak any language a couple of them I know right yeah I've had some guys that don't speak anything dude that is but you pick a letter of the alphabet out of a hat they have no idea what you're talking about they can't read signs yeah I know I know it's frustrating so I went to the Chumpsford Center for the Arts ones and they drop me off like the guy had no idea he's like building building I'm like sir I need to go to the Chumpsford Center for the Arts here's where it is like this is what it looks like there's a sign right outside it's huge you can't miss it I'll tell you if I can see it I'll tell you he's like a building oh no building no no building I'm like yeah obviously I can tell as well that there's no built we're in a parking lot like we're come on yeah yeah let's find a no building I'm like alright see you later see you never see you later you're getting a three-star rating sorry buddy um do you find that um do you find that so more about that horror genre sorry let me think cuz I'm not good of a thinker but more about the horror genre so is it because yeah when you said that like crossing a street I can't even imagine not being able to see and crossing a street right on red is not a fun thing and then it would just be so scary like what you don't know if the guy over to your left is like not paying attention or sure and a lot of people are on their phones so it's a more of a risk for anyone crossing now does can you feel that vibe if somebody's on their phone I feel like a different vibe than somebody just sitting there like say if I'm just sitting here yeah unfortunately not I can't I can't tell that at all it just looks like they're sitting waiting to proceed at the next cycle right what does it feel like can you get a feeling from it though not really like I can't tell unless the person kind of pulls forward and then stops and then pulls forward then I can tell that they're they're distracted okay but I don't really get any intuitive feelings from it mainly what my intuition works on for me or works well with me is is let's say a friend wants to go on a job interview and they tell me oh I'm going on a job interview at noon what do you think am I gonna do well and I'll think okay so I'll put what I know about this person's style as well as the person they're going to see and what their history with this person was what they told me their previous interaction was and then my gut instinct and I'll kind of come up with an intuitive I think you'll do great or I'm not really sure this is gonna work out but this will lead to other opportunities for you and it usually turns out to be that way do you feel like more of a computer than a person sometimes oh yeah oh yeah that's that's actually very accurate because social interaction can be nerve-wracking I have a little bit of social anxiety in certain situations yeah and I like the pre-programmed like five questions when you start a conversation how are you you know what do you do you know where do you live those those five like small talk questions that helps give you more of a world a little bit of world to start with mm-hmm and like a little it like yeah it helps give you some information it helps give you yeah it does but it's also as a person who can't make eye contact it is very difficult if you're in a group to find when is a good time to jump into the conversation and add something to it so it's like being stoned then kind of I think because yeah I've been high sometimes and I'm standing there and then I don't know when to jump in and then everybody leaves you know you're like where'd you go do you feel like a damsel in distress sometimes I feel like if I saw like if there's a woman walking around who's who's blind then I'm I feel like is she like a city it like not a sitting duck but is she um is she like a city like do you feel like a potential victim possibly ever ah so I did more so when I was at like I went to school at Simmons for undergrad and what is that oh that's sorry that's a school in Boston it's it's an all-girls school okay but in that area like the Fenway area of Boston as you know the Red Sox play there it's like a lot of events a lot of drunk people on alcoholism a lot so it can be a little unnerving like I've had people just go you know when I'm walking by or something yeah we're like hey baby you want to like you want to you want to you want to talk to me or whatever I'm just like no so I had my service dog that made me feel a lot better right and then I took self-defense and I took Campo Grotti so it's like I know the basics I know how to shove my fingers into somebody's eye sockets like that will stop them right away or you know you shove your fingers up their nostrils oh yeah boom or into their neck into their atoms up with their guy if you can reach them oh yeah just you just know the basic defensive strategies and it really gives you a lot of confidence like you feel better traveling at night in that area but other than that unless you feel like a potential like because you have your sight impaired right now I'm gonna keep using different terms because I don't know what I'm not you're good but do you do you feel like my intentions are good I mean yeah I don't sometimes I get vibes from people where I feel like they may not have great intentions and I'll just cut the conversation short and move on okay yeah I don't want you to feel like that for me do you know like I know you do voice acting I know you do podcasting or in that universe yeah I mean I yeah I just I've never got to spend time with someone that couldn't see you know so I've just always been curious no no question is a bad question you know everything is is fine like I don't get offended or anything I'm happy to try to give you a slice into into what it's like yeah although every person who is blind has a different perspective on their life depending on when that where they're at really oh yes now when you say where they're at do you mean where they're at in what so in terms of like how long they've been blind when they lost their vision whether or not they have some usable vision or if they were born with no vision people who are born with no vision their concept development is depending on who taught them and what school system they were at they may or may not have concepts of different things like like what certain animals look like for example and so were you on that scale you have some concept some concepts yeah there are some things like for example when I read in books where it says so and so eyes sparkled with amusement I'm like what does that mean how do they sparkle does it like do they have more tears in their eyes because they were so amused and so the light was catching off of the tears and glistening on their eyes but I have actually like one time I was holding my my niece when she was a baby and I was looking at her eyes and I could see the sparkle it was like the first time I could see that it was so cool oh yeah babies have more of it to me that thing is like it's like a light behind somebody's eyes that's like not like a moisture thing to me this is my perception of it yeah and it's like something of like peacefulness or comfort so I think you see that or like excitement can sometimes like flare it up in people mm-hmm in younger people I think excitement flares it up in older people I think sentiment or like nostalgia nostalgia that's a great one joy mm-hmm like things like that really kind of yes happiness things that kind of mold like our or fluff your emotion oh like positively I think those are things that would add like a sparkle to somebody's eye maybe that's sweet you know yeah yeah I just like now what about like like would you close your eyes ever you just like there's no point in it oh well because I have some vision yeah I do I close my eyes like when I'm gonna go to sleep or let's say sometimes I'll be light sensitive so if I don't have my sunglasses and it's super bright out I'm on the beach and the Sun is glaring off the sand throwing up light yeah agonizing oh so I close my eyes so what does that feel like for you that just feels like an intent it's just an intense like what whiteness kind of color it kind of yeah kind of like well because I mean I can see general colors so let's say I'm looking at the yellow sand and it's just a lot of light it kind of washes everything out and it's unless I'm squinting really hard and my eyes start tearing I'm unable to really make a lot of other things out right for a long before my eyes start to water so at that point closing them is the best but it is similar to just this glaring white field of light and then I close them and it's red because you know that's when you close your eyes that's what you see if there's it's bright hmm if you aren't sure then you are gonna be because the truth is that this past weekend is brought to you by Skillshare if you if you if you're

months now that skillshare.com slash Theo Vaughn and now let's get back to this beautiful blind episode and now what if I put like a woman like 50 feet away from you okay mm-hmm and I put your mother 50 feet away from you right yeah do you think you would know the difference between the two of them if they talked yes if they didn't say anything at all so if I could like can you feel that you're I'm just trying to get an idea if this makes any sense can you feel like that your mother is close like you know I'm saying kind of through the feeling wise no because like I don't have any extra sort of intuitive sense of who is who unless I have some additional cues okay so it would depend on the contrast the lighting like it was it was decently lit but no glare let's say like an overcast day cloudy day and somebody was 50 feet but the background was not complex so I wouldn't get confused by trees or houses very specific mm-hmm exactly so just like just like nothing almost right yeah so let's say they were standing on the beach right they were staying on sand and there was nothing else to clutter the background I would be able to see them but then if I could preview whose clothing or outfits looked like what and if they had very contrasting compared to each other outfits I'd be able to tell okay that's my mom standing on the left and this is mystery person number one on the right you know because they're wearing a white shirt on the right my mom's wearing a red shirt right right like so the more clues you have mm-hmm so it's a lot of clues a lot of puzzle pieces so the detective analogy earlier was good so it's a lot of clues when you can't see mm-hmm a lot of cues and things you put together do you find that or do you get any sense that certain cultures are friendlier than others oh certainly like in the UK and here in the US and Germany they're very inclusive of people with disabilities in general and the UK in particular has made a lot of wonderful strides like audio description captioning for example wow they audio describe like double the amount that we do and that we're mandated other chatty mm-hmm I mean they are chatty yeah especially if they've been drinking but no I'm making a joke there so they have so you're saying that the UK really is kind of the leader in that sort of world I would say the UK Germany you know they've done a lot to to include people and even Switzerland and I would say and then the US definitely I hope it continues to go that way and other countries in in Europe like for example where I'm from Serbia they are not as inclusive they're a little behind the times yeah but they're getting there I know Perkins is working with them through Perkins International to try to teach teachers from there how to better instruct their students and include them get them prepared for mainstream work mm-hmm and then in India for example that they're working hard to get some of the I guess poorer families communities to include people with disabilities in the workforce mm-hmm so it's getting there it's just our the first world countries have to help the third world to get there which in the problem is also have we can't get half the first world people to frickin get a job or to go to work jeepers we need to help our own people it must be do you can you tell like when you get a vibe when you're around someone who can see who has all the faculties and they're like oh they're not even trying yeah sorry no it's okay yes definitely have had that experience before where people complain that they can't find a job but they're not really trying like they're just selecting the unemployment you know yeah you're like I can't find yeah I can't find like you know I'll take any job here at this point like any additional side gig would be welcome but you're not you want me to do you mentioned earlier that you have a boyfriend is it is it I would imagine that it's let me think about what I think when I'm he's also visually impaired as well yes well he's missing out I'll tell you that thank you that I'm not trying to I mean I'm always trying to hit on everybody a little bit but at the same time I'm I would never be disrespectful your boyfriend um no no no worries um yeah I think I'll say this for myself especially when I was young I would probably be scared if someone was blind you know I would be like at it yeah and I don't mean this in a negative way I'm just trying to be honest I would feel oh yeah yeah I was probably scared I was probably you know I didn't know what to do I would think yeah if I go engage with them am I gonna mess am I gonna mess things up or something like whatever is going on in their world like am I going to hey you're not alone a lot of people don't know how to approach yeah the blindness community I think on our end what we could do better is communicate what what we're thinking and how we're feeling because our body language is a lot less like a lot of us sit still or don't move a lot because we don't have the concept of you know like for example Italians like they talk with their hands or this and whatever for us we don't really have that as a natural part of our lives like we don't right just to circulate just to circulate yeah that's good and that's off-putting to others who have that as part of their or they use they get cues from others how they're feeling through the body language 100% yeah you get a lot of that yeah you get clues from somebody's activity if they're yeah just there you can get a lot of a lot more clues yeah I didn't know how many clues it is oh yeah so it would be good on our part to communicate oh I'm not upset I'm just you know I'm thinking or like I know my face probably looks like I'm pissed off right now but I'm just I'm spacing out or I'm not really I'm thinking about what I have to do at work tomorrow I'm not pissed at you because sometimes our facial expressions don't match how we well how we're feeling or what we're thinking wow and that can be off-putting to people also I had to be told this because I used to sit like this where my hands were across my stomach crossed over myself and that looks like you are closing or that yeah I guess no thanks yeah it's usually about 13 years old so different times but but to you that see people would what clue is that given off to people that I'm closed off and not welcoming interaction yeah so you have to sit very open like your arms have to be out to your sides you know I've actually read a bunch of stuff on body language just to try to understand the concept of it and then a lot of people also when they shake someone's hand if they're blind like they're just like oh god how am I gonna do this so what I do as a person was blind is I'll I'll put my hand out first I'll be like oh nice to meet you yeah toward the middle of my body because you know you don't want to put it way out to the side that just kind of looks weird and you're exuding friendliness by taking the cue first and taking the awkwardness out of the situation so it's just we we have to educate ourselves on body language and make it more comfortable I love how you have just an ability minutes and this is just such a neat gift that you see that you probably I think as a person to seem to have is to recognize your pardon things like you know instead of saying like oh everybody needs to do this or people could do this it's like oh the blind community or as a person that site impaired we could do this these are things it's like yeah we all we all can soft skills yes but we all can always help our own situation even if we think something else is like really impairing us yeah there's always like our own part in it kill him with kindness that's the way to do it yeah if you can if you're grumpy that day just don't talk yeah just kill him huh oh my god you got me into the horror films are you making me think of the dark arts in here take that axe you know it must be so I mean do you could if you if you're blind you feel like everybody could be a killer hmm sometimes like there's so much more opportunity for you to think there are people that are killers like I can see people I'm like oh they're not killers you know yeah but for you I feel like you could always be like fantasizing as somebody in the distance with like a bow and arrow or something unique oh yeah sometimes you can freak yourself out that way like oh my god a bunch of zombies are gonna break into this car and they're gonna eat me yeah like your imagination must be have oh yeah does your imagination is it very active it's very active wow yeah like if I watch a horror film like for example I just saw the haunted that the series on Netflix have you seen it no I have no it's scary yes a little too real and so horror films I just thought of this because they have so many more sound cues they do they do and the sound design is amazing yeah cuz it's yeah it's it's trying to build up in emotion whereas a lot of other things aren't really doing that they're just kind of telling true story like point blank yeah like bird box for example with Sandra Bullock yeah super amazing sound design with the sat with the minute sounds that you would hear in your environment only they're exaggerated enough just so that anyone can notice them and they're not as crazy with the jump scares which gets old yeah and I agree yeah horror films kind of they got they got lazy really they did yeah I miss the old when I was young they had Jason Voorhees they had like Friday the 13th oh yeah some of those things Nightmare on Elm Street yeah Michael Myers I bet that stuff I bet the Michael Mike the Halloween's were really good probably the early ones yeah yeah they were pretty good I think they could have done I mean this is 70s but yeah I think they should have made it stereo versus mono where it's like coming out of just one channel in the center and then the music is stereo yeah it could have been but you know for what it was at the time it was really good yeah yeah oh I'd love to see I wonder how interesting it would be if you design this like help design the sound for a horror film I bet that would be fascinating awesome do you feel like we use the skills because that's such a unique skill that you like a sensory ability to connect to a sound at a level that I couldn't do yeah you know because yours your senses in that space are more cute I wouldn't want to make it 5.1 surround like most movies are anyway where it surrounds you like the you wouldn't want to I would I would want to yes and I would want to make the so you know how when people are on camera the actors unlike audio drama they are in the center unless they're coming on to set from another room that's when you would hear them off to the side but otherwise they're coming from the center so both channels directly boom in front of you because the camera's focusing on them what I would want to do is create like a virtual reality horror movie where you walk through like a fly on the wall and you get to hear these things happening and the people move around you in space like 5.1 surround sound because that would make it more real especially if things were happening to you and if you can make it like a 4d sensory experience where not only do you have the movie and the headphones around everything's happening around you but you would smell things like blood for example yeah or maybe you'd have props to use along with the movie like like let's say you have to kill the killer so you'd be given a prop gun oh wow something like that would be a you actually feel and you and have yeah yeah huh that would draw so many audiences I think just maybe you're talking like 5d I mean maybe one you need another d go all out yeah it's just so yeah it's like well I wonder do down do people does Hollywood come and tap into the blonde community to learn more about sound or their groups that do that it seems like it would be almost like a goldmine or they would that you know they would go to a mine that has the value in it is there any like connection to my knowledge no but I do know that they have experts and consultants that they go to for example for the movie bird box I know they went to a couple of people who are blind to inquire about how things were being portrayed like Braille for example signage and things I'm not sure on the sound design if they went to someone who's blind but I am aware of a BBC the BBC does like 3d audio radio dramas for their for their programming and they did employ someone who's totally blind as a sound designer that that is one example that I can think of and I know there are sound designers out there I just don't know if Hollywood collaborates but that would be great that's a great idea yeah cuz you guys are like hawks almost do you feel like a bird is there an animal you feel like a little bit you kind of relate to a little bit more like is there an animal you feel in the world and you're like oh that animal has a very similar experience maybe to mine a little bit is that ever happening there it can be a no I'm just I'm just trying to wonder besides an AI I say I would say maybe maybe like an artificial intelligence a computer you know I see machine you know cyborg because you feel a lot of times things are more like a machine almost like you have to get clues yeah you get information and then you're able to build more of a world which is the same way people do programming yes and you can reprogram your brain so for example like habits you don't like you can reprogram yourself to not like those habits that you love what now you must have a much more because you're right there at the atomic I bet but I bet you have more of an access to the atomic level of that than I would because I'm out here in this comfort zone you know just a damn sugar lizard out here whereas you're down there working with the building blocks more inside of your senses sometimes so is it easy for you to to do that to like reprogram yourself I'm just fascinated with psychology as a person and I think that's just more of my my own interest than my ability to work with it but if you believe something it's it's funny how the more you believe something the more it is so if you put something out there into the universe and say oh I want this to be this way it will or if you have a negative sense of something that the self-fulfilling prophecy will happen as well which is unfortunate that's but it seems like you get what you put out there so in terms of my ability to improve my programming and adjust it's I have to constantly believe that it will work if I stop believing it's gonna work or I give up or I get lazy it's not gonna work it's just gonna go back to where it was is it it would feel like it would be easier for you to give up because you don't it just feels like it would be easier does it feel like that to you ever or you don't know what I'm talking about is I understand what I'm saying kind of I do like the with depression with getting down or yeah I guess so yeah yeah it certainly can like in my early 20s through my mid 20s it was a factor in my life as well as high school because I had a lot of challenges with math getting through math I was just to quickly mention I was mainstream so I went to public school keeping up with calculus or pre-calc trig all that yeah when the teacher was understanding and helpful it was it was okay I was able to work with them the later the more advanced the concepts got the less time the general ed teachers had to work with me on it after school before school etc and I would fall behind sometimes my grades would drop and I was huge into having good grades yeah didn't want to fail out or not pass the MCAS or you know even the SATs I needed it was important to get a good score to get go to a good school wow and so I pushed myself and wasn't always succeeding in math and felt like okay what am I gonna do you know I got really depressed and also the fact that it was harder to make friends was making it only adds to it worse but when I got a dog man it was so much easier to make friends people love dogs oh yeah as long as you're putting the attention on the dog and not yourself to begin with people feel a lot more comfortable hmm so I use that as my kind of helpful strategy and working through depression I I have a couple of really good friends who were going through similar times we helped each other out we were there for each other and it's important to recognize when you're down let yourself be down and then find a way to pull yourself out mine was creativity just being as creative as possible yeah yeah and you can see that even in your work I mean it seems like you really go beyond what people would what an everyday person would expect of a blind person like you kind of want to kind of change the norm a little bit yeah technology helps us level the playing field yeah it's interesting because you work and now in voiceover you are a character actress right yes yeah I do a lot of accents and different characters put myself into them yeah one of the best pieces of advice I ever came across with acting is I don't know if you agree with this since you're an actor yourself and stand-up comedian I found that when they say that when you put yourself into whatever character you're playing whether or not you're dressing it up with an accent or not if you put your own truth into it it is what they're looking for hmm just heard that today from Gianni actually who really yeah he's actually our actor on set who's here is Gianni and he's a yeah he was just in a film and and yeah he was just helping me with some lines earlier and he literally said that like a half hour before you got here it's a small so yeah it's a small circle of truth right here so is that and how did you get into that did you stumbled into it really yes thank you Stephen King I went to my local library to pick out I used to get books on tape oh yeah those are good oh yeah we should get movies at the library you remember that or oh yeah oh yeah I used to borrow those two yeah force my family watch all these horror films that they hated it's so dark arts dude I would be so scared if I had a blind child who brought him horror films all the time they don't want to piss me off I bet they wouldn't do your with your family ever did they did your family ever get cuz here's another thing now you making me think some people would be scared of blind people oh my god yeah like not in a way yeah but like in a way yeah like in a way where like like maybe you're actually just pretending and you're working for the other side or something yeah yeah like what if they're just you know see they would make really good Russian spies right yeah no I'm just kidding no yeah I think but I could see especially at young ages people being very I guess like it must with some people must you must be able to just see a clear line in people like some people are just so empathetic probably and so like did you see a lot of that growing up or do you see a lot of that more of as an adult um that's let's see so as a kid I did notice that the teachers around me did try their best to accommodate a lot of them just weren't sure what I needed I was a dual learner so used large print on a video magnifier and Braille and so they were always like uh so you use print but how are we supposed to what do you what do you exactly need yeah so they were like empathetic to a point but they were also stressed out because they're like oh god we have like 30 kids and we have to accommodate this blind kid oh my god what am I gonna do but the kids at that age the younger the better they were they were more accepting but then middle school high school they were just like see you later yeah you know but in college as an adult I found a mixture of both where people were really mature and cool about it and interested to know and it helped that I went to a liberal school as well but yeah Simmons you said Simmons yeah now a lot of pervy dudes just trying to bang a blind gal or what honestly well there's a lot of that too I can imagine yeah cuz there's a lot of guys you know kind of like different types of styles of stuff you know and I just wonder if if that did you get some of that I did I got some of that kind of thing where people were trying to flirt with me but a lot of the time I didn't pick up on it cuz I'm like who'd want to flirt with me right you know I guess my confidence was not as as solid at that point so I was just like nobody likes me why would anybody want to talk to me oh man that must have been such a tough feeling huh yeah it was kind of it contributed to the depression for a bit there but that happens all teenagers sort of go through that whole angsty period in their lives or they're like true my life sucks everyone hates me nobody understands me why am I even here yeah but I didn't pick up on it like friends would tell me oh so-and-so is totally hitting on you and be like really what how do you get that where do you get that from well the comments and whatever they were staring at you I'm like really okay that's that's cool not interested but that's cool and in college or would you get some more pervy type of dudes I could see a guy that's been like hey or even a guy not pervy just very honest like hey I've always wanted to make love to a blind woman is just something you'd be interested in you know I I got like when I did the online dating thing for a bit and put on my profile because I was sick of dealing with people that found out that I was blind and then we're like see you later just ghosted so I was like no I'm done with this BS crap like I'm just gonna post right here that I'm visually impaired if you don't like it like don't even bother blind AF that's what I'd put on there you know the blind ever after yeah oh blind as fuck you know blind as fuck yeah just to be you know I'm saying like might as well also be progressive you know I'm saying like not only my blind dude but I'm so fucking blind exactly John Cena like you can't see me you know blind as fuck until I drink so I have guys that came in like that so so you dated online and so then you just put blind I did yeah and it was that easier it was honestly people just knew and they weren't like all weird yeah about it when they found out I mean I met up with a couple of them and then was just like yeah now good you know yeah that's basically I think that is all I'm getting for everyone think you describe that yeah that's everybody's experience yeah a lot of times fan you meet up and then yeah yeah you're just like interesting I met a mathematician one time and he talked about math the entire time like dude you do realize I hate math right I really hate math like let's just talk about random stuff and then go our separate ways because I'm never gonna contact you again to be honest you're like man I wish I was blind and deaf right now right now that would be great look that's how I feel like sometimes I'm like gosh I wish sometimes I wish you know what's crazy as I wish and I guess it's a selfish thing to say to somebody that can't that has that sight and pair but that sometimes I wish I just could shut down some of the sensory overload well see if your computer you can just go visual or ocular sensors off and just turn it off for the moment that would be great but I'm waiting for the days when not only the singularity happens but we're able to get a chip in planet that can't be hacked apple you're listening I know that way we can turn off senses we don't want for the time being oh wow you that could be possible but it certainly makes sense huh self-driving cars are things so I I don't see why not with this could help a lot of people out do you feel sometimes like you have more of an intuitiveness to I don't even know what but maybe how people are feeling sometimes yeah like are there other intuitions that you that you just if you had to just trust your own it trust your own instincts or something are there things that you what can you do better than people that can see that and maybe they could do it sounds like a job interview they could do they did they may be able to do it better but they're not able to recognize it because they don't live in the same space that you do like is there yeah I I know what you mean and not even in a braggadocious way but what do you feel like you have more of an insight into or more of a ability to do than people that are almost overwhelmed with sight or just that or that have that have to see all the time yeah I would say focusing on one task in our technology driven ADD age it's impossible for people to focus on anything longer than three seconds we're kind of like Dory the goldfish right oh yeah so from finding Nemo she's her memories like oh yeah yeah I remember yeah cute comic comedian reference right but um we we tend to get distracted very easily to different things and get bored quick I would say that if I'm interested in something I can focus on it until I'm done with that so whether it is a particular song or particular movie I like to I really enjoy personally art and I don't know if this is related to me being blind or if this is just a personality thing but I love admiring people's art whether it is through something auditory art like tap dancing or going to the nutcracker and listening to an audio described version of the performance I can really enjoy all the nuances of the work and the time that went into practicing and practicing and completely solidifying their performance to get to that point like Broadway plays for example I love them I can pick up on people's voice so much going on mm-hmm there's so much going on specific Hamilton is hard to follow I can tell you that yeah but it's hard to hear about on Twitter too I feel you but I imagine that it's great I haven't been but I'm his it is but I a Lion King was the last time oh Broadway musical that I went to but I could imagine that because there's a lot of a lot of stuff going on but it's very specific and it's organized to portray something if to portray a show to portray a story yeah art imitates life and you're able to put that together mm-hmm yeah I love it it's it's brilliant and in general just being able to focus on one thing or another or pick up on things others don't I've noticed that we we tend to pick up on other sensory cues that folks didn't maybe someone who's cited who's around us did not because they were focusing on what the person was wearing totally you know oh so-and-so you know I love their hairstyle or whatever dress it was this brand and this material I'm like I have no idea what you're talking about but you know their voice expressed this or their footsteps you know they sounded kind of less confident because their gate was stumbling or not even or what have you so wow it's so crazy I feel like you have like such a I guess just like you have such you're that the ability to hear and be able to interpret things so much it just feels like such a unique skill kind of and anyone can develop it like if you know and and obviously this is not something I would ever wish upon anyone but let's say you lost your vision temporarily due to something mm-hmm some surgery or what have you I love surgery too yeah I do so I could see it surgery that's awesome I could see it happen I listened to your last episode where you were discussing you were thinking about being a doctor and yeah and then they brought you in and they just kind of dumped you into it all that must have been horrible yeah oh with Tom's cigarette yeah yeah yeah but yeah surgery I mean watching it is interesting yeah yeah I guess I mean that kind of stuff kind of creeps me out I mean I think you know if you're in a horror flicks it might be more your vibe you know it might be one of my colleagues had a major abdominal surgery and he was supposed to go to sleep under local but as you know it never works like it's supposed to mm-hmm and he woke up and he was awake during the whole thing he was traumatized poor guy it was just Jeepers yeah awful yeah just kind of mosey and around during your own lobotomy that sounds awful yeah it sounds risky yeah definitely for your psyche yeah that sounds risky for your psyche anyone can develop those skills of recognizing nuance and sound but so then we get lazy with our psych then we get or cuz cuz we have sight we yes you use it as your primary sight lazy right like you take it all in visually oh yes I know I am yeah you know additional you know sound cues cuz you can see it yeah it makes sense yeah it makes sense I guess but it also it makes it makes me almost forget about the other senses that I have sometimes I get so just used to looking at the picture you know but actually for Halloween one of my favorite games to play with friends was blindfold everybody and then stick their hands in bowls of stuff oh yeah oh this is worms when it's actually spaghetti yeah like peel grapes oh you want to hold an eyeball so does everything does the world feel a little bit haunted since you can't see that much like is everything feel kind of like is it spooky or does it feel like kind of like like you're in sound of music or like what does it feel like I guess it depends on my frame of mind hmm so if I freak myself out in some way by watching something or I don't know hearing some story that really sticks with me and I'm out and about by myself I'm like oh my god I'm gonna get murdered this is really creepy and then try to come up sometimes I'll even try to come up with a story or like even if I do get startled I'm like okay how did I do that like what did I do to get startled I'm gonna need this for voice acting so I'll try to bring it over bring over those those natural reactions and keep it in mind like how do I react and I'll watch movies and I'll pay attention to the actors how they do it and what makes them a good performer and try to adopt it so I kind of multitask it all but sound of music if I'm really excited about something like I'll tell you when I got this opportunity I was so excited the last couple of days have been like oh my god the world is awesome yeah that's cool yeah we're really excited too you know we've been trying to find somebody um honestly we've been trying to find a blind person for a while really yeah oh so we need more blind people I think hey I can recommend some more people if you need if we have follow-up questions I think this has been very interesting we have a couple of video calls that came in as well sure so let's put our headphones on and this first one comes from Marco hey Theo Marco from New Zealand my question is if there's one thing that she comes across every day that sighted people don't understand that they could change to help her what would that be gang gang gang gang gang Marco thank you that's a good question Tanya what do you think about that so should I leave these on or take them yeah we'll leave them on we have a couple more we have a couple that are okay we had a we had a ton actually we got we procured a couple so one thing that sighted people could do in my opinion that would help is if they could just let us know what specifically makes them uncomfortable in in situations and what we could do better to to sort of put them at ease that would be helpful for us because then it wouldn't be all on us to try figure out how to how to make people comfortable but then also if we should get better about asking for help I think if we need it but then I guess sighted people should trust us to know what we need and when we need help and just to let them know what it is and also don't be afraid to ask questions that's one of the things a lot of people aren't comfortable with which I get I mean I would feel the same way I don't know much about mobility issues so if I were talking to someone with mobility issues I would feel like I'm gonna offend them I don't want to ask anything that's rude or ignorant and it's hard because you're making yourself vulnerable by asking but my thought is just just put it out there if you have any questions go for it yeah the other thing is giving directions I think people need to get way better it's like oh yeah it's over there it's it's that way I'm sorry where to my right to my left and then I just start pointing in every cardinal direction north southeast or west which which direction yeah oh they're always like yeah go a couple blocks to you a smell a little bit of skirt steak and then take a left what nice nice you're like what is what are you on yeah that's a great question it's interesting because it just sounds like really communication you know do you feel like in the times that we're in right now or like not the times but as the times that like the media likes to make it feel like we're in yeah with like social justice warriors and everybody get a getting offended that people are people I've noticed are less feel less comfortable asking questions that can actually be helpful do you notice any of that like people are more worried about offending you than they are about engaging with you all the time it's just easier not to engage than risk offending someone and getting sued right everyone's afraid of getting sued and that must come down a tougher in even in your community because or not in that in this lawsuit way but just or maybe so but also just that you know you need more communication yes I think communication for us is key because we may not be able to tell body language or eye contact whether the person is interested in communicating with us or interacting so just talking and literally talking everything out yeah which doesn't sound intuitive at all because you guys are used to body language and just kind of hey I'm pointing at you hey you know gesturing and what have you so that's a big gap right there and if we all just used our words a lot more instead of memes and emojis I think we'd get more we need to go back to the 90s I know yeah back when there was some real actually information I know I know I miss that yeah it's interesting and now we have movies with all texting like the whole movie is texting and Skyping right yeah it's like what is that even about is this yeah that's regular life I know what else do we have let's take another question that came in this was actually a patreon question so it was a right it comes from a Dalton Windham he said if you had perfect vision for just one day what would you do during that time ooh that's awesome probably hmm look at the coral reef or go to go to all the tourist attractions like the Grand Canyon and maybe climb a mountain look at the view all the things that are visual I would probably want to want to do like all the traditional and maybe even oh I'd probably want to be on set for a day and just act without having to worry about not meeting my mark I'd want to incorporate that somewhere in that day so yeah you take that worry out of your field and then you can just be even more free probably yeah yeah yeah do some on-camera work with perfect vision would be awesome yeah that's cool that is a good one anything else Nick that came in you liked yeah this this was a frequently asked one that we had two that were really frequent here's the first one what up Theo what up Tanya gang what up Theo what up Tanya gang gang anyway I was wondering real quick Tanya you know do you have dreams and we have dreams do you see things do you just hear things like I mean I guess seeing things I don't know it might sound ignorant to say that but I just I've often wondered what happens when blind people dream do you have like I don't know visions maybe I don't know the question you know interesting yeah what are your dreams like kind of are they yeah so first of all I want to compliment you on the stereo recording you had there that was cool and yeah I I do dream and see things in my dreams like I have I wouldn't say my sight is any better some of my friends that have had more sight before tell me that their dreams are a lot more vivid and visual so everyone is different with that and the more people you ask the different responses you're gonna get but for me it's I can see things the same as in real life but the difference is that my brain kind of knows where everything is so it's like I'll know what everything looks like even though my vision isn't better I'll know where everything's placed and it's all already mapped in my head so it's like intuitively just knowing where stuff is which is cool also I am able to hear things the same way and I haven't mastered lucid dreaming I'm trying to that would be awesome if I could just control my dreams change them up make you know fly like I was able to do that once where I dreamed that I was in an airplane and the top came off kind of like in that dream really yes we're going up and down some mountains in the top it was like a convertible airplane yeah and it was like on clouds they were like cotton candy from the circus oh wow it was just kind of floating on clouds and the top of it opened and then I sort of was like I wonder what what would happen if I jumped out yeah without being scared jumped out and I put my hands out to my sides and I was just floating and flying around the plane and along the clouds sitting on them and floating on clouds it was awesome that was the only time I was able to control it but mm I'm working on it dream journals their thing yeah I'm trying to get that not wet dreams they have wet dreams and if you're blind if you have the did they have I don't do women even have wet dreams oh yeah I would say so I mean yeah that's a thing it it happens once in a while like when you either don't expect it or if you really like somebody yeah it just like it comes up or a lot of the times what used to happen for me as a teenager is like it would be like some burning building or something crazy like out of Terminator and then the random guy would show up and be like do you want to live or you want to die let's go yeah you know and then just go from there and then I'd wake up like just as I was getting into their car I was like what the hell really why is this happening why do I have to wake up right now yeah oh yeah yeah I've had some like that yeah I mean not with the guy but with a woman you know right yeah what else do we have here we got one more video question let's do and honestly this was probably sent in by 12 different people this from Andy Ferguson yo what's good Theo this is your boy Andy up in Portland Oregon what's up Andy I had a question for Tanja or Tanya it's a soft J it's a question that has kept me up many a nights just wondering how do you know when you're done wiping gang gang okay so I guess that's a if you're going to the bathroom if you're you know if you go into the bathroom how do you know when you're done wiping your body that's kind of like the question where people ask when you're in the shower how do you see to shower right right it was like you keep your eyes closed and you shower anyway yeah it's it's one of those things where you can just like you use a bunch of toilet paper and then if you're still not you know if you're still not clean then you get a boudet set right yeah and you just use that on your toilet and you're good and it's actually cleaner and you use less toilet paper yeah but but no it's like seriously yeah you just you just wipe everything a couple times and you make sure it's not uncomfortable and if it's not you're good yeah and you move on and yeah do a couple extra swabs on deck you know I feel you just like anybody else would do yeah don't just do one time I don't care who you are please don't yeah you don't want to get stuck on the hairy you know yeah yeah you got to tighten it up do you feel like I'm wondering was sex very scary since you were side impaired like was that something that was it was just kind of regular no it was one of those things where it was like oh I'm gonna try this now let's do it yeah and you know it's it's the same again with with like anything else you got to communicate about everything yeah and just be upfront and it can be really awkward for sure when you're like it's your first time or whatever and you're trying to learn your own preferences and things it can be really awkward but you you've got to find ways to make things less awkward to play games I don't know you like maybe you do some role playing down the line just to make things fun you know keep things fun and you you have if you're not into it you just got to be honest be like hey dude not today I'm good yeah yeah yeah yeah communication mm-hmm you know it's funny the longer that we sit here they'll let the just forgot that you were blind for a second nice that's pretty crazy and I don't know it just like yeah I don't know what for some reason it was just like I don't know just second ago I just totally forgot about it not that it matters not that I was thinking the whole time oh you know time you can't see yeah on your side impaired but I just forgot it yeah well no it's like a tiny person or tiny part of who I am and it doesn't doesn't obviously make up anyone's identity is just a obstacle or I mean you could think of it as an obstacle or just a part of you that you live with and you adapt life to but it's not really who you are like your personality everyone's personality is blind is different from the others and although there are similarities in our experiences like finding shoppers at stores and getting very vague information on everything or the whole experience where people start helping you and you can tell after five minutes they're just like oh you can ask me about one more thing please just go away yeah because you need more information right you have a lot of questions you do yes like you need to know what brand it is what the size is you know if you're looking at shoes for example what other styles they carry and do they have them in your size you want to feel everything in the store which people just get oh that's pretty wild like no please don't do that yeah that's like a pervert at a ah that's like Gianni when he goes to one of those bunny ranches nice you know he just wants to feel everything in the store like a sex store Nick was all the things you and Nick at Nick was also premature baby I don't know I didn't know that so yeah I was a two pound preemie oh wow yeah and Nick came in I think he's ready to wrestle would you come in that night I was in I was I was pretty heavy I was in that four to six pound ring they called him big Nick around the incubators you know yeah so that's um a last question after you is is your sight impairment is it in your eyes or is it in your brain oh that's a good one because cortical visual impairment is now the leading cause of blindness in the US that's what I was thinking yeah I'm joking I have no I have no idea what you're talking about oh it's a processing issue where that is that would be classified as a brain issue where your brain is just unable to make sense of the images it gets from your eyes so so there is that that's a leading cause now but no mine has nothing to do with the way my brain processes anything it's it is related to my optic nerve which connects my eyes to my brain and a lot of the strands on those have deteriorated the more they deteriorate due to glaucoma the less I'm able to perceive which is why my field of vision is so low like it's it's like looking through a TP tube yeah you just see directly what's in ahead of you the funny thing about that is though when people run across my path like in front of me or they step in front of me to me it looks like they just appeared out of thin air like they're not there and then they're there and I'm like whoa so everyone your neighbors is like David Blaine yeah that's so interesting um do you feel like you have a different insider relationship with like a higher power because you have because of your impairment no I wouldn't say I'm not really religious so but even like spiritual like do you feel like even in your spirit like do you feel like oh that's a good question I would say because I'm so fascinated with the supernatural in general I feel like I can pick up if there is residual energy or spirit activity or something I used to do as a hobby like in paranormal investigation hell yeah you did yeah it was so much fun it was so much fun and and and this will take us into you want to tell yeah just before we get out of here we'd like to hear about your two shows yeah yeah specifically yeah yeah so I'll mention vast horizon okay which is done by full and scholar productions Caitlyn and Travis are super talented as a team and they also created the white vault which I encourage you to check out but this is creeping horror like this starts out where it sets up the story in the characters and it's this agronomist who wakes up on this what agronomist and what is that like she's a scientist she studies plants and such okay so plant person mm-hmm so she wakes up on a on a colony ship and she wakes up alone like she's got a tube down her throat and she's like oh my god I'm dying wakes up the medical computer gives her some basic info and then she realizes that there are no bodies no one else is on board she's the only one alive on the ship that she knows of and gets out of the med bay tries to figure it out no lights only emergency auxiliary lights are on and she starts making contact with the ships AI I get to play the AI which for me is amazing I love it because I'm so obsessed with artificial intelligence and I have a like an Alexa at home and everything whoops sorry guys if I set off your devices here that's okay we don't have anything I mean she's the listeners the listeners oh that's great oh I used to go on the radio and blow a dog whistle all the time nice and change the whole frickin's town dude that's great yeah it's pretty good so that sounds pretty fascinating somebody wakes up on a ship and nobody else is there yes exactly and she needs to survive okay and it tells her story through flashback you find out how she ended up there and what her mission is and there are many critical things on the ship that she needs to take care of including the incubators you know the baby is in the nursery and it just gets steadily creepier there will be a couple seasons and this is all over audio right yeah this is on vastrisen.libson.com and the white vault.libson.com you can also find it on Himalaya which is an app where which allows you to stream podcasts you can listen to and we'll put the links at the we'll put the links in the information so people can check them out sweet can you feel when like people are looking at you sometimes it feels kind of like the hair on the back of my neck stands up mm-hmm you know it does that tell you that we have like a unique energy that is like used through our eyes like is there's something like I yeah you think of your eyes just as intakeors but they're really I think it's that that like your energy is focused on me so I can tell mm-hmm that you're like directly engaged or looking at me directly I don't know how to put it except you feel watched so it's yeah it's kind of like when you watch any ghost paranormal investigation show like paranormal state you know mm-hmm ghost yeah I'm blanking on the the taps team there oh I blanked on everything yeah Jesus Christ so you kind of you feel like that sense of someone is there they're they're watching you mm-hmm man it sounds and now it just seems so interesting to be blind because now you get to live in like this constant like horror novel or anything that happens everything is kind of hunting you it's just such a I'm out here with all this color and all no you know it's just just kind of milling around with all this frickin you know just information that's not really as fascinating sometimes I mean it is but I think what it is I don't mean that in a bad way I mean it in the sense that it's like I forget about my other senses as much like I think yeah just being sense lazy like I forget about like if I had to close my eyes and sit some more for a while and just smell or just hear mm-hmm like what would I even pick up about the world that I'm in try it try it it's a lot of fun they have actually a five senses museum exhibit in one of the museums in Denver actually they had that recently it was cool you know we really need is if you went and sat somewhere like in a specific place like in the world right mm-hmm and you did a thing where you just like you told people like as an audio tape you told people like all the sounds that were there and so then someone could go sit in the same place and just notice them yeah because that's a thing like I wouldn't even probably notice until someone said hey do you hear you're like oh wow that is crazy I didn't even know what that you know I think it could just you might be able to be like a liaison kind of into like a like a sound sherpa kind of you know we could take us up in like a you know just kind of enough just recognizing that that sounds going on around us a lot of times yeah absolutely you can do that with any kind of like there are apps that will help you I don't identify bird calls mm-hmm that's a big hobby oh yeah a lot of like a warbler to you like them yeah a warbler yeah yeah they're kind of cool well something you don't like them really so so about it yeah yeah yeah I guess I'm I mean I don't like them that much but I do like them that but yeah but but there there are so many ways to do that I mean there's an app called vision sim which will simulate different visual conditions like retinopathy prematurity diabetic retinopathy etc and the camera will you look through your camera at objects and you'll see them to the degree you want to imply to apply that visual impairment so you can adjust the slider to a hundred percent which is total to zero percent mm-hmm so try it out it's free it's made by the Braille Institute and it's on the eye are the Apple Store what I'm saying the app store I will check it out I will and we'll put the link to that as well tell you we just want to thank you so much for being here and join us today and and yeah I'm curious to check out some of your your voiceover work thank you and and just I don't know continue to have your voice in my ears sometimes oh absolutely I really appreciate this opportunity and thank you so much for having me on the show yeah thank you just for being so candid and just I really feel like I'll just I kind of learned a lot I feel like and and I'm grateful for you for being willing to let me learn you know and not be in judgmental you know and you and you're a super you had some wonderful questions so I appreciate your your ability to ask some thought-provoking things I hadn't thought of either well communication right like you just said thank you so much thank you now I'm just on the breeze and I feel I'm falling like these leaves I must be cornerstone but when I reach that ground I'll share this piece of mind I found I can feel it in my bones but it's gonna take a little time for me to set that parking brake and let myself on my now",
