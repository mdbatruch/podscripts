really think that this is\"},{\"currTime\":817,\"text\":\"going to de-escalate things and I don't think yeah that these kind of blood\"},{\"currTime\":828,\"text\":\"thirsty journalists are interested in de-escalating no and I think like the\"},{\"currTime\":834,\"text\":\"sanctions thing like it's really like the jury's out it's like an open question\"},{\"currTime\":837,\"text\":\"as to whether it will turn Russian people en masse against Putin like he has\"},{\"currTime\":842,\"text\":\"something like a 70 percent approval rating which I would take with a grain\"},{\"currTime\":845,\"text\":\"of salt that's very very dubious I doubt that there's no way to know what\"},{\"currTime\":850,\"text\":\"Putin's approval rating is but I've asked so you know I've asked like Russian\"},{\"currTime\":854,\"text\":\"friends what kind of the climate is over there and what people's impressions are\"},{\"currTime\":861,\"text\":\"and of course kind of the

like\"},{\"currTime\":875,\"text\":\"everyday Russians a lot of them are probably pro-Putin's actions in Ukraine\"},{\"currTime\":882,\"text\":\"you think and I think some of them are for sure yeah and I think a lot of them\"},{\"currTime\":885,\"text\":\"don't care so much and are mainly concerned with the way that the\"},{\"currTime\":889,\"text\":\"sanctions will impact their livelihoods I think that's the first thing\"},{\"currTime\":893,\"text\":\"that people think of in any well the idea is like this is yeah is that things\"},{\"currTime\":897,\"text\":\"will get so dire that they will revolt against Putin yeah and there's hold him\"},{\"currTime\":902,\"text\":\"accountable right yeah yeah and but there's an argument the anti-woke film\"},{\"currTime\":906,\"text\":\"festival but there's an argument to be made that actually sanctions imposed by\"},{\"currTime\":913,\"text\":\"an external power unite and galvanize people against that external oppressor\"},{\"currTime\":917,\"text\":\"and strengthen the local government because yeah yeah people feel like\"},{\"currTime\":925,\"text\":\"they're hated and targeted and no one likes feeling that way especially if\"},{\"currTime\":929,\"text\":\"you're like an innocent Russian who has nothing to do with anything is just\"},{\"currTime\":933,\"text\":\"going about your business who is suffering from us you and impose\"},{\"currTime\":936,\"text\":\"sanctions so due to a war that they did not want and have no pardon yeah I mean\"},{\"currTime\":946,\"text\":\"besides being Russian yeah and you see how like kind of like nasty and punitive\"},{\"currTime\":951,\"text\":\"it gets like those Russians with attitude guys were tweeting about how

that's just nasty like a power move it just like a fuck you yeah\"},{\"currTime\":986,\"text\":\"and I think the other thing with sanctions that you have to keep in mind is\"},{\"currTime\":989,\"text\":\"that they're a highly visible and low-cost method of like stunting on your\"},{\"currTime\":1001,\"text\":\"enemy from the perspective of the of the country doing the or the organization\"},{\"currTime\":1006,\"text\":\"doing the imposing right yeah so it's all I mean it all feels like virtue\"},{\"currTime\":1012,\"text\":\"signaling maybe Ostrovsky and Tracy

know military strategy right which eludes me as well as like lots of people posting maps of Ukraine as if I'm supposed to discern something like what's going on there's like little arrows and like tank and some parts are red and some people are saying yeah that Russia is just crushing and leveling Kiev which from some of the videos I've seen does seem to be the totally devastating case then some people are saying that the Ukrainians are like mercilessly slaughtering the Russian soldiers there was some Belarusophobia I saw that yeah I saw you chipping out on the TL I was so upset I couldn't handle it yeah dude it's upsetting I I for one I'm looking forward to my first brush with Russophobia so I can you know go and cry about it I feel like I feel like how you know Muslims must have felt when Trump did the Muslim ban yeah except you know never mind never mind I'm not gonna finish that sentence but I saw this Swedish guy named Anders Ostlund who lives in Kiev because he's clearly a sex tourist I thought you're gonna say like some intelligence operative but sex tourists is probably more probably why not both probably both probably both and he said one way to wake Belarusians up might unfortunately be to destroy Belarusian troops in the field once coffins start coming home to Belarus it might wake up the 90% who didn't protest in Minsk in 2020 then maybe Belarus will really rise against Lukashenko and exit the war my question is why are all of these people like calling for like Russians and Belarusians to protest you can't do that shit over there I mean you can but they'll literally like Belarus especially down a prison sentence a Swedish some sick Swedish fuck yeah thinks he has a position from which to tell Belarusian people to try and overthrow their regime which they've been under for 30 years yeah basically well and it's crazy because this guy ostensibly has kind of like the knowledge and information advantage because he lives in Kiev you know but I realized that with a lot of these people like they'll be up in there like you know embedded in a war zone or like filing their little articles and they actually like in spite of their like wealth of factual knowledge don't know anything yeah yeah and their blood thirsty yeah well that's natural I feel like the this latest conflict has really brought out people's bloodlust and of course they love war people love war that's Lindy people love yeah it is Lindy it's Lindy to love war and I was thinking like there's a Susan Sontag quote that's like war is terrible and it is normal and like how quickly war becomes normal is with one of the things that's the most terrible about it makes me horny here's another one from from our friend Anders who I will destroy he said maybe the best way to motivate the Russian the Russian people is to sanction the country so hard that they all lose their jobs maybe then they will miss their iPhones Mercedes and sushi bars so much that they will actually protest against Putin in large numbers these people always tell on themselves too it's like when Jen Psaki was like okay have a margarita and go to your kickboxing class it's always like they're gonna miss their lattes and iPhones and sushi bars and yeah once these shitty nasty Russians finally do something to stop their corrupt government once we take their ginsu away yeah so the Russophobia Anna well the people that care about those things those hoes ain't loyal already yeah they're not gonna be taken rootless cosmopolitan exactly exactly like they have no love for Putin and that's our prerogative I'm not get me maybe a coke zero or something out of our this is the perk of maybe in the podcasting there is not that you're gonna have to settle with the room temp yeah yeah but like one of the perks of potting from this office which we've never done before is that there is coke zero on top which feels great and that's a business expense mm-hmm yeah but I think like Russians have historically fulfilled the role of like like they you know Russophobia is like sanctioned racism against white people there's sort of like you know typically that role is fulfilled by Italians mm-hmm in American culture but I think Russians are an even better target because they're more foreign and illegible you know yeah like I think they're probably scary to Americans they're more Eastern yeah and yet so similar similar to Americans and Americans are obsessed with them right well arguably they're just like the alternate universe they're like the the yin to the yang well yeah it's I mean I think what I've surmised from people that I know in Russia or people who know people in Russia is that yeah Putin is like is D platforming kind of non-state and sank sanctioned right media orgs and stuff like echo and dorshed where I was getting a lot of my news back when there was like the the election Belarus last year or however long ago it was but then when I'm I was watching like an echo video on on YouTube yesterday and there was it's obviously nowhere near as bad as it is in Russia but even here like much like there was with COVID there's these like little disclaimers that are like this is from a Russian site like yeah or like get click here to get the real the real-estate sanctioned intel or whatever well now it's not a full-on like suppression of the press but there I mean we banned our president from Twitter right our democratically elected president Mr. Donald Trump from Twitter yeah and how is that less heinous than what Putin is doing to the media at least yeah I mean it's not and also like I sent you that the cursory doc I made a dog and I made a dog because yeah because there was a lot of oh wait is there a cup holder sick yeah you're in a full camping chair yeah the the doc of well it's interesting yeah that the our pod is called Red Scare yeah and now we're in the midst of a little bit of a real I actually bled through my Red Scare Los Angeles apparel sweatpants and I was like no that's yeah no I said I made a really kind of spotty and shitty doc that is by no means comprehensive of all like the kind of cultural institutions that are like boycotting Russian companies and sources the BDS of yeah of Russia yeah and it's like Nike and Apple Facebook Disney Disney plus pulled Anastasia off of its streaming platform which is not a Disney film okay it's a 20th century Fox film but then I read that they had sort of planned to do that anyway and it was just of course sort of a coincidence like the doctor sees thing like it was like yeah I think there's a lot of that going you know I saw also people being like Tarkovsky was taken off the IMDb like or like come and see was taken off like the real IMDb list of 250 best films or something for reals but I think that also has to do maybe less with like IMDb proper than people like down voting it or what you know there's there's there's lots of factors at play it's really it's much like the war in Ukraine it's really really hard and confusing and upsetting to know like what is actually going on and who is to blame and who but yeah so like the big ones MSC and Marisk which are kind of shipping giants they suspended container shipping to and from Russia Boeing and Airbus have stopped so where is where are people gonna get all our other sex slaves if they're not putting them in those shipping containers I don't know I mean I'm sorry to keep invoking sex tourism but yeah Ukraine and Eastern Europe much like Southeast Asia is also a hub for sex trafficking yeah so so it's like another incentive for all these amateur war hawks and independent journalists to parachute themselves into the war zone should we go cuz they're well you know that Michael Tracy announced that he's en route to Poland a Strafsky's in Poland our previous guy that makes sense and I've been texting him a bit because because I really was like you really think these sanctions are are right you really think that this is going to de-escalate things and I don't think yeah that these kind of blood thirsty journalists are interested in de-escalating no and I think like the sanctions thing like it's really like the jury's out it's like an open question as to whether it will turn Russian people en masse against Putin like he has something like a 70 percent approval rating which I would take with a grain of salt that's very very dubious I doubt that there's no way to know what Putin's approval rating is but I've asked so you know I've asked like Russian friends what kind of the climate is over there and what people's impressions are and of course kind of the liberal Western leaning upper middle-class people in Moscow and St. Petersburg or like almost unanimously anti-war and but I think like everyday Russians a lot of them are probably pro-Putin's actions in Ukraine you think and I think some of them are for sure yeah and I think a lot of them don't care so much and are mainly concerned with the way that the sanctions will impact their livelihoods I think that's the first thing that people think of in any well the idea is like this is yeah is that things will get so dire that they will revolt against Putin yeah and there's hold him accountable right yeah yeah and but there's an argument the anti-woke film festival but there's an argument to be made that actually sanctions imposed by an external power unite and galvanize people against that external oppressor and strengthen the local government because yeah yeah people feel like they're hated and targeted and no one likes feeling that way especially if you're like an innocent Russian who has nothing to do with anything is just going about your business who is suffering from us you and impose sanctions so due to a war that they did not want and have no pardon yeah I mean besides being Russian yeah and you see how like kind of like nasty and punitive it gets like those Russians with attitude guys were tweeting about how like the something called like the International Feline Federation I'm translating from French it like they banned Russian breadcats from being imported or registered in their pedigree book or entered into any one of their competitions and Russia apparently I did not know this has the highest share of cat owners of any country in the world that's cute it's cute but it's you know that's just like that's just nasty like a power move it just like a fuck you yeah and I think the other thing with sanctions that you have to keep in mind is that they're a highly visible and low-cost method of like stunting on your enemy from the perspective of the of the country doing the or the organization doing the imposing right yeah so it's all I mean it all feels like virtue signaling maybe Ostrovsky and Tracy can meet in Poland and like duel it out they can start a podcast over there bushkin or the element of style yeah so what else Russian commercial flights have been banned over Canadian and European air space mm-hmm yeah well like meaning that you can't I don't think that you can fly to Canada or to many countries in Europe if you're if you have a Russian passport that's what I'm assuming and you probably can't fly into Russia a lot yeah and I think like airflow like a lot of the kind of suppliers so we just daddass can't go to Russia we can't which is you know like you know I I can't go see my family I know I know I'm like very upset about that I mean obviously like I said it pales in comparison to anything going on in you know I'm very even Belarus but yeah that shit is like heartbreaking to me because my dad's whole family is in Moscow most of them are like getting on in age my plan was to take Lenny over there after he turned one to meet his family members that's clearly not happening anytime soon I haven't even I mean yeah it's my gorgeous busty cousins are upset yeah Masha just had her like second baby I haven't even met her first baby I it's it's I yeah yesterday I was really just having kind of the intrusive thought that the worst is is yet to come yeah I think so too and that is devastating and the the situation in Ukraine is horrible but hey congratulations on your sag award congratulations on my on my sag award I did see some people speculating that I was on cocaine or suffering from autism up on stage due to my expressive face did you just dissociate I would dissociate I right before I got on stage will Smith looked me in the eyes and said congratulations and that really shook me cuz I can't couldn't believe that I was it was surreal yeah I was I was I mean I was legitimately overjoyed yeah I was exuberantly happy and I'm very proud to be represent part of the cast of succession I was gonna say represent the Slavic peoples yeah well that too that too that too that a girl from the dirt of Belarus could have such a monument as yeah achievement yeah it was moving to me especially I mean when I was like a struggling actress in Los Angeles who wasn't even in sag I remember looking at like the sag after building and looking at their little like logo which is like this little actor guy being like that is just like that this man torments me and I like will never make it in this business you know I'm like I'm doomed to be just like crushed and punished by like the spirit of the time so it was but did you watch the the acceptance speech that Brian Cox my colleague made I watched it with the sound off because I never turn the sound on videos when I look at my phone I've like literally never watched a video with the sound on I also watch all the Ukrainian combat videos with the sound you don't want to hear that I don't want to hear that but Brian Cox did make a statement of solidarity with the people in Ukraine which he was he was right to do he also pointed out that Zelensky was was an actor and he said and we respect that for him and we do I mean that's yeah and then people were kind of being like oh these actors they just make everything about themselves and they think they're so important and guess what it's the sag awards yeah it's for actors by actors it's the screen actors guild where they're to talk about acting yeah we do think acting is important we do think it's the oldest profession and besides the other one though they certainly overlap yeah they're very related in a way no but it's so stupid and gay to like aren't we past the point now of mocking actors for whatever a certain like perceived faux pause because I mean what's the argument that he wasn't sensitive enough to the geopolitical situation no that he that's no that he just was like well then he spoke specifically about actors in Russia who are being blacklisted essentially for speaking out against the war in Ukraine or which is true it's true a lot of celebrities and public figures in Russia have like openly turned against Putin yeah yeah and you know are being are being faced as Brian said with like the threat of high trees and for doing so and you know as actors we are concerned with actors so and he has the authority to speak on that because he has worked with like the Moscow theater over the course of his long career and I I stand with Brian I mean I love Brian Cox because didn't he he didn't he come out against cancel culture and also he famously played a pedophile in one of the best movies ever so he's made some gutsy and brazen he's a great Scotsman incredible Shakespearean actor yeah but when I was on stage truly not strategically placed where I was I really was there because I was hugging Scott Nicholson who plays Brian Cox's bodyguard who I'm very at the cop that's the cop yeah who I've spoken about before I'm very close to and love a lot and I thought it was you know amazing that he and I both and him especially we're up there because he's been on the show for three seasons he's on the show a lot he doesn't get a lot of speaking parts because he does play a bodyguard but he is part of the ensemble and he is a strong part of the ensemble but when when people remarked on how quickly my facial expression changed when Brian Cox started to talk about Ukraine and Russia that was partly ironically was because I was told prior to going on the red carpet by one of my handlers that if I were to be asked about Ukraine to under no circumstances say anything so part of what was happening with me was I was just sort of you know registering the irony of speaking out against Russian actors being blacklisted for speaking their truth about Ukraine when here in America in Hollywood there is not with this situation in particular so far but there is certainly tons of black listing and things that actors are not allowed to say under threat of not high treason but of just like obliterating their careers right well in the process is a lot more opaque and unofficial like in Russia if you're you know an actor presenter any sort of celebrity you speak out against the government it is understood that the retribution is handed down from a single source right even though it might be enforced by your particular institution here there we live it's a very Soviet situation because we live by diktat like nobody enforces anything nothing is formalized but you can be canceled if you will yeah by you know if you run your mouth and like it's also an open question whether any of the kind of institutions or organizations canceling you even have the authority to do so yeah but you know here we are here we are so yeah I think it's like you know different equally shitty systems that's the other that's the other thing you know like I'm not pro-Putin and in fact I always been kind of repulsed by and mistrustful of Putin of course Putin's a fucking corrupt yeah and I you know I agree with everybody who's come out and said like yeah okay he he is a criminal and he's corrupt but you know that's besides the point that can't be like the first line of logic or reasoning when you're looking to understand his position primarily so you can refute it right or challenge it but also like you know you have to give credit where it's due and in the 90s in the early 2000s he made a gambit with the oligarchs and sort of then went and turned on them and purged this these kind of sources of corruption that were like literally plundering the state sent them packing and I think what he did was institutionalize the corruption so he's like the sole vector like he and his chosen like Silovki or whatever but in doing so he really established a decent livelihood for a lot of people in the country in Russia yeah and you can't deny that like I think in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union they experienced probably like the highest fall in life expectancy that anyone has ever recorded and yeah I mean it was literally the original deaths of despair yeah we did it first we did it first now we're doing it again yeah USA style yeah and Russians always do everything first and better we're like tastemakers and pioneers amen says I just I want the war to end and I don't have this strategic militaristic mind to know about how to do that I just literally I'm crying and praying for the war to be over so that life can go on with not so much suffering yeah and that's all really really all I all I want we are not pro-boot and yeah and I mean I think like Ostrowski as much as I disagree with his reasoning and his conclusions did make one very salient I mean he made many but he made one salient point which is like you can't underestimate Ukraine's agency in this what is that it's the radiator sorry some ambient some ASMR I can turn that off maybe give it a shot well the Ukrainians have you know as Ostrowski said nationalism has increased yeah in Ukraine they do have a right to be sovereign if that is what they want well yeah but they also made a gambit knowingly and willingly that may or may not backfire just like Russia made a gambit knowingly and willingly that may or may not backfire because I think Putin really did probably bank on the fact that it would be like a clean assault like in and out and now there I don't know if they're mired or overextended or if it's you know turning into Afghanistan I doubt it is I think like the reports of Ukrainian victory and glory are probably way overplayed and I think that the Russians are advancing at an alarming rate you think that yeah probably I mean they're just like the superior arm I don't know I don't know I don't know but if I had to put my money on that just like strictly technically I would say that the Russians are probably winning and things will probably turn out less favorably for the Ukrainians and the Russians though who knows but the Ukrainians did make this they figured they could make this bargain which was that they would rather be under the thumb of the US than under the thumb of Russia and that would mean accepting certain economic and political reforms and certain cultural reforms that were like liberalizing and they but NATO said today they're not going to enforce the no-fly zone well they yeah they because they shouldn't they shouldn't yeah yeah and also this no-fly zone is like a figment of like I bear like I don't even know what I don't even know what a no-fly zone is I mean it would mean that US and NATO militaries could shoot down Russian planes or Ukraine which would literally lead to nuclear war but that's what they want that is what they want I'm a pacifist y'all y'all folks we don't want it we don't want it I don't want yeah I don't want Ukrainians Belarusians Russians I don't want any Slavic person in a coffin yeah I don't want it and I mean that's the other thing that I would also say like I don't want people's lives to be destabilized I don't want that's what people on the West do not understand they don't care they don't care first of all they don't even they didn't even know what Belarus was yeah tell maybe a couple years ago a lot of them still probably don't but could you locate Guam on a map mm-hmm two weeks ago but they don't understand that people might not want liberal democracy at any cost right there are costs to overthrowing a regime that are not always worth it for the people who live in those countries because they've already suffered enough yeah yeah and I think like well okay that's that's I saw Eli Lake was tweeting he said there's Eli Lake he's that guy that does those cartoons no that's Eli Valley okay poor Eli Kessler said to me the other day I hate that there's all these guys who share my name yeah you are I and Talia are like the worst drew names the worst drew names yeah so Eli Lake was like a saber rattling and warmongering yesterday he said there's a temptation to engage China to further isolate Russia this will not work we are in a new Cold War China and Russia are allies they're out to get us the West needs to understand that we're out to get them to and never mind like the kind of narcissism of thinking China and Russia are out to get you it's like don't flatter yourself they're just serving their own national interests they're not like horny for war like you are yeah but also like the idea Americans are horny for a war that they don't have to fight right well it's always that yeah and Russians are horny for war well Putin's whole denazification thing yeah is bogus well he's I think he's trolling the the Jews who are bankrolling I think he's maybe trolling a little bit I think he's a little delusional yeah I when I was visiting my parents in February my dad actually was lamenting to me how so much of like contemporary Russian cinema is so preoccupied with World War two yeah and like the heroism of Russia in World War two and I think I don't know not living there but my my thinking is is that I think a lot of yeah the very prominent ideology in Russia it does have to do with this like World War two to nostalgia yes and the the narrative denazification is sort of harkening harkening back to that and and that that that has been something that has been going on in Russia for some time yeah and he's definitely making like establishing a symbolic lineage between World War two Euro-Russians as denazifiers and World War three Russians as denazifiers for the future but I really do think he's like also trolling Zelensky his sponsor Columnskoy who's like this Jewish billionaire you know not an oligarch just a billionaire just they're oligarchs if we don't like them they're billionaires yeah yeah yeah true if you're a billionaire you can keep your super yacht if you're an oligarch there's yeah well I Peter Teals and oligarch apparently oh yeah yeah yeah that makes sense yeah but because he's not we have our non grata we have our own all oligarchs but I think like you know I was saying this earlier I feel like the somewhat incredulous response that everybody in the West had to this invasion it totally gels with like their kind of Fukuyama and whatever post-historical approach to history because the Western ruling class the political establishment they really buy into this idea that this economic interdependence that you create through free trade and open borders will keep all countries you know locked in a matrix and keep them in line because it's it's not only like a powerful deterrent against non-compliance but it's also a huge incentive for compliance like they assume that everybody wants to buy into their like GDP based vision of the world and it doesn't occur to them like Nicolo said in his article on sub-stack which was one of the best breakdowns of the situation that I read that like for Russia Ukraine is an existential matter whereas for America it's merely an asset so like a decline in GDP is the price they're willing to pay right and all of these things you know reputation GDP like immigration opportunities don't have as much purchase for them by which I mean the the the political class in Russia not the ordinary people necessarily so I mean it remind it like speaking of Peter teal I love when we're doing the docket and things just like dovetail nicely but it reminded me of his like flash of civilizations argument in a Straussian moment which is an essay that I love and recommend that everybody read it's good and I recommend that you read it in tandem with zero to one because they're so blatantly like mutually exclusive but anyway in that essay Peter teal talks about the the question of like Western civilizational decline and the fact that the West is too kind of a feat and enfeebled to pose a true threat to true believers and he cites the example of like Islamic terrorism which we know now is not the big threat that it was made out to be by you know people like Bush and Obama but he he's talking about how like basically the West stands for nothing and doesn't believe in anything so it can't really enforce this free market consensus because it's unwilling to do what it takes which is use force and incur casualties in like a like open manner like Putin did where he invaded yeah but what does Putin believe in besides his own that's a good question I don't it's not I don't think I'm not convinced that he is the kind of ethno-nationalist ideal log that he's billing himself as now no because like also the thing to remember about Putin the main thing to remember is that he is a spy which means that he's in the business of telling people what they want to hear yeah and he's like if you do you know if you look at his recent like rhetorical turns he does sound I mean I just think the casualties to him as a brutal corrupt man are inconsequential and I don't think that it is that he you know he believes in something so much that he's willing to make sacrifices I think that he is probably driven you know egoically by power mm-hmm and the casualties are just of no consequence to him yeah but I think like he's willing to incur the disfavor and ex communication of like the free world the global community to achieve his goals which I don't think are static like they're also dynamic because he couldn't know in advance what exactly the situation would be in Ukraine and how much of it he can write off right well yeah and much like he is invoking the denazification the narrative of a package hello I think it's hi hi oh thank you thank you hey do you want to weigh in he seemed Chinese so are Russia and China actually allies or are they frenemies that was nice of him to bring the package and sorry what was I saying oh yes right right much like Putin is invoking denazification in this hearkening back to World War two in the West they're sort of painting Putin as this like contemporary like Hitler figure did you see the was a time magazine the cover where it was like his face and the it was like a trump how do you you know like it's like an art history term tromploi yeah tromploi type thing we're like you if you tear off the paper it's like a Hitler mustache I thought that that cover was actually an example of like really good design okay it was like very very impactful I wonder if I could find it Putin time magazine sorry keep going I don't know God have mercy on us honestly oh the this yes it's a really like cool cover it's like him with the Hitler mustache but it's being like torn off to reveal their most and it says and and the head graphically it's it's graphically very strong which is not not what I'm used to with conceptually it's a little lazy but yes but graphically I think it's the best we can hope for and and then the headline is the return of history which is you know a little nod to Fukuyama there yeah yeah yeah so I thought that was a strong showing from time magazine but they would Hitler yeah putler yeah well when he you know when Putin came on the scene I think Ostrovsky was right about this he was he was much more non ideological and he cared a lot more what people thought of him mm-hmm and I've never I've never you know pegged to Putin to be a particularly ideological person but he does have like a stable of consistent like sources that he cites that are very ethno-nationalist and interested in like restoring the glory I mean Russia's been trying to restore the glory of Russia forever yeah yeah they were I'm what are we on they want it to be the third room we're now on like the fifth or sixth room it's like the waves of feminism 40th wave glory yeah though I have a dumb question though maybe somebody can can answer it maybe I can answer yeah no I mean your guess is as good as anybody else's honestly I think like a lot of these like longs and experts know not what they speak of yeah but let me see if I wrote it down but I don't know if I can even find it it's okay a lot of people whose analysis I more or less trust on the topic like Nicola have said like he said Russia's nightmare scenario is getting dismembered from the West but then there's also an understanding that Russia is actively creating a block of influence that's independent of the West ie by allying with China trying to get ahead of sanctions that sort of thing and I'm curious like how those two things gel in Putin's mind you know what I'm saying because if his worst fear is getting bleostracized canceled whatever from the West but his greatest ambition well this is you know what Nicola is surmising I mean certainly like economically and politically it's a nightmare we want the Jinsa yeah they want blue jeans yeah but on the other hand sushi he is sushi sushi sushi he's obviously an ambitious man with a Napoleon complex maybe and he clearly does want to create a challenge to the global homo order mm-hmm like why else would he do something so aggressive and unfathomable yeah like he really pulled the plug you know yeah I mean the question is is that is that challenge is that alternative to the global homo order right really better mm-hmm which I died out or really all that different all that well yeah yeah yeah because ultimately American cultural hegemony will reign on even I think it already had yeah yeah even if America gets weaker kind of economically and geopolitically which it has the culture is strong yeah yeah and yeah nobody like nobody wants to be Chinese or Russian so maybe some people want to do want to be Russian maybe it's time for for Russia to take its rightful place as the superior culture I mean my hot take was it wasn't someone pulling Dostoevsky out of like curriculum in Italy or something yes I'm some university in Milan some stupid whop was and they I think they fired the conductor of like Morinsky theater or something some opera singers bar from the from the the mat but like my hot take as an art her story in is that Russia has a comparable and equally strong artistic legacy to that of the West I would say stronger yeah they have all those wooden churches made without nails all the equine mm-hmm which we've grown to love yeah what what's that look no no no yeah I agree they have literature portraiture the most grand chess grandmasters in chess yeah the theater I wonder what Gary Kasparov is up to invented naturalism speaking of actors yeah Stanislavsky change the game before that every actor suck I'm looking at the vulture piece I sent you of the the cultural institutions boycott ingrussian involvement formula one and its contract with the Russian Grand Prix Spotify closed its Russian offices indefinitely live nation is canceling which is like a touring thing canceling dates Glasgow Film Festival dropped two Russian films from its lineup met opera will no longer engage with artists or institutions that support Putin are supported by him Carnegie Hall canceled performances by some Russians FIFA bands Russian teams ahead of the World Cup in Qatar what oh Qatar so it will call it but it's actually pronounced Qatar oh yeah which I learned when I had a layover there that's fucking crazy yeah international judo Federation Taekwondo strip Putin of his honors I bet that's like for him Venice Biennale Venice Biennale removes the Russian pavilion Ukraine pavilion response Eurovision Eurovision bars Russia from competing European Film Academy prohibits Russian films from the European Film Awards can bands Russian delegations pending on the outcome of the war Eurovision is just so cruel that's the hardest that's gonna be a tough pill that's raw and this is all that might be the yeah cats in the Eurovision yeah that might get them just the audacity to tell people to be protesting in a country that you don't fucking live in and don't know what it's like to live in and don't know what it's like to be beaten by Russian Belarusian police forces and I have so much contempt for these kind of like also like if feet and enfeebled institutions like the Venice Biennale fuck the Venice Biennale isn't that where all those people like a dock collapsed and they all fell into the water and it was actually like it looked like a beautiful it was like the raft of the Medusas and then it looked like a beautiful historical painting it was like a bunch of people with like a lanyard's oh I don't know and like clip boards I don't know falling into the water I'd like to show a film there one day but I'm doesn't seem to seem likely where at the Venice wait I thought the Venice Biennale with it's like an art event right no it's a film oh the film festival okay but there's an art event called the Venice Biennale maybe maybe I might think yeah as well yeah yeah no it's ridiculous to like a punitively and cruelly strike out like individual I don't see the art world doing too much actually I'm sure they will well so many oligarchs be yeah contributing contributing but the oligarchs I think have a very choppy relationship to Putin and to Russia they're not like I don't think like Abramovich is like a Putin pal no no because they they were all chased out yeah and kind of like I don't know like Berezovsky killed himself in bold quotes strangled himself kind of like Epstein style yeah yeah um Hedarkovsky is in London doing color revolution shit yeah that's another thing America and Russia have in common is well murdering the corrupt adversaries and making it look like I'm not even gonna go down this this route because it's it's like try it pointless but it's like such a double standard we murder journalists no we don't murder journalists not yet but we certainly do business with countries that murder oh absolutely and we murder political opposition but anyway I I do think that like the climate of Russophobia is probably gonna get worse do you think they're gonna put us in a internment cam in a gulag do you think they're gonna do you think red scare is at risk do you think we might get finally get D platformed that's a good question I'm sure we'll land on our feet also the thing we always do Russian hate unlike Asian hate is that it's kind of hard to tell who's Russian when you're just like walking down the street you know yeah it's not no it's true yeah we're not gonna be getting Jesse Smollett yeah though that would be a good move for me yeah yeah I have been getting post SAG awards there have been I have been getting like anonymous messages from people being like your days on the show are numbered cuz you're a pro-Putin sympathy really yeah yeah where on Instagram really on it's actually really embarrassing because a lot of my colleagues on the show are not widely maligned online the way that I am yeah when they like post pictures with me and stuff they'll get like comments from you know rabid succession fans being like get this Russian scum off your show yeah the showrunners hate Russia and I hate you and your days are numbered that's no it is really embarrassing I remember like having I forgot who I posted a picture I like storied a picture with somebody who was like kind of like a normal journalist and got a bunch of hate or like I've gotten when people post pics with me people comment like she's a fascist. I feel guilty pulling people into our retarded orbit. It makes you feel pathological. I know I'm like I swear I'm not toxic yeah it's just the culture yeah yeah it's just the Russophobic sentiment and like it looks bad it rubs off on you you know poor it like yeah yeah and then you have to like double down on being like a positive influence and a good person that doesn't feel right either like shit yeah when Simon asked to come on the show I was like okay it's not gonna be like the kind of PBS stuff you usually feedback you usually got I'm sure he knew it going in but Instagram is like a very positive and low stakes platform for me even though I am shadow band because people just like are overwhelmingly nice mm-hmm like you go girl congrats on your family but actually like last week I started getting like a lot of Russian hate and I was like okay I mean I think it's really funny yeah I'm not like it is funny it certainly doesn't hurt my feelings yeah but I do get a lot of like Russian Kant messages and I'm just like okay cool yeah I should start responding yeah that's a good use of your time trolling yeah but I I feel like I expect it'll probably get worse like in general not for us yeah like Russian tea room right didn't they have to like tack a sign to the wall they made a pre-emptive pro Ukraine yeah my question is how is this gonna affect the stock specialty gourmet shops in Brighton Beach because I like to run up in there and yeah we're gonna make a gold supply mm-hmm they stopped carrying Baltica at KGB bar because the owner is Ukrainian wait what Baltica the beer wait but what why cuz it is a Russian beer it's a Russian beer but they replace they replaced it with a Ukrainian beer oh I see that I'm look forward to trying after Lent is over because I am observing you explain Lent to me what's up with the Ash Wednesday yeah Ash Wednesday is the first day of Lent okay where in Catholics remember that they are dust and the dust they will return and then you undergo a period of 40 44 days until Easter I think it's 44 days this year of you make a Lent in sacrifice mm-hmm a lot of people give up chocolate that's what the movie Chocolat is about mm-hmm it's about a chocolate here opens a chocolate shop during Lent but I am giving up alcohol okay and eating Taco Bell well because I do be doing that too much and it's not it's not a sin to eat Taco Bell but it's not good for me and it's yeah you just sort of meant to yeah it's a period of pettenance for one sins and abstinence from things you would enjoy yeah well I I love it when myself sacrifice links up with my self-interest and like ooh I can't drink alcohol and I'm I can't eat yeah I'm fasting and I'm close and I'm closer to God than ever yeah totally okay cool so you it's it's sort of like Ramadan for Christians yeah you got to give stuff up yeah yeah yeah okay good to know exactly I like that every religion has like a month or something do you think like giving up I mean giving up alcohol is definitely gonna have some effects you think giving up Taco Bell first of all how often do you eat Taco Bell three two to three days a week okay that's a lot but all in that is also connected to my drinking I see cuz I'll be drunk and we eat Taco Bell so they'll they'll they'll happen in tandem and I God will give me the strength to abstain from these earthly pleasures that I love so much yeah Taco Bell not on the list of who owns Taco Bell not Mexican no no clue no clue not russians not russians yeah so should we talk about the BuzzFeed yeah yeah why not I guess BuzzFeed Joe Bernstein over at BuzzFeed news published an expose on the NPCC mm-hmm which stands for the New People's Cinema Club mm-hmm I guess mm-hmm but obviously is also kind of a clever little mpc like a non-playing character previously preemptively known as the anti-woke film festival yeah the director of which was this young man named Trevor Brazil who was meme Lord and former programmer I guess at the Borscht Film Festival in Miami I believe he was from Miami mm-hmm and he was the yeah the creative director of this I'm no I'm hesitant to call it a film festival honestly because it seemed like they did a lot of podcasts including us the one we did with John Waters yeah it was part of their it was part of their programming so does this mean we are getting paid by Peter Teal or we didn't get paid for that I don't know yeah that's right I forgot we did not we did not get paid to participate in the NPCC Fest mm-hmm partly because John Waters speaking fees are so exorbitant so he's getting paid by Peter Teal he's getting paid by Peter Teal how do you like that your favorite queer director yeah actually on the payroll of fascist paymaster Peter Teal but not us we're in the clear because we didn't really see a dime really from that no we didn't even we didn't even really get that many pages and we didn't me maybe sold some merch yeah I don't think very fruitfully yeah it wasn't our best it did have love John Waters he clearly did not know who we were that's okay which is fine but it did have a little bit of like a elder abuse hostage crisis vibe to me as someone who who was there he was a good sport he was a good sport he's a great he's a you know he has his talking points and we love to hear him mm-hmm so no no shade towards him so Trevor Brazil tragically died mm-hmm from a drug overdose like the day after the day after the festival the festival ended and the article sort of makes well you read it right yeah I felt like the the Russians advancing on a strategic location in Ukraine it was a real slog and route and I thought it was quite ugly to sort of use this young person who very tragically died as this like public city centerpiece for this article that didn't really make a ton of super salient points I mean there's no story the story is that this queer black kid died and is now the main character and he probably the the reporter probably had to like strain to give him kind of an outsized dramatized arc mm-hmm within this organization mm-hmm in which he was by no means the sole organizer right by linking him to Teal who probably did not even know who he was or what this festival I'll read the paragraph this is like this was like a particularly I also you know in full disclosure I mentioned a couple of episodes back right that a reporter had contacted me and I didn't about Peter Teal and I didn't say more but this is yeah who what like what this ended up as and at the time I was you know reluctant to talk to him not because I have anything to hide but a because I knew there was no story and be because I don't trust reporters nope but I'm so cocked I end up giving them mixed signals anyway like I don't I'm like some woman at a bar you know flirting with a guy like I can't just say no yeah you're like maybe I'll give you my number and we'll connect later yeah and I just like keep kicking that can down the road but here's the paragraph oh why Bazil wanted anything to do with Teal the billionaire venture capitalist pro-trump political donor and magnet for liberal fear and loathing was in one way very simple Bazil was the creative director of the New People Cinema Club a controversial film festival and Teal helped fund it why Teal wanted to anything to do with Bazil a queer black experimental filmmaker who supported himself by scooping ice cream is less obvious and it's like no offense but Peter Teal didn't know who Trevor Bazil was he probably was fairly unaware about the specifics of this film festival and like this is you know I said this to the reporter I was like listen I don't know anything about Peter Teal or his investment strategy but it's very clear that it's like a volume game for him as I said before he just like flings darts at a board and then something sticks right like there's no and Hadrian beloved who appointed Trevor as the creative director of the film festival was the one who obtained the funding through his association with Curtis Yerubin yeah precise this is all kind of out in the open and documented I immediately had a really bad vibe from from this endeavor and I knew something really bad was gonna happen yeah and I'm really sad about what happened to Trevor me too and I we yeah we were not up in that loft I'll say that much I'll say that much that was off the party the party loft oh no that all you know I'm too old and spiritually obese to go to cool it was debauched I'm sure it was debauched it was satanic on par with Astro worlds to me and it seemed yet to be to be driven by Hadrian's desire to sort of redeem himself as because he used to be a programmer it's in a family until he was I believe unjustly canceled yes he has you know been on this redemption arc that to me became a parent as being a way of salvaging his ego yeah and I think Trevor was instrumentalized by this festival by this sort of cultural venture that was you know not really in service of transgressive art or some kind of based vibe shift but just pure egoic pursuits well I mean and that he was a casualty of that I don't know I mean how much can we say like I'm struggling with whether I'd rather be honest or polite you should be honest but the fact of the matter is that like this festival which is barely a film festival it's a film festival only a name it's basically like a podcasting and content creation festival was the victim not of the political climate not of any kind of like censorship campaign it was the victim of its own poor planning and organization that's the story yeah and like I think it's forgivable and maybe understandable but there's nothing I mean to make it a question of like transgressive art in the post-trump age is just like patently false and I think again people now are like more paranoid and conspiratorial than ever and they try to establish these like Ukraine warm-up linkages between various kind of right-wing figures on the internet and it's like well Hadrian and Curtis and Peter Thiel are buddies yeah you know it's not that deep yeah in the article Hadrian is quoted as saying art is more interesting than politics and it's impossible to create good art when you're always looking over your shoulder you need a certain freedom from concern to create scared artists never win and that's why everything sucks now everyone's scared so he's basically making this old argument that art and politics should be separate but he's the one that made it political yeah by yeah he kept invoking cancel culture and yeah creative censorship or whatever and there was almost an undercurrent where like you could feel like they wanted to be cancelled they were like relished in much like Ariel Pink was yeah and then he went on his like boo-hoo I'm cancelled campaign afterwards when he literally was asking for it to use that terminology very deliberately and Bernstein also makes this point that they kind of unfairly earned the moniker anti-woke film film festival that was like you know that's just simply not true that they were ordered it that they were going to call it yeah they were going to call it that and when they approached us to get us to sign of a very informal loose loose contract sort of binding us to doing the John Waters show that said anti-woke film festival on it I said no way am I going to send this to my representatives and my distributors because I will not I do not want to be affiliated with something called the anti-woke film festival which is when they rebranded it as the NPCC and I think a lot of that branding was irony poison cynical misguided did not endear people to it besides the most kind of debauched hedonistic people who were using it as an excuse to do a bunch of drugs in some sinister loft and feel that they were partaking in something transgressive yeah and I think the way that if you want to put on a transgressive event the way you do it is with utmost discretion you don't blow up your spot in advance that was that was a big mistake yeah that's that's and I mean can you blame people for you know not wanting to associate with something like that it's not because they were cowards who feared being canceled or kind of social professional reprisal it's because people you know are not retarded and they caught wind of the fact that it was like destined to I don't know I don't want to be mean I don't know if it failed it like I don't think it felt like you know we success for what it was yeah but I think like it was imperfect and like you know I hope that there is a better more well organized iteration that isn't is less political right because there are problems you know because I do believe in like the underlying message of it that's not you know the one that's outside of the doing copious amounts of drugs in a doomed satanic loft yes yes I agree with that but there's there really is this it's like but the methods were reactionary and that was where it failed yeah and it's it's like it's like fawn antifa like there this is my issue with like the so-called post left they it's like yeah it's like fawn antifa they need the cancelers to exist they need them for their momentum they're also locked into like a yin and yang style like combat zone right and that to me is just like unspeakably gay and if there was something really knew it would transcend that whole paradigm mm-hmm which frankly this did this did fail fail to here's another quote from Bernstein in the days leading up to the NPCC festival Bazeel had confided in gay penny that he feared there was no organic reason for it to exist beyond tails money and beloveds ego so when gay penny saw Bazeel on the last day of the festival he congratulated him he had pulled off something on his own terms but Bazeel scoffed I don't think I have the capacity to do this anymore he said cryptically about the festival I need you to rip it to shreds and then it goes into yeah Bazeel's horrible death yeah what a tragic and depressing capstone like that was also like a moment of vibe shift mm-hmm but like a very bleak one mm-hmm my favorite part like on a lighter note my favorite part of the art article was when he calls Carl Bezier a journalist lol that guy needs help yeah I listen my my theory is that he's Red Scare's number one fan mm-hmm he does he do be listening do you be listening mm-hmm just stop dude he loves he loves pressing play the minute man just go to therapy conjuring up like paranoid webs of associations and freaking out about the political connotations of a podcast name is not journalism that's mental illness mental illness love so I'm sorry yeah yeah I don't know it's I personally don't understand why this article needed to be written yeah someone had to do it someone had to do it yeah someone had to make those tenuous connections mm-hmm and you know like I'm very sympathetic toward Joe Bernstein even though I generally loathe journalists and reporters with the exception of Michael Tracy because like yeah he has he's like you know a nice Jewish boy with a beautiful Armenian wife they have a baby who looks like he could be Lenny's cousin they have another one on the way like beautiful family God bless them we're powered to them but like I should have you know been honest about it and put my foot down and I'll try to be less of a cock in the future but I resented almost the line of questioning mm-hmm he didn't reach out to me yeah I know wonder why mm-hmm yeah whatever well I think that he probably thought that he would get more mileage out of me because of the kid thing yeah yeah more more of it in okay how long have we been going almost an hour 20 oh whoa okay any last any parting words about RIP Trevor yeah that's really all I have all yeah all I really have to say pray for it's too bad it's peace in the Middle East has that approximate rhyme and pray for praying has pray for peace in Ukraine yeah just and congratulations on your sag word also you looked beautiful and like a real movie star and Eli and I really so proud of you thank you and I wasn't on coke I don't do coke I just don't know why you would be on coke in that type of setting like it seems like I'm just a flinch I'm just a flinchy like nervous person I just I wouldn't want to be on any kind of like a mind or body altering drugs because you could really embarrass yourself yeah I was really or wet yourself trying my hardest not to do so it would have been great to have my Jennifer Lawrence moment wait what it does she did she trip to the Oscars and I did trip actually but backstage and immediately said my Jennifer Lawrence moment but I was yeah I was not under the influence of stimulants or drugs of any kind I was just a girl that was very excited to get an award sorry from fag hag to sag hag hey did you meet any celebs yeah yeah well you meet you met Kirsten Dunst I met Paul Reiser cover handed you he did which whatever I get it in this climate but I was really excited to meet him because I said I love Matt about you I said I only date Jewish guys because I grew up watching Matt about you and I thought that a blonde woman and a Jewish man was what a relationship should be the most natural coupling and I think you're so great and I don't think the Kominsky methods gonna take any any actors home that's what they call the trophy the actor they say the actor goes to which is a little confusing but cute yeah where's your where's your trophy it's in my room I put it like on them where I keep all my plans I I sat next to Patrick Wilson who is married to a Polish actress who we should have on the pot actually she's an actress on succession named Doug Mara and she's married to Patrick Wilson who is seated next to me and Maddie at the at the thing I think maybe there were some other celebs I encountered but I can't recall it was all such a blur because I was on so many drugs anyway see you anyway pray for Ukraine pray for you we'll see you in hell",

    "transcript_text": " That's totally okay, okay, we're back very special guest today. Brontes Pernell, the author of 100 Boyfriends. Hi. Congrats on the release of your book. Yeah. What do you feel? When did this book come out? Like very recently? Well, like it came out in February, but I'm actually I finished that shit like a year and a half ago. And so I've just been like sitting in crazy anticipation for this fucking this elephant birth or whatever. How do you feel now? How's your postpartum? Um, it's I don't know, it's good. I'm glad I'm totally glad it's out there and stuff. And yeah, it's probably the most produced piece of art I've ever put out because it's like, you know, it's like FSG is like this major publisher. And quite honestly, I always thought that my graduation into that would be putting a record out on sub pop. That's what I was hoping for. But this is what God gave me. So I'm happy to get it. So yeah, you were in the band Gravy train. Oh, Lord, yes. When I was like 12. Yes, younger lovers. Yeah, I still do that. Yeah, I'm and I've actually known you since I was 17 years old when I first moved to the Bay area. And I have a very reading your book, which has a lot of like, it made me feel very nostalgic for the Bay area, which by the way, did you hear Mills College closed down? Man, there are some angry feminists. They were like, that's where I first ate. Pussy. Yeah, they went bankrupt, but that's why I wasn't at Mills yet, but I was in Oakland and I had my 18th birthday party, which was like a garage rock show. And I don't often talk about my garage rock past, but I was like, I don't know, I don't know. But I remember it vividly because I was sick. I was like really drunk or sick or had like food poisoning or something. And you put me in your bedroom very sweetly so that I could like lie down. And that was the first time I had ever seen like a dildo in real life. Wow. And I remember being like, wow, like California. I'm in the baggage room and he has this phallic symbol of oppression. Just. Anything can happen. You were like in the, no, you were in the younger lovers video keeps on falling down. Yes. I was in a younger lovers video. I got mugged that day. I was like leaving your house after that shoe. And I was really stoned and I was like walking. I guess you said you were in the house. I was like, I'm in the house. I was in the house. I was in the house after that shoe. And I was really stoned and I was like walking. I guess you still, you still live there. I'm more reveal your location. But yeah. No, no, read his phone number on, on Eric. Cause maybe he has some fans who want to come and sex murder him. Oh God. There's nothing left to suck anymore. They. like that place got taken over and like by some like, you know, real estate firm and the rooms there are like $1,500 and $1,600 and like $2,000 a room now. That's insane. Yeah. Well, that's how it is here too, in certain parts, like Castlebrade or whatever in Bushwick, where I think they're like an apartment there costs as much as my apartment, but you like it's a communal like adult dorm room kind of thing. Who the fuck taught them, you know what I'm saying, like people get all the right messaging about leftist kind of culture, but then the execution just goes so terribly wrong. You're supposed to live with lots of people for it to be cheaper or whatever, but yeah, like when we like when we were hanging out that room was like 400 bucks and like I'll just be like looking at thinking somebody is like paying, I don't know, like $2,000 for this room. I used to smoke crack in and shit. Stupid. Yeah, I bet there's not a lot of muggies there. Wait, was this the mugging that you talked about on one of the recent episodes where the guy pulled the gun on you and you like laid down in a fetal position? Yeah. It wasn't a, it was like they were teeth. Yeah, they were like very young. So they seemed like they would shoot me. Yeah. Wait, hold up, wait, why the fetal position? Because I had never had a gun pointed at me before. I didn't mean to take the blame. No, it's that those are my instincts. I wasn't cut out for getting mugged. Yeah, I'm trying to think. I was like, I would, I've laid down before, but I never thought to go into the fetal position, which honestly sounds way more comforting. Like, yeah, I was just, my instincts just kicked in. I mean, it makes sense because it's like the position that you come into this world in and also, you know, could be the position that you were taken out of this world. Yeah, I hope to die in a fetal position. Damn. Well, I'm glad you're here. That video was really cute. It really, I'm glad I, I'm glad I had all those experiences. Well, no, I mean, it's, I don't know, it's, it's always nice to look at any type of timestamp. And I feel like that was like kind of like that last era where you could just call up everyone and they'd show up and like just shoot something on film and just, you know, like, because we're like, you know, crazy kids from the sixties playing. That was, no, that was really fun. And I think, yeah, right, not too long after that, that kind of was all over. So yeah, how so many people are that I know that used to live in the Bay areas seem like they're like, completely doomed. Do you know what I mean? No, I mean, I think, I think art like art wise, the Bay is a place that I think at several key points in this history kind of, you know, overestimated its importance. And, you know, people come with a lot of bravado and a lot of super, super high expectations. But really, it's just like, it's a very like DIY art place. There's no real industry here. So the kids I knew there's so much talent here that, you know, when they really wanted to compete, they moved to New York, or they moved to LA, you know, you can't really stay here unless you have some really, I think some really, really, really like iron clad sense of what you want to do and you want to take a super long road to get there. That's totally fine for here. But, you know, beyond that, you know, you're really good for East, though. Yeah, it's you know, it's not, it was a very Peter Pan place, I think for so long. And so, well, you know, out of being that. How did you end up in the Bay Area? You're from Alabama, or is that okay? Okay, so two things. My grandmother's brother came here in the 60s, and he was like this blues musician. He, so he worked at Fantasy Records, like he worked with like Big Mama Thor, and then Creed is Clearwater Revival, and like, you know what I'm saying, just like kind of in that loop. He was also the band leader at Elias Mile High, like a blues club. So he had this crazy white hippie girlfriend, and they would come to Alabama for family reunions, and like, they looked totally like, like West Coast Bohemian people, and we had never seen that, but they, of course, I think knew I was gay, and also, yeah, grandkids, like, or out of his grand musician. But you're gay? Yeah. Exactly. You know, I was a fucking, a pole smoker. What do you call fucking? Yeah, but he was like, you know, they were like, you need to move to the Bay Area, like you, you would love it there, blah, blah, blah. And then my friends were in this band XBXRX, and I think I was 18. I was 18. No, I was 19. Anyway, they, someone, they were driving from Alabama to Oakland, and the person they were going with dropped out, and they were like, do you want to hop in the van? And I just hopped in the van. Like, I had never even been here, but I was like, fuck it. Yeah, yeah, that's beautiful. And you stayed and, you know, you've been there ever since. So I guess we should talk about the book. I know that they always say to never judge a book by its cover, but when I saw the cover, I was like pleasantly surprised because you know, like everything is like this kind of Casper mattress subway ad design now. And I thought that I thought like the cover was really beautiful and well done and that like voted well for the rest of the book. And the book is really good. I highly recommend it. And I hate everything. I haven't read like a novel or I guess it's more like a collection of short stories, but I haven't read like fiction in a very long time. Yeah, no, it's a really beautiful piece of writing. I'm not just saying that this is black and gay. I'm not. I know so many black gay artists that make absolute garbage, celebrate garbage. Um, but that's really not like a racial or sexual orientation issue. I think just 90% of all artists make garbage. Media doesn't discriminate. That's the best argument against racism. But yeah, so the book, can you talk about like, how would you describe the book? First of all, because it's not really like a novel, but it's not really a collection of short stories either. You know, but on the other hand, I felt like it really honored like the formal conventions of fiction writing in a way that a lot of like a DIY or like more independent art does not. No, it was, it was, it was kind of a long road, how it got to look, how it did. How do I explain it? It happened like in sections. Like, so originally, let's go way back. I did this book called Since I Layed My Birding Down. It was my second novel. And I got this award called the Whiting Award for fiction. And it's like kind of a big deal fiction award. Like Tony Morrison presented our awards in New York that year. Like, and so it puts you kind of on a map in this weird way. And so one of this, this editor from FSG hit me up and asked if I had had any texts. And so at the time I was working on 100 Boyfriends, which originally was supposed to just be like this long form prose poetry book. So that section in it called The Boyfriends, that's more poetry. That's the original bones for the book. I was originally supposed to deliver that to City Lights. Like I was talking to City Lights, it was supposed to be like, you know, that experimental beatnik kind of poetry book. But when I got over to FSG, they were kind of like, well, do you have like any like stories or anything? Because we know like that's like a good, that's where you kind of shine or whatever. And I actually had been working on some short stories. So then we became kind of like beginning to like layer it. Originally too, those poems, the original poems was, I have this dance company. And four years before I had did this performance piece in this gallery called Bombs Uber, California. And it was a text installation. So those original poems you see were all texts in the background of this like dance that I had made. And then I was done with the show and I was collecting all the parchment. And I was like, oh, actually, I like these poems. I need to massage them more. And so that's what became the initial initial 100 Boyfriends text. It's kind of really convoluted, I know, but well, I think it has like a very interesting approach to time that feels very, it has its own kind of logic that feels very satisfying. Yeah, I really did enjoy it very much. Yeah, it was like one of the first, like one of the few books I've read that like, I didn't want it to end. Usually I'm like, you know, speeding through these books. And I'm just like, please make it stop. And you have to finish it. Because you're like interviewing someone or you put your mind to it or whatever. I'm just going to read a couple of passages so you don't have to quote yourself. They're like really beautiful. My mother had explained to me that buildings need a human breath in them to keep them moist and held together. Abandoned buildings are like abandoned people. They die sooner. What wasn't to love about Janet Jackson? She had it all. She had banged. She drank water out of the bottle. This baffled mickey. And she was a dancer who lived in a warehouse. I love the part about the guy like doing cardio in a fear based manner. And the part about where you say like polite lies are is how men conquer. And I feel like you really kind of skillfully toggle between being vapid and being profound, which keeps the kind of reader on their feet. But how much of this is like, autobiographical? You don't have to answer that question. What I really want to know is the guy in the first story who made who had 80,000 in his checking account. Is that a real guy you encountered? That's really what I want to know. Okay. So let me normally ask skirt that question. But since like we all sisters here, I'll give you the T like I'll give you the T. I'd normally write from an auto fictional space. Like, of course, it's like based in like something, but it's very rare that I'll just sit in a situation and just be clocking everything to like right later. The characters and the people are always a composite, like of probably like me and my friends. And like kind of like some other elements, like, it's pretty close to life, but it certainly did not happen that way. And also is the guy with $80,000 real? Oh, yeah, he's okay. Do you know how many fucking worthless waste of white privileges I have let coming me money lying around and I'm sitting up in this dirty ass room on a fucking bed with no blanket on it. And the whole time that fool was rich. But like, okay, do you know what he did for a living that he had 80 pay in a checking account, not even in savings? And do you know what his savings look like? That's another thing that I want to know. Like, no, like that. But then also I feel like there's like a lot of people around here like that. Like, I've had found over the years, because I do think for a lot of years, it was very much about like playing into like the grunge Renaissance. And we're all like dirtbags. But then one day it struck me, I was like, wait, like, some of us are not actually as poor as we you know what I mean? Like, so I think that that's kind of a funny thing. But I think San Francisco is like that all day. Like, I like LA because in LA, at least the rich girls pretend to be rich girls. Like, the Bay is very about like, we are all egalitarian anarchists, whatever. And it's funny, you would definitely I think about that character a lot, because he just like exemplifies what I think like, the most extreme of what the Bay can be. Yeah, totally. And that which contributes to the Peter Pan syndrome of a kind of it's like people go there to be degenerate. But more or less, and like, I'm not going to get it too much in on that tip. Because I mean, I know, obviously, I love the Bay, I love every place I'm at. But I mean, you know, I think so much of the soul of that book is based in this kind of emotional spear. So I don't know. I have a question about the epilogue of your diary. Is the record producer who you dressed up like Donna Summer for real first? Like, no, right? It's like, the other thing too is like, the whole point of this book was really to play with kind of temporality, you know, like, time. And also like 100 Boyfriends is like, I don't know, I have so many people that for real get mad because it's not like a book about 100 boys. But it's also like, I don't know. It's also how the character or the main character, though there's not one kind of shifts in moment in time or whatever. It's like, he's also one of the 100, you know, how we become a different person every time we date someone. Every time we leave someone, we become a different person, you know. So I don't know. I don't know how obvious it is, but it's a very temporal moment, most of it. You know, like in those video games where you use a joystick just to shift perspective, kind of, yeah, I'm like, that's kind of like in those fighting games where like, you can like, look at yourself head on, or you can see the motion from the back or the side, like how the camera is switching like that. That was one of the things I definitely wanted to play with. Like we're always the idea that we're always kind of a different person. Yeah, I mean, it feels it feels like actually going through it when you read the book, like you're experiencing it. Are you an alcoholic? I was for a lot of years. I'm asking, it takes one to know, and I'm asking just so much of the book is like, alcohol fueled, you know? Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's kind of very compote-y, right? Yeah. Well, everything is a composite when you're drunk. Oh, for sure. But it's also, I don't know, like there's so many, I think there's so many books and so many like kind of what I think is gay fiction in general. It's always like said to like prove us and are just like our best like kind of light or whatever. And they never, I don't know, it's always about like, oh, I found my daddy on the French Riviera and life is great and shit like that. They never really had just, you know, kind of like these base characters that I saw all the time, kind of like dealing like with shit. And I don't know, the homosexual world and the general artist world I came out with, most people like struggle with some form of addiction. And it's also so common that it not need to be like this, like, you know, the basis of the story, but it definitely is, you know, like a plot point in it. So I never really had a way from talking about that too, because it's common. Well, sorry. I, to that point, I wanted to ask you about sex addiction and quote apart. About what? Sex addiction. Oh, sex addiction. They say it's not an actual thing. So I've heard, yeah, but it definitely can feel very real. And it does in your book. And there's a part in one of the stories where a character goes to an STD clinic and he says, I get fucked a lot, doc. I said like so much, figuratively speaking, I don't have a mother a last name or a goal or a purpose in life. I'm just a whole. I stopped just short of saying my only desire is to be desired. I feel like the whole equation cancels itself out. And what really, what it really means is I have no will. I can it will work out all sense of self just so a boy can have one more hole to fuck me in. I'm afraid of this terrible power and we all I just wait to be wanted. It's killing me, doctor. And I thought that was a very astute and powerful description of a very specific kind of feeling that corresponds to being penetrated. And in that way, it's yeah, it is a very gay book, but it's also so is transcendent and speaks like a universal experience of being a bottom of bottom in life. No, for sure. You know, most of the people that really connect with this book are like women, or that's who I'd never, ever have a big group of gay men be like, yeah, Brontes, like it's always like, it's generally like punk punk punk ladies in my kind of same social sphere. Generally, it's generally like a 30 to 40 something like countercultural identified like ladies like, oh, I really like got this book. But then 100 boyfriends like how hard is it to fucking, how hard is it to like, get a woman to believe that man ain't shit. Do you know what I mean? So of course, of course, that's who's going to pick up this book and be like, no, I get it. Because it's probably like too close to home for gay guys, like, I think maybe gay guys would be more like, like they would gravitate to maybe a similar book written by a woman, but with lemon, like it's totally relatable for us, you know, because it's like, I think like, I guess my question would be like, do you think like everyone now is kind of a little bit spiritually gay? You know, there's so many like options, there's so many options now to where I think people can like really actually begin to even think or purse this out. What I do love about most of like, what's going on with like transgender rights and explaining that is really just the idea that sex and gender are two different things. And these were concepts that we were taught, you know, by people who I don't know, probably shouldn't have been teaching anybody a goddamn thing. So it's just something again to deeply question, you know, I forgot why I was talking about that. We're talking about how like your book appeals to women in their 30s and 40s, but I was thinking about how like women, you know, there's so many women now who are in their 30s and 40s were basically like single and like kind of alcoholics, like there's I read some article about how like liver disease is up among women. And I think we're all kind of like like reaching a similar thing. But on that note, there's also a lot of father son stuff, a lot of Freudian father son stuff going on this book, like one of my favorite juxtapositions, I'm sorry to use that word, I really hate it. Hey, counterpose. Counterpose is the one between the the like is the the one between the second story hoker voice part one, which part of which describes like the narrator's trist with a divorce handsome older black man with black man who has sons about his age, that he runs into one day with his sons. And then the third story inherited winter coat, which is which begins with an anecdote about the narrator's father, who was a train conductor and he accidentally helps the young man suicide on the tracks. And then he is, you know, has just died himself. I'm curious if that like particular, what was it counterpose? Is that was that intentional? And like how much of the kind of father son stuff was intentional? The daddy stuff. The daddy stuff. Yeah. I think I don't think it was like any more intentional than any, than any other than any other thing that was kind of set in the pantheon of things that we're talking about. And also like, I don't know if you could have 100 boyfriends or whatever, and you not discuss like essentially like the first man you ever loved or didn't love, you know, like this is kind of a homework in our lives. And I never even thought about it. But I remember when I was like 24, I was getting a job at this bathhouse in Berkeley. And the manager was just like this older dude, such a pervert. He was just like telling me how he liked the way my jeans fit. And then if I had problems with my father, like right in the And then I remember I was like, I did this crazy indie rock porn one time, like for this company, and I was auditioning. And like the producers totally asked me a question about like my father, like my favorite memory of my father, and then asked me to jerk off in front of them right after too. Like, so it was like, like, it was I remember like all these kind of crazy like pairings or how like I think in gay world, people really do like want to know like kind of this history. So yeah, I don't think it's like it was intentional so much is just really natural to kind of assess these characters are kind of in sussing out, you know, all their relationalities to men, you know, that question's going to pop up here and there, just naturally. The daddy is a very charged and powerful concept. It is a trope and a half. And there's yeah, there's a later chapter where the protagonist finds like an SD card with pictures of his dad getting like sucked off on it and jacks off to it for a period of time. Very cool. I said, I mean, I meant degeneracy and kind of a value neutral way. What did you make of the kind of like burger records, garage rock, pedophilia reckoning? You know, I think, oh, I have a lot of neutral feelings on it because I just feel like there were some white folks problems that I just need not concern myself with. Yeah. But I was really confused because it's it definitely seemed internal like drama that was happening like I don't know at the in the core of SoCal because they named all the list of the accused dudes. I know none of them motherfuckers. I remember one story where the girl was just like, yeah, I was 13 and I would call him over to my mom's house and we'd have sex outside in the car. And I was sitting there thinking like, I'm thinking like, girl, only a fucking 13 year old white woman or white past in Latina, whatever. She wasn't a nigga. I remember that. Fuck it. Fuck it. Gonna call, gonna call your fucking 28 year old boyfriend up to fucking the car and then fucking 20 years later be like, yeah, he was a fucking scumbag. And I'm just like, man, my mama would have whooped my ass. Like, could y'all fuck outside in the car? Oh, you're like, yeah. I mean, I didn't know anyone in like the burger record circle specifically because I was a teen in the Bay Area. So I was like, sort of the prey for like older Bay Area creeps and feeble files, whatever. But yeah, when all that stuff came out, I was like, well, duh, like, it's garage rock. And like these, it's not like they're like mastermindings and kind of like pedophile sex ring. I was like, these men are like mentally like teenagers. So of course they're going to try to talk like a teenage but hard core scene. Like any kind of like DIY music movement is chock full of like, young guys who want to fuck underage girls. It's just like far for the chorus. Yeah. And yeah, it's a very straight thing to make a big deal of mouth. Yeah. Well, it's well, because ultimately what was confusing to me was like when it was like presented, like it was like this like mastermind, like sex ring. And I just remember also just so much tumultuousness in fucking garage rock considering it's like the dumbest white boys playing a surf music. I don't know. You know, really, you have to have this type of scandal to get anything out of that because it was so rapid otherwise, right? And then I was just like, yo, like, they were telling stories about these dudes. And I'm just like, girl, like, even when I was 15 or 16, I could discern when I was fucking a homeless drug addict. Like, it's like, it seems like, you know, I mean, we all have that, right? We get older and we think about them first guys, we gave some pussy to and it was just like, oh, damn, like that guy was like kind of like a creep loser. How much how much you feel that person needs to pay for that or not really up to you and also depending like what like what happened. I only remember hearing a couple of stories where people like accusing people of like, like rape and like abuse and like gnarly shit. But then also padded with all these other stories of being like, oh, this person gave me out. Did y'all drop out again? Yeah. No, no, yeah, like it's kind of like these there was it just always confuses me when it's like the super disturbing stories of just like, you know, like rape abuse or whatever. But then flanked mostly and in the same regard as these stories are like, well, he was 21 and he gave me a beer at a show and like the hysteria around kind of, I don't know, there's kind of like, what seems like this kind of moral campaign, there's something about it ultimately that I think can read as disgenuous and it's like most extreme. So alongside, you know, shit that we should be concerned about to and like, you know, you know, taking a stand against like, um, I don't know, there's something about that that doesn't feel quite like it either. And also, no, I don't, I mean, it was definitely the most relevant thing to happen in the garage rock for a long time. But that reminds me of a part in your book again, where your character or the protagonist says a few times about being sort of like will fully non-judgmental. And he says one thing I can truly say I love about myself is that I'm too sketched to lead a moral campaign against anybody. Leading a moral campaigning against anything just seemed like a lot of work and I was stoned. No, I really enjoyed. Yeah, that was beautiful. I have a question about that because I read the kind of the New York Times profile. Congratulations on your book. And the guy said that the book's narrators share a set of tactics and traits. So however, a certain sweetness and passivity and above all a militant refusal to judge others. And, you know, twice in two separate stories, a narrator describes himself as willfully non-judgmental and then there's the passage that Dasha just read, which is when the narrator sees his HIV counselor and she refers him to a mental health counselor who then refers him to HR who then informs him that he should have the first counselor fired for triggering him. And then, you know, the narrator goes on to say like I'm not going to lead a moral campaign against anybody. But I want to ask you about this kind of like lack of judgment, which seems different from the lack of judgment that like I personally encounter in young people because that's like more like indiscriminate or casual. This seems more like a lack of judgment kind of inspired by, you know, it's like self-aware and world weary. And I'm curious if that's like a thing of age and experience, like you've been around the block. I'm not trying to date you, but or if it's something you've always had. I've been around the block and I don't know, like I think a lot of those stories kind of set themselves in kind of the spirit of dealing, being able to deal, like being able to deal communally. Because even saying, you know, even the title 100 boyfriends in a world where most people probably say they only have like three to four serious ones in a life kind of inspires the fact that you, you really are dealing with the subject of like humanness and how vast it is and how beautiful it is and how really ugly it is. And, you know, all of our, our problems or whatever, or if we look at like our problems or our degeneracies, you know, maybe not as like this kind of moral deficit, but something that kind of very well sits in a pattern of everything happening to us and like kind of the cascades of the world. Yeah, like how do you really actually, how do you really actually judge, judge, you know? I mean, of course there's levels of this. It's like, I really do believe that character when they said, you know, that this about this story with the drug addict where it's like his drug addict boyfriend shows up to be taken care of. He's just like, this dude could show up with a severed head and I would still have to take care of him. You know, there's also like themes of like, you know, kind of being a sub, being a bottom for the world and always having to absorb like the shock and like the general like kind of like pain of it all. So I think it speaks to a universal bottom experience that transcends gayness. Yeah. Well, actually like one of our first guests on the pod was like a gay guy who said, you know, like 95% of the world is bottoms, like regardless of, you know, race or sex or orientation or creed or whatever. And that's like very true. Like we're all kind of bottom for the day. There's no way to live in the world and not really be like, when are we not just, you know, I don't know, just enacted upon or extracted upon or, you know, and I think it's so funny too, when I see like all these memes of people being like, I should not have to do the emotional labor of X, Y and Z where I'm just like, I think emotional labor is kind of the price of the ticket of being born on this shitty rock. Like you don't, you don't get out of that, you know. Yeah, you don't get compensated for it. Not at all. In fact, I think it can even make it harder for you like exponentially, like just saying like I shouldn't, I'm above this or I shouldn't have to deal with this. It's just you, I don't know, you deal with it all, you know, and I don't know, makes you better or warps your orbit or both. But it's also, it's definitely like, I like it in that it's definitely a strong choice that this person has made, ultimately. Yeah, I mean, I guess what appealed to me about the book other than like the beautiful prose is that it was not at all like outraged or bitter. It's, I think there's even a passage. I can't remember it now where the narrator goes home after, you know, he's kicked out by this guy who's fucking because his boyfriend is coming home early due to an emergency. And he's like, you know, I don't feel depressed or upset or belittled. I just have like this sense of deja vu. And it's, I feel like that's what makes it kind of transcend most of the kind of cultural products that are coming out now because I like, you know, my thing is like gay culture and female culture has become both become really annoying because they're so outrage based, you know, they're so agree. Yeah. I definitely, I definitely get taken to tasks for that, like kind of a lot. And to go back before when I was saying like, Oh, like, I know lots of Black queer artists that make like garbage. There wasn't like a personal dig at them. But it's like, I have definitely been in spaces like that where there was this book since I laid my burden down where he talks about like just dealing with his white boyfriend. And like how his white boyfriend is just, I don't know, like, they kind of shitty. And I was accosted by this other writer who was just like, Well, you should have explained this and you should have explained that. And she should have. And I'm glad y'all finally articulated this for me. Because it was just like, I think in that character's head, he's just like, Well, yeah, I'm dating this white boy. Of course, he's kind of shitty. Do I really need to write an essay about it? It should be all in the plot line, like, and also just in dealing with lots of people too. Like, I don't know, I don't have, I think you, you phase out of outrage, you know, because really, like, you could be outraged from here into the rest of your life, how long are you really going to just sit with disappointment that, you know, often does not behave the way in which we want it to. You know, at the end of the day, like they say, you forgive people, not for them, but for yourself. You really, you really must. Like the one thing I've been dealing with too is like, all throughout this like, pandemic, I've just been finding new ways to blame my parents for everything. Because it's satisfying, like, shit, that's not even their fault. Like, I'm just like, I'm fat, you know, but it's, at the end of the day too, it's just like, I don't really have that, that thing, or I just, I feel like I've really come to the, with grips of the fact that there are really deep, irreconcilable injustices in the world, you know, and sometimes like a form of detachment is the only way to get around some of them. There's these spaces too that happen. I don't know. Just, just in looking of how we, how we have to correct the past for ourselves in order to move forward, you know, and I just, you know, things like healing, we say we throw out this word healing all the time. Yeah, early fucking process. It is really ugly nips and tucks that kind of have to happen. And, you know, I think this, in that book, we kind of demonstrate all the ways in which people kind of deal, but also presenting, presenting being willfully non-judgmental, but also presenting it not as a defeatist kind of thing, but actually something that takes a lot of fucking strength and kind of character to deal with, you know. Yeah, yeah, it's like, it felt like a kind of like zen like compassion that you know, I'm sorry, that's a very corny way of putting it, but it, but it's like something that you develop after like eating shit for a while and like, you know, coming to grips with yourself the rest of the world. And it just, you know, when you think, when you really think about like, woe culture, cancel culture, whatever we're calling it today, the main issue is that it's really taxing and toxic for yourself to be so constantly bitter and outraged all the time. No, for sure. Yeah, no, no, exactly. Like for sure. And it's like, if you go down that road of wanting to fund, there was some like person that said it, I've used this quote all the time, because one of my favorite mentors said it, one who devotes their life to cleanliness must also devote their life to dirt. And if, you know, finding hypocrisy or, I don't know, any of the isms in the world is your, is your bag, you will never ever, you will find a limitless supply of that all throughout the world, you know, so I don't know. We're very, we should discern how we spend our energy, but also I don't get on to younger people because I was a such a fucking, I was a know it all piece of shit, too. You know what I mean? We always want to like put all this shit on Gen Z, like, oh, they think so much like we didn't come on. Like, is it every generation supposed to be a shitty self centered brat? Like, yeah, I mean, it goes the other way, too. It's like, you know, when people, I flinched a little when like young people are go around calling older people boomers and being disrespectful to them, because I'm like, you're going to be that one day, don't you see that you're next in line like inevitably, but I get like, I get their position. Because they have no, you know, way of knowing. They have no discernment, too. And actually the boomers were really cool. It's just the really cool ones are dead. You know? Yeah. They were kind of a fucking, they're a badass generation with their fucking beatnik sweaters and shit. It was fun. Like, it was hella fun. But it's also like we, I don't know, I think, I think every generation or every age has a reckoning with the fact that you didn't really change the world. In fact, you added to the problem exponentially in a lot of jobs. So, you know, whenever you get to an age where you really kind of reconcile like, you know, I am actually taking up space. That's, I think, when enlightenment comes. And so, you know, we wait. And so, yeah, one of my favorite chapters in your stories in your book is about the white boy with dreadlocks. And he said, as I remember that every time he was on top of me, his threads would graze my face and it felt like a nest of spiders crawling over me. I was too young to understand how this would sustain me permanently. But then it goes on to, they take like a road trip together and then he's on acid when he realizes that he has to go back to college. And then it goes on at the bus station. I tried to convince the dreadlocked white dude to come back to school with me and that we should probably switch our majors to like business or computer science. I saw the look of judgment in his eyes and I knew immediately that he was going to say some busted shit and I was right. I can't follow you back to Babel when he explained. It's like Jerry said, man, short time to be here and a long time to be gone. And that one just made me laugh a lot. But I also thought that it had a very, a perspective of like wisdom and compassion throughout the whole book that was very nice. Yeah. And it's just like, I mean, he was a shitty white boy with dreadlocks, but at least he had good dick and paid for everything. You can hardly get that out of anybody. Like, so no, I really love, I kind of love all the cast of characters in there. And also, I don't know, I think it's, it's been a, it's, it's been a minute since we saw those people. Yeah. White guys with dreadlocks. Yeah. Well, I, I just watched a really bad documentary about Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers by Peter Bogdanovich. And I think his drummer is like a white guy with dreadlocks. He's in his like late fifties or something. And I was stunned that this man had gone, like, lived his life so long, nobody telling him that he needs to cut his hair. I just, it, it's, it's hard. But also like at this point, I don't even think I noticed people's hair anymore. Just ever since mine started turning gray, I don't really care about anyone else's. I like gray hair. I'm also turning gray. Can I ask you like about the, while we're talking about like age, generations and stuff, what are like the, the main generational differences you see between like Gen X and Millennial Gays and like Zoomer Gays? Because you're kind of a cast, yeah. Gen X, Millennial. I think the biggest kind of thing is prep. Like, and like the option of, of, yeah, just like the option of having prep. Like I do think if I had been just five years younger, I'd probably be HIV negative. And they would have just, you know, I was, I was just at like that cut offline. And so I remember like us being like just these wild hellish boys at the bar. And but also being very much like, I remember really idolizing that cult of Treasure Island media and like the barebacker dudes and stuff. Like, but that was like, it was a very quite a political statement then to be like, yeah, like, I don't, yeah, I don't fuck with condoms. Like, oh God. But also that kind of generational shame isn't really upon them. Because, you know, they have this drug that kind of erases the politicality of it. Because really, like if you, I remember like, if you said to some older dude, yeah, I don't want to use a condom, it could turn so quick, it either be like, oh, yeah, this boy is down, this boy is ready to party. Fuck yeah, or this fucking poor fucking kid, like who the fuck has been teaching him, he's been lied to, he has a moral deficit, just like kind of this really charged kind of ickiness that I think I explore in my other books more. But that's really, that's really kind of it. But then also being that I came of age really before Grindr, and I really was probably like, I was a bathhouse boy, like I went to a bathhouse. Whereas like, I feel like most millennials that I've meet, they really kind of grew up on Grindr with this super selective like thing where it was like, I was like at the bathhouse fucking older dudes and how that's kind of a generational thing too, because as I'm getting older, a lot of the men that were like my first sexual teachers, they're like dying out, or they have erectile dysfunction to the point where they don't really perform as tops anymore. So they move out of that realm, I'm filtering into the age they were, right, as I met them. But I don't see that kind of the way my age group had stormed that bathhouse kind of, I don't really see those numbers getting replenished. Okay, like I remember just a flush of like dudes my age, like at the bathhouse when I was like going there. Now that I'm filtering into the age that my daddies were, when I first started going, I don't see that kind of critical flush or the last couple of years, I don't really see that many young people like doing it because I think it's that thought of as like an old form. I will say after the pandemic is over, maybe that'll all change because people are sick of looking on their phone and they just need to like go in a fucking an actual place with people willing to do it and get it done. So yeah, I hope so. I hope so. My fear is that people are going to like retreat more into their phones and stop fucking completely. Yeah, because yeah, like, I think all stats point to the fact that like, people are just fucking and sucking way less than young people are. Like there was some chart that was circulating on Twitter about how like, a skyrocketing number of young men report being virgins much later, which was crazy to me. Well, those are straight. Yeah, yeah. They're probably not gay, but I'm sure there's a slight uptake among gay men too. I wouldn't be surprised. Yeah. Probably, you know what though, I never feel sorry for straight dudes in that regard, because it's just like in cell culture. It's just like, if you sit and fucking at a table and watch porn on the internet all day, of course, you're going to be terrified to approach an actual woman and any kind of, you know what I mean? Like, I think just like, I don't know, like, it's like, they're probably virgins because like, they probably just don't aren't very good conversationalists. Maybe they do kind of like, like suck. I don't know, like they should try being gay. Well, also, they might blow it the hell off exponentially. Like, yeah, they could learn about conversation skills and intimacy and they can definitely play. I think that those are the boys that go over and like end up just doing a bunch of speed as to they can, so they can have sex. Like, they still overgo the kind of finishing school you need to like kind of get laid, even the most basic of parameters, just like, I don't know. So there's a story in the book where an older protagonist is advised to take or he's looking like an ad or something for like testosterone replenishing treatments or something and he sort of, I forget what it says exactly. I didn't write it down, but about how he actually likes the diminishing testosterone and the sort of psychic effect it's having on him. And I was interested, yeah, kind of in your perspective on testosterone and its effects. Well, what I had in my 20s was I had a lot of like trans men and I noticed that when they started taking like testosterone treatment, like they just like turned into like these like horny like teenage boys, like everything would get so hype. It was like very argumentative. It's just funny. It's some funny shit. And it's just like, it is crazy to think when you think of like, like I reside in a body, like I am very like, I am a hormone driven thing to a lot of aspects. Of course, like, I have reasoning and I have function, but it's just like, I don't know, there's like these basic things that kind of like, I don't know, you know, make it really fucking wild. And yeah, like I'm definitely, I'm definitely older. I'm definitely in that testosterone, replenish category, medically medical wise. But also the thing is like, you have to get you have to do it too, because it throws all your other chemicals out of whack. And it makes it you're more susceptible to things like, I don't know, heart disease, depression, like muscle gain, you know, but it is hard to like kind of like make make that choice, where it's just like, you know, depending on this thing, where it's just like, I don't, I don't know. I just every time I look upon my very like testosterone driven, like sexual 20s youth, I just there's so much chaos there. And if there's like a buffer between that, like, I don't know, it's great, you know, I do honestly see how some people like kind of like turn into like, these like celibate monks, sometimes just like, you know, you know, like there's something about really tasting peace, after you've tasted lots of chaos, where it's like, you know, there's plenty of us that would do anything to keep, you know, a sense of peace, you know, perspective shift. But I mean, like, I was having this conversation with my sister, the other day, because, you know, we had such a chaotic upbringing. And I think, you know, she said to me, all I want is peace. And I was like, Yeah, me too, like, I want to lead a boring life with peace, but you lose something, right? Like, in this story, you talk about how like, the narrator, like, he feels like he's no longer violent or horny. And there's like that connection between like violence and horniness, that it's also like, you know, the thing with, with like, gay guys is that it's two dudes, that's just what it is. So it's always going to be like more violent and more horny than like, or exponentially, like, no, I feel like most of the sex I have with other dudes is like, we're like, you know, like volleyball teenage girl players. Plus, like, but women are violent as hell. I remember this. They are. Especially when you're high tea. This like girl, when I was like, my first move to the punk house, this girl like came into my, this girl I lived with, she was like a, you know, she came into my room in this like, cowgirl dress with and like pulled it up and she had like on a strap on right. And this before I ever even got fucked, I was sitting there with this boy that I was kind of dating and she was just like, I'm going to give you a surprise today. And she like has some lube with her and just throws like pulls my pants down, throws it on my ass and like gets on me and just starts going for it. And I was like, remember, like, just being so like, like, I was like, okay, I guess I'm just like here with a hole. I don't even think I'd ever even got fucked yet. Like, whatever. Remember just being like so like, so like, like, damn, like, no, like, what's this idea that like girls aren't fucking crazy. Well, they are. Yeah, I also think like, that's the other thing that nobody talks about with like me too, where women are like perpetual victims and sayings and stuff is that a lot of women are very physically violent. It's just no man would really report that because it makes you look weak, you know, it's not it's, it's really interesting because I, you know, growing up this like in the 80s and like rural situations, like, where I think domestic violence is like so common, people like turn a blind eye to it. But then watching those situations where like kind of both people play into that dynamic, where like, I've seen situations where like this woman would like, you know, emotionally corner her husband for like three hours at a time, just like this relentless onslaught of just, you know, every horrible thing she knew about him is past just like cornering just like some violent shit. But the point of the point of where it crosses the line is when like, the dude would hit her be like, get the fuck off me, bitch. That's when the police get called. That's when, you know, that's when like, male by the, the, the punctuation on that is always male violence, right? Like, like a dude hit someone like that's like where that's where it like all stops. And that's like where it ends. The situation that happened before it, I don't know, it's talked about. And then often I would see sometimes like those self same women, once the guy is not there, kind of turn that abuse to the children. If you grow up witnessing all the ways in which this actually works. Yeah, I do think that you always kind of have this back IQ of like, just, I don't know, kind of wanting to see everything because it kind of works so goddamn counterintuitively and also the ways in which we all are enforcers of the patriarchy and kind of like patriarchal violence, you know, so. And straight men are very ill equipped, I think, to encounter emotional violence. Oh, they don't have the, the fact that they lash out the only way that they kind of can, which is ultimately very weak. I think about all the time, kind of like my grandfather's generation in general, and like how like, yeah, they're like the heads of these houses and they're just male like privilege, but then also that point where like masculinity becomes like so infantilizing, where like this man's whole life, all he was expected to do was go to work, lay his paycheck on the table, and then deal out ass beatings to the children as according to like what his wife said, you know, like his wife literally like became like his mommy in a fucking in a very real sense, and just kind of never, you know, and he did that at like 19, you know what I mean? Like, it's like, how are you ever supposed to like become a man where you moved from like your mother's care into your wife's care? And then, you know, what we talk about, like, I think toxic masculinity is just like really just kind of like this toxic immaturity, but also so much of our society, it gets built off of keeping men in that infant, infant state, you know what I'm saying, like not really having to like really know what it is to access your manhood or always constantly rearranging or changing what accessing manhood means. Of course, like we have a bunch of fucking confused people, like, but it's like so much, I don't know, that same system that, you know, kind of wants to keep women perpetual infants also does the same thing to men, you know, in this weird roundabout way. And so what you have is like a really fucked up mess. And just given what they've done to the idea of a nuclear family over the years, I don't, I'm not someone who looks or like, it's another thing I don't really like about a lot of the straight men I know, like they kind of sit there and they're just like act like fucking him bows, they're like, why is the system burning down? I don't understand any of it. I'm like, there's no one, no one's invested in you ever fucking asking anything about it or asking a question beyond like these simple privileges they've allotted you and you dare not questioning them when you question them, you actually could have a whole lot more. So I don't know. I could talk all day on this. Let me just in. I'm sorry, you guys, I didn't mean to get on a soap. No, no, no, no, no. No, by all means, because the internet is going to crap out this time. Yeah. So that's all on the record. Another motif of the book kind of to circle back, I think we've landed on something interesting with like the Zen quality that the book kind of has. And another motif of it is is boredom. It seems like the narrating protagonist is often bored or experiencing some kind of like deja vu or like repetitive cycles or something, but there's a part in one of the stories where someone describes being bored and says no one comes to punish or rescue me. And I thought that was very, that was like a Lana Del Rey song or something. Beautiful. And that's yeah, Lana is a real, a real bottom, I think. We're going to say a real poet, but she's a poet and a bottom. And a cancer, like me. And a cancer. Oh yeah, I was going to ask you this time. It's funny because she got in trouble, right? Because she was talking about how there's no room for fragile women and people made it into like a race thing and tried to say that like she was coming out against like black pop stars or just not the case. But I think she was just expressing her eternal state status as a bottom. She's like, no, it's so funny when they're just like, no, like, look in, you're talking shit about black women. But actually, if you put it into context, Lana Del Rey is a pretty delicate white girl. And that's okay. But then you also sit her next to like, make the stallion and Cardi B who are like, fucking on the stage in front of the Grammys. It's kind of like, I do kind of love the world we live in now. I like just, I never thought it possible. Sometimes I'm just like thinking out loud. I'm just like, yeah, all those things kind of coexist. But yeah. No, I try to get in touch with my fragile inner white woman, but I still feel like my fragile inner white woman will still cut you like she's a nasty bitch. She's not gonna curl up in the fetal position. I mean, she might, you know, but she fucking does it, man. I don't know. You're still in for a fight. Okay, so when I think of boredom, I do think it's kind of just a general thing of like, you know, some ADHD shit where it's just like, it's more so just like, yeah, the need of feeling like you should be constantly like stimulated or something should be having more like, like flow. Like, I guess that's a question too. It's just like, why is this person particularly bored at this moment? Well, that's because they find stimulation and being in peril. Like if no one's coming to rescue or punish them, then there isn't any sense of like, peril or urgency. And that that's like a driving force of the young protagonists kind of life. Yeah, totally. It is funny too. Because then when the older characters, you see them yearn more for that piece. Yeah. So it's like, exactly. I do think these things kind of balance themselves out. And yeah, it's, you know, for as much people talk about like, I don't know the book being slutty or whatever, like transgressive. It's like, I think the book kind of just deals with the fact that like, we are not fun sluts. Like sex happens in a lot of different facets, like sex happens because of boredom. It happens because of, I don't know, you know, like, like trauma, like, or just, you know, wanting to like, we have a pattern reoccur for comfort or something like that. So it's another great story is when he goes to fuck the Satanist guy. He wants to fuck a Satanist. He realizes how like mundane and corny it is. Yeah. Oh, man. No, it's, I think we've all had to fuck that level of dungeon and dragons do just to see if it was worth it. And sometimes it is. Sometimes it isn't. I mean, the condom thing was really funny for me, because like, if you're a Satanist, why would you abide by kind of the laws and standards of the normal, like, yeah, sexual health or like Christian ethics, right? Aren't you supposed to be bucking that trend? I think that was like really funny that he has like a bowl of condoms or whatever when he should be. Yeah. But it goes to show like how kind of like symbolic aesthetic these identities are. No, yeah. And just, you know, people's personal boundaries are limitless. You know, like, like, it's just kind of like, yeah, even like the other day where I was just like, there was this homeless man trying to sell me a butane-less lighter. And I was just like, I was like, oh, like, I can't shake his hand. But if it had been 130 in the morning in the park, I totally would have sucked his dick. No, it's like, bro, like, what are these? I was trying to parse out what boundaries really mean. Well, it's, it's, it's always funny when somebody slaps you with like an arbitrary boundary that like they shouldn't have. Like one of the funniest things about dating Jewish men is that they're all hypochondriacs and obsessed with their own mentality. But they'll like eat your ass and fuck you without a condom, like no questions asked, like any woman. And I don't get that. I'm like, how are you like getting your blood pressure, you have like a blood pressure machine in a food scale and you're like counting calories and like, but you'll do that. That's your, it's really funny. Like, I mean, I think personal boundaries are like very kind of like random and arbitrary. The scary thing is, I'm not like, where the fuck is my Jewish boyfriend having to work hard enough? Like, damn, like, I think, yeah, now that you you're getting all this great book praise, I think he's right around the corner. Yeah, now that you, you have a glowing profile in the New York Times, which is like the Jewish Bible. But I think, I think your problem is you live in the wrong place. You need to move to New York. This is where they are. Let me intermittent, let me finish my intermittent fasting for a year. So I can like, you know, like just, you know, be skinny again, because yeah, I'm fucking shallow enough to say it. And then yeah, I'll come to New York where I plan on gaining more weight. Cause there's just, I assume if I moved to New York, I'll just like, you know, be like thick, curvy in charge. But I want to start at a lower base before I amp up exponentially. Totally. Yeah, that's okay. This is, this is a pro weight loss podcast. In case you haven't noticed. Oh my God. It's so hard down too. Cause I'm at that age where I'm just like, I feel like, you know, I do think I'm all for everybody feeling like good and like totally like addressing like any type of complex that like fucks with us. But I've always had a weird things with my fucking food and diet. Sometimes I think body positivity can also be a form of self deception. I feel like I don't like everything about my character. Why should I not be able to not like everything about my body? I need not essentialize what I don't like about my body. But I also like, I don't know. I want to be able to like have critiques or whatever. But then even now when I want to go to lose weight, I can't even get to the treadmill cause I'm like, am I losing weight? Cause I want to lose weight. I'm losing weight because of internalized fat phobia. Am I doing this right? Am I a poser? Like it's like there are so many voices around it now, which I guess you'd have always been there before, but sometimes I just, that, that, that, that moment of inaction cause there's just too many goddamn points of view. Sometimes it gets, it gets kind of heavy on me. Do you like that guy? Yeah, I like you know, it's funny too. Cause it's not, it's not a problem on other bodies. That's why I asked cause it's like, yeah, I think you look hot. I think you're great. Yeah, you're good. I like the salt and pepper personally. Fuckin, I earned it, goddamn it. It took long enough. But it's, no, it's, plus like even now too, like it's, when you get older too, you realize how much time you spent hating yourself at your skinniest. Yeah, most beautiful and you're never going to get that back. When they say youth is wasted on the young, like that has to be exactly what they mean. But then also like I'm thinking now too, where I'm just like, I've had this body so long and it's looked so many different ways. I actually can never truly hate it the way I did before either. So even with that or being like, I want to lose weight, there's just such an appreciation. There's appreciation for the process. Cause when you get to the age where you've seen your friends like go crazy, get cancer, die this, when you get to the bottom of how your body can truly fucking betray you, like if you're still walking, like you really should love that shit. That's like some base level shit. But then also it's like, yeah, I still want to be 190 pounds just one more time before I die. So yeah, but I think like that, I guess that's what I was getting at this, like this lack of judgment and friends presence of like a zen like compassion is basically also like a sense of gratitude, which people don't have now. I think that's all it is. Did you fucking like, no, like it's like, we are fucked, but you are with child. Like it's like, it's crazy. She's got a baby inside her. I always, you know what I always think about, which is crazy is that I have a male baby inside of me. So I'm like carrying something with like testosterone and a penis inside of my female body, which is just like very trippy. It's like psychedelic. He's gonna suck on your chin. I never even thought about that. Really. I have like a whole other trip with my mom, because it's just it's so different to when you're like, with like a single mom. And like, you're like, you're like the son, you're essentially the man of the house, but it's like, you're so like, you're the property of your mom. Right. Are you an only child or? No, I have like a younger sister that's like four years younger. But for a minute, it was just like, you know, we had different dads, and my dad was kind of not in the picture. So even within the house I grew up with, with a stepfather, I was still just very much under the dominion of my mother. It was weird, unspoken, like rule, you know, and it's, yeah, I think it's like, it's, it's, it's funny, or I do, I am one of those dudes who claim like that is like kind of like my root and feminism, which like a lot of people like make fun of when guys are just like, oh, like my root and feminism is like watching my mom or being around my mom and people are like, oh, that's a very original answer. But part of me too is like, it's always some white feminists who grew up with like their mom and their dad. Your household is just like, no, like you actually grow up with a fucking mom where like she is the breadwinner and she fucking deals with everything and you see what she fucking deals with in the world without a man there and you understand quite quickly, you know, how fucked up the world is, like, you know, for poor people, for women, for all of that, you know, but this is also, this is essentially like what the basis for what we call like third wave feminism, which I think I hate how that term often gets just one third wave. Yeah. Okay, so the second wave feminism, like, you know, like, like white women burning bras, blah, blah, blah. Third wave feminism gets attributed a lot, I think to riot girl and just, just like general like, just like, I don't know, like, Gen X white girl shit is why they always sum it up. What I didn't know is the term third wave feminism was coined by Alice Walker's daughter, a black woman came up with the term and the essential point of what the biggest distinction with third wave feminism is intersectionality. That's what they never kind of that's the I learned about that at at Mills College. Oh, no, I really did. I remember being like, Oh, wow, intersectionality, they taught you, like, they actually taught you about feminism. And yeah, I got a real feminist education. I learned about all heterosexual sexes, rape, where I fall on the intersectionality on the kinsie scale. Yeah, nobody taught me this. Well, I was like, I was, I was lucky because like, when I was a teenager, like, I was getting like, letters from Kathleen Hannah, like, kind of breaking it down. And you toured with litigra, right? Yeah, I was looking at the gravy train Wikipedia, because I liked gravy train, honestly, in high school, because I was into like, litigra and like, electro music. Remember that? Have you heard Aisha erotica? No, I'll send it to you. But it's like, she's like newer. But she totally reminds me of like that whole electro moment. And I was just like, Is that making a comeback? Like, I would hope not like, because it's just there's something so very like, you can't repeat like post 9 11 antics. Yeah, we won't recapture that feeling. Like, but there's something about that was just really funny. Tigra is the one that like JD Samson was in. Yeah, okay. But JD in now crickets, JD's in crickets now with Roddy from faith no more. Oh, yeah, I remember seeing JD Samson at like Union pool or something. And also seeing the blues blues guy at Union pool. And I was like, Okay, well, this is over. Like that was my first brush of celebrity. And I was like, this is like so depressing in Monday. And that's what life is all about. And the cult of celebrity got even more depressing in Monday. It's like, everybody, it's all like, you know, like when it went from when Jerry Springer went from like a slew of stuff to just kind of like, I don't know, all like, what's the word? maternity test, like when it used to be like all about just like, you know, what's movies are in or what stars and but now the entertainment has become so overly democratized and just like this sandwich board option, like, all we see now is sex scandal. Like, you essentially can't be famous without a sex scandal. Yeah, yeah, the same story that repeats into infinity now. And so yeah, you have to hire like a PR team to manufacture a sex scandal for you so you can get famous. Yeah, I don't know. It's really like degraded and retarded. I mean, as well that fucking should be it was we had a good run with it. Why should we be entertained ever again? I'm optimistic. I think post pandemic people will want like to have meaningful experiences. I think I think the fatigue will like will break break on through to the other side. Yeah, if we get tired and bored enough. I don't miss anyone yet. Like I just think I don't know the last couple of years in the Bay, I think especially after like ghost ship happens, and then just slew of shit and bad shit. And it like it just it was just a really depressing and kind of bummerish place. And even as we come out of lockdown, I'm part of me too is like, I think this scene needs another year of lockdown so we can truly miss each other. We can't come back to each other with like open arms. So what are your hopes for for the rest of the year? I guess. Well, I'm like, I'm kind of overwriting about gay slut shit. So I'm doing this new novel. That's it's a sci fi novel. It's about a family of psychics of black psychics in the rural south who are all that were with each other and it's called The Body Writes a Book. It's going to be my first sci fi book. Cool. Yeah, and then I just I put out a I just put out an EP called White Boy Music. Billy Joe Armstrong from Green Day just reviewed it in Rolling Stone. I read that. Cool. I did 12 rolls. So we're probably gonna do some more recordings. I'm turning since I laid my burn down into a movie or I'm turning it into a movie and people are trying to acquire the rights to 100 Boyfriends to make it a TV show. So that's awesome. Try my best and also still living with five people in communal punk land of Oakland for the rest of my life. Well, thank you for coming on the show. I love y'all so much. I'm really proud of you. Oh my god. Thank you. You're like you've been working girl. I'm proud of you too. We've come a long way. Also like like congrats like with the baby. Hopefully I'm going to join the parent club one day. I'm still trying but oh I had one last question. Have you ever had sex with a girl like normally not pegging you? No, no, no, like this I had sex with a trans dude who actually referred to it as his pussy and it was like two like two or three years ago and it was like really hot because he was younger and it was the first time anyone was ever really into like that whole like daddy role play thing and he was really into like me being like dad and I was just like oh my god like this is like blowing my goddamn mind. I'm just like I'm normally mostly like a bottom anyway so me topping is like just like and first of all it's like I just landed on Mars like what is going on and then this fucking added drama of like where I'm like the old dude and I'm just like oh wait like I am the old dude now so that's that's probably the closest I've ever like gotten just because like he is insistent on being like my pussy, my pussy, my pussy. So yeah. That's it, that's it. That was your bye-bye. Anyway everybody should read 100 Boyfriends. We will link it in the description. Thank you for coming on Brontes. I love y'all so much. I'll talk to you soon. Come to New York. Yeah, come to New York. Thanks for giving us hope. We'll see you now. Bye. Bye. I'll see you soon. Bye.",

you\"},{\"currTime\":4508,\"text\":\"well that's the mistake we keep making with with crumbs and I yeah I don't want to talk about him because\"},{\"currTime\":4514,\"text\":\"no no it's okay I can also like edit this out\"},{\"currTime\":4517,\"text\":\"no we've talked about him we've talked about him we've just bleep bleep his name out\"},{\"currTime\":4524,\"text\":\"the subsack but this

    "transcript_text": " oh yeah Nathan fielder oh yeah Nathan the mom life stuff monkey pox it's a loose docket but yeah there's some items this is a free one right yeah we should do a free one yeah cuz we on paywall the job yeah we're back oh are we recording yeah oh I was just gonna say how we really need to regain some of that goodwill by making this a free episode mm-hmm after the fallout from the Alex Jones thing oh we did it a while ago y'all I know I know but I can't I hate when people get mad at us about something I'm like you already did this one I know you can't come on I know I'm not opposed to like critique I just I'm tired of the same old critiques I want some new ones I'm out at work being so annoying so that you guys can find new stuff to be mad at me I don't even notice there they're still fixated on like shit we did four years ago I still think we're dirtbag left I know DSA betrayal I know one of the shocking things about palling around with right-wingers mm-hmm which is by the way a hundred percent verifiably true I'm not even gonna try to dispute that is that they're all like wow you and you and Dasha are so brave to to finally go mask off and turn your back on Bernie DSA left as um yeah and I just like I I always feel like a little wounded and like want to prove myself no no you don't you guys don't understand I've been more racist and more right-wing than all y'all since day one and then I you're the least right-wing you've ever been I know I know it sucks I'm you're basically a libtard I know I'm a libtard now I'm I'm debuting live time you a new orientation on the political axis which is called racist centrism it's like when you're like a Hillary or Pelosi centrist yeah but you're into race science I like it yeah I think that's actually it's just with the third way the fourth way how many it's like feminism there's been so many waves I've lost count yeah the 40th yeah the crimson wave centrism um people are yelling outside yeah I don't wanna they hootin and hollerin yeah it's tough it's hard out there I was just telling Dasha I know things have gotten really bad because they started closing like the cheap sick bodega on my corner at 10 p.m. not the boat bodegito no where and don't they will I get my cafe seat up your late-night cafe seat oh what were we talking about something oh yeah but my point is that every time I want to like annoyingly clarify these people I'm like no no just let them think that you're a reformed leftist because there's nothing right-wingers love more than like having like I said like that one black friend or that one leftist friend who like it's like they actually make some good point yeah mm-hmm they they feel like such kind of alienated misfit losers that they really love having people in their camp a normal for a normal I mean I was I guess I was a leftist but I'm just pretty impressionable you know well you're a whammin I'm a whammin you're an actress and yeah I see I'm a vessel exactly we wouldn't have it any other way yeah I'm just being honest I know you know and you're the message you're not impressionable in the ways that count thank you yeah but that's all that matters yeah I'm emotionally impressionable you have an immutable moral compass thank you thank I'm very tired I was just telling and I've been having a bunch of nightmares oh yeah keeping me up all night like weird like young Ian and time yeah like apocalyptic mm-hmm dreams psychic premonitions I mean I hope not not all my dreams have psychic contact but sometimes they definitely do but it's never useful it doesn't occur to me until like something happens down the line and I'm like oh I dreamt this it's like yeah it is like very there's no utility to retros retro active but when I see blood rushing down the streets all no my nightmares come true no yeah I'm very tired too I I'm bad we could know it's it's not even has anything to do with like motherhood or hormones or anything I just like woke up really tired yeah August is a rough it is yeah rough month to be in this in the city I know are you getting out of town anytime soon mm-hmm you guys are kind of good about doing the day trips yeah we'll do some more day trips yeah my birthday is coming up oh yeah I was thinking about what to do with that and like my inclination as you get older is to just do like a a quiet low-key dinner yeah but I was thinking of like maybe like inviting crumbs to my birthday so he could write like a 20,000 word that one's mad long yeah 200,000 his magnum opus and his birthday party and then she said no but give Steve Saylor a chance he's actually a very funny writer and vivid storyteller go and a good one episode without mentioning it's because we keep getting away with it that's why we're like we're like well no one said anything I guess we'll just bring him up again one of these days someone's gonna compile all those this is my way of like manifesting a meeting at clandestino of crumps and say no Steve X clandestino where does he live and so Cal I think nice good for him yeah yeah his manicured ass lawn he's got a mellow kind of so Cal by about chill so Cal done God we're both like really brained I know I'm pretty I'm pretty pumped about the stock yet yeah okay that's good I'm into I'm into like well the Brody thing is an interesting what's the Brody the Richard Brody thing he wrote about Nathan Fielder oh the yeah the New Yorker article yeah themy Lovato becoming a she she her I think she's still a they them but she's a she her too mm-hmm cuz she no one was probably calling her they them yeah it just kind of gets like confusing in articles yeah yeah who goes by she them she them is is crazy oh but well yeah speaking of n times I went to the um Adidas store to get these samba's are those new I got a new pair of sneakers mm-hmm those are really cute yeah I kind of I like the silhouette yeah let me hold on a second sneaker had Dasha yeah but the Adidas store was a total mess yeah in this way that made me feel like things were kind of falling apart and the area and then I went to Starbucks and there were the employees there were talking about how they haven't been paid and how they're gonna burn the Starbucks debt to the ground if they don't get paid it might have been a franchise issue yeah I don't think there's systemic failure at that level at Starbys but I was like whoa I was like yeah and everyone's kind of bad at their job like worse than ever yeah now that I need service people to be you know like catering to my every whim but like people are distinctly kind of like no we're not divas or bullies no most people including ourselves are like quite receding in real life and yeah I'm very much don't go your way you don't like throw a fit you just kind of like no oh yeah yeah take your time I went to the Balenciaga store today and I was like stunned but of course Balenciaga is you know exquisitely merchandised and exquisitely air-conditioned and which one and you were in Soho in Soho yes I went to try on one of those Kegel bags that I'm still holding on hoping they'll send me what what's a Kegel bag it's like the the hobo bag that they have with the little hand mirror it's so cute yeah and they keep sending me they sent me a new pair of like lesbian Tava style sandals which are like cute but I'm never gonna wear them it not because there's anything wrong with the sandal but I have a size eight foot well that's okay it's okay if you're small it's okay if you're five seven five nine it's not okay if you're five four and I can't wear any kind of chunky footwear that makes the foot look larger than it is well that I like the Samba because it yeah it really like a slim it's like a Beavis and Butt head shoot really nips like a tiny little black shoe yeah I'm not trying to wear a big clumpy sneaker yeah we're not those kind of girls we're not Ella Emhoff mm-hmm we can't pull that kind of macaroni stuff off but the guy the doorman kind of like freaked out at me and was like can we have a moment because they were clearly having some kind of it wasn't even one of those things where they were trying to be like exclusive and rude they were clearly just having some kind of like spat in the store I was like okay weird and then he opened the door like not even like two seconds later I thought they were gonna keep me out there for like 15 minutes did you go anywhere else in so how brandy I went to mango you went to mango you now so you nasty and other stories which I also hate I actually was taking a shower before I came over here and I was using my and other stories body scrub mm-hmm and I was like I got to talk about this on the pod because they do have great body scrub and a little goes a long way and it's yes like and for the price point is nice and the sense are like kind of elegant and like Scandinavian packaging is pretty well done ladies and other stories do yourself a favor and pick up some and other stories body scrub and makeup and nail polish and it's not Chanel but it's a reasonable dupe I'm a little mistrustful for some reason of the cosmetics but I bet they're fine they're fine they're like adequate they're serviceable the body scrub is great it's great and the candles are good candles are I used to give those candles out like stalking stuffers as presents wow cuz they're beautiful but they're not you know they're not like by Rito or diptych candles that cost an arm and a leg my diptych budget is is out of control yeah and other stories is a is a underutilized resource the clothing I don't think I've ever bought so hideous little fitting socks I think I've gotten some cute weird socks there but yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't go for the the apparel yeah the clothing is weird the shoes are hideous she seemed like they'd fall apart yeah but that's how you know we're not getting paid by another story no we're telling you it real yeah we're not gonna be in one of their little they don't want a front page editorials they don't want us but that's okay I'll keep buying that garbage yeah but no but to your point I've just noticed kind of just a shocking precipitous decline in merchandising in quality and customer service well there's supply chain issues we know that mm-hmm we are in a recession even if they change what that word means supply chain issues and inflation and yada yada whatever how does that contribute to people not being able to fold clothing properly on the shelf well morale is low people just don't care they don't care they don't have any incentive to I mean which is crazy because people had no incentive to really care about anything they did there either it's like the weird like shadow Soviet Union where instead of there being not enough crap there's like too much crap yeah it's like really merchandise and low quality and it's crazy cuz like if you go to LA they're bizarrely kind of a holdout of the American dream still and things are they literally have a mall called American dream right no that's in the Americana yeah never mind I stand corrected but they the merchandising in the LA or its ears and brandy's is impeccable okay yeah brandy is always I mean brandy is like evergreen and the merchandising there is the same always because it's already just like a teenage girls bedroom like strewn with crap anyway exactly it's very low it's low maintenance there's like panties everywhere like little hair ribbons yeah random handbags you know tiny bag yeah anyway this is something that I noticed a long time ago and I got okay boomer for it yeah but it's back in my day they used to fold the clothes back in my day the employees used to look at you I know they would like make eye contact and now but you know it's like my gender goblin latte art polemic mm-hmm people want to think they're oppressed because of their gender racial identity but it's really just because they're unprofessional and bad at their job and that makes customers disgruntled yeah that's why I love Keith McNally you know I love him too I finally hit the follow on oh good Instagram yeah cuz you'll you never know when he's gonna start defending Woody Allen he wakes up randomly one day and he'll just make a long post about how Mia's a liar and everyone knows that and you're like yes Keith has he ever defended Harvey Weinstein no no he has a personal you know he's a fan of what he is I see and Melinda and Melinda was filmed a scene in pasties actually and that's an anecdote he likes to tell a lot about how he gave Woody a great deal on filming at pasties and he was so nice he's very handsome I didn't realize yeah oh yeah yeah especially I think Michael Douglas should play him in a movie Michael Douglas would like yeah jump for a plumb roll where he gets to play a stroke victim think about it he'd be great yeah well I would really want to focus on the rise of his restaurant yeah but we could get Michael Douglas in there in the well even you know he didn't eat a restaurant until he was like 17 years old Keith McNally Keith McNally why cuz he grew up he was like a poor English boy so he's like Paul Schrader yeah he's a total like provincial who broke through yeah like Alex Jones became the most celebrated shock jock restaurant so cool I love I love a good American dream story like that yeah makes me happy totally like that that's I mean I guess that happened a long time ago but he is writing a memoir that's great fantastic writer yeah yeah but yeah you can't that kind of thing isn't so likely to happen nowadays no yeah it's very hard to break through I don't know things are things are changing if my horrible nightmares are any indication sooner rain's gonna come watch these streets clean ultimate race war orchestrated by China oh yeah China so Nancy Pelosi really did it huh did what I confused when I was reading all these headlines I confused Taiwan with Thailand and I was like oh she's on her like Wellbeck sex tourism kick and getting a happy ending she's visiting Prince Andrew yeah yeah I I was listening to I just want to give a shout out before I launch into my Caribbean rhythm spiel I want to give a shout out to Jordan who I met on the street who is a red scare fan and I'm doing that primarily because I feel incredibly guilty because he asked for a photo and I said absolutely not and then he was like oh my god are you on the phone and I was like I lied and said I was but in fact I was listening to Caribbean rhythms episode 115 I was riveted and yeah glued shout out to Jordan yeah he was thanks for trying yeah very cute and sweet oh anyway I was listening to episode 115 of Caribbean rhythms and he speculates that Nancy Pelosi was in Taiwan too she went there for quote the joys of total obliteration of ego and high-grade Taiwanese type liquor and stinky tofu but I think that this is an overly masculine read and he's talking about what he would do if he were in her place sure I think she went there to get her turkey gobbler clipped I think she went there to do corruption took to corrupt yeah yeah but in my fantasy world she went there to get like weird Korean plastic surgery even though it's not anywhere in your Korea no and was just like convalescing poolside well that's I think that's why an umbrella with one of those drinks with a tiny umbrella in it I think that's why Joe Biden keeps getting COVID is because he's like he's dead he's either dead or recovering from intense of plastic surgery yeah he's getting a face he's like one of those K-pop stars I told you this right like when I did my deep dive my like autistic like 3 a.m. dive into like the K-pop industry and K-pop stars like you didn't tell me that no I was like this was several months ago and I was like reading about like BTS and black pink yeah yeah and every single one of their entries on Wikipedia has a health section which is weird for celebrities imagine like you know like Brad Pitt like Bruce Willis they don't have like a health yeah right and it's like Jimine or whatever bam bam yeah bam bam temporarily stopped touring with Dover Street Market Boys to address his issues of anxiety or he broke a wrist during intense choreography and had to go to physical therapy and it's like no no no they were getting facelifts they were getting lip fillers yeah they were like K-pop love yeah they were definitely getting plastic surgery getting facial feminization I just picture like Pelosi with like you know bleeding from the bandage on her head I don't even know what else she could get she is so like pinched and like taught you know that I don't even know what I was wearing like a praying bikini over her oiled up big natural I'm only the second oldest woman to ever wear a prank it's Nancy Pelosi can you imagine that would really don't sorry but maybe you get the AI to generate that probably okay here's my request I'm really tired and really drunk and you're drunk I'm ready drunk I'm so I mean I started earlier than you can one of you lovely listeners please do a convincing Photoshop of Nancy Pelosi wearing the praying bikini we would love to see we would love to see that it's like Kate Moss yeah then printed on some shirts saw them on Reddit thank you just like a square so why did she go to Taiwan because they're doing because I'm to do diplomacy but China really didn't want her to go yeah China didn't China was basically begging her not to go and she did it anyway and they said like you are like Derek Chauvin with your boot on our neck they basically can't breathe they said we're not George Floyd you can't just strangle us at your whim or something they said something so Chinese and cool I love when when a China goes woke because it's like one of your like a twisted fever dreams it's like a premonition of what's to come which is we all get that vivisected and in a bear cage yeah at the dick-sucking factory rockin after and the Chinese will no no no you don't understand China's is based and trad and it's like you don't want to know about the Chinese they're on a whole different way yeah they're not like us they're really really they don't know they don't Chinese people don't know their birthdays and they don't heard and they put their last names first yeah they have they have no respect for human rights for for the well that goes without saying because that's that's like an byproduct of post enlightenment Western liberal individualism mm-hmm which is really like our state-sponsored religion it's not like wokeness or anti-racism or whatever those are also byproduct right and it's like frankly this is why I'm I'm a racist centrist because I would rather believe in that than China then like the kind of Russian slash Chinese collectivism yeah I mean that shit's not for me no no no that's a no-brainer I like being an individual at the end of the day I know much as I rail against it that's lived hard Anna yeah but seriously stop Asian hate okay it's valid wait what's valid to be like a staunch anti-individualist Chinese task master who makes you work in a I mean we can respect it much like we can respect Crump's artistry it's a separate thing that's somewhat alien to us yeah we don't know how he does it yeah but we can understand but we like to see it we can we can dial in we can tap into the wavelength yeah and we can understand that this is an alternate worldview or value system that I personally just like want no part of yeah I'm not a Maoist or whatever what is a Maoist it's like when you're a communist and you want peasants to rule I don't know yeah but that's right that's that's what it is it's like rule by peasant class yeah I mean this is like yeah the work of the working class the peasant class this is also such a like a fake and gay like a red herring of course always it just like also that's that's something else smart that I wrote down oh yeah I'm just gonna quote him he said communism is not a political program it is a civilizational orientation the economic program is a fig leaf how do we do it we agitate the working class and I felt very seen and heard at that moment because somebody put words to this like vague and indistinct like a feminine feeling that I've always had that like it's not really about empowering the working class it's about weaponizing them yeah it's about weaponizing them because there's no such thing as rule by the many as all of our research Machiavelli as what's his name by the boss come on yeah I think yeah God we're stupid man we yeah we shouldn't be allowed to talk no no but it's and you can whip people up into a frenzy by heightening their class conscious yeah and then you have like whatever the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and millions of nameless faceless peasants die yeah dead in a ditch or worse anyway stay tuned for more of our I just remember being a little girl my mom being like man on the horse and a woman like Baba and you know she's right she's totally yeah and it's interesting you can't you can't trust a spiritual autogynophile like now who's saying a lot actually really yeah I remember back in the day what was that book she was saying right right right right right next to your 911 Commission report yeah I think I have it somewhere actually I don't know where it is but I got a new Muji bookshelf that I'm very proud of it so cute it's really balanced the room and that will wait only the Japanese can do I sorry I'm trying to find weirdly now that we're talking about Saddam Hussein I finally understood what he meant by that though even he doesn't quite understand what he means I think he just means also this thing that Saddam and Gaddafi and Taleb and all Middle Eastern men share which is that they're metrosexuals yeah they'll backhand you with their perfectly manicured hand well a lot of Arab guys are like that no offense to love yeah I can't find it wait what were you looking for it's like Alice Miller wrote a thing I forget which book it's in but I had a good a photo that I took of it where she talked about Saddam Hussein's childhood and how horribly abused he was by his I was like the astrologer and then I realized you know Susan Miller Susan yeah I'm gonna read her she did Saddam Hussein Saddam Hussein's horoscope was he in Aries good question we should look this up return to form grab our phones I'll let you do it Saddam Hussein 28 April what's that Taurus that's Aries Taurus cuss wow damn of course I could see him being a kind of a Taurus because he's like he was very much a home body he looked in his like he liked the finer mansion yeah where he like masturbated to American westerns materialistic grounded they caught they got that other 9-11 by the way did you know I'm an Elza here yeah yeah they got his ass I love how they rolled that out like 20 years later okay whatever and what a sad way to die to how they got it I mean they probably drone-striked him but he didn't go out and like the original wave of glory of murder it was really I knew it was over for America when Barack Obama extra judicially drone Osama bin Laden through his body in the ocean why'd you know it was over for America then that's weird yeah it is weird yeah to like cap a guy in front of his wives and children and see Barry yeah and do like a victory laugh about yeah but I mean people really celebrated that I mean 9-11 was really bad you know yeah that's true but like we have to we had to do something but you had to just get like the level of involvement in 9-11 Saddam Hussein was like Saddam Hussein wasn't that wasn't Saddam Hussein sorry Osama bin Laden yeah I'm getting confused by all the Middle Eastern I mean Osama bin Laden was like I don't know the door man like the guy who checks the IDs you think so yeah he was like a financier if that he wrote some checks but still they tried to turn him into this like quote Lex Luthor style mastermind I don't buy it I mean I don't really remember yeah because I didn't even I was too young yeah let alone you yeah I was so confused there's a lot so much going on in the post 9-11 era and of course I mean of course much like with China they were saying one thing but doing another thing behind closed doors of course yeah enabling emboldening and the media just lied about those WMD they did they sure did yeah they just they had no qualms that was a good old time yeah but something had to be done you know yeah I guess do you think 9-11 was an inside job I mean do I think the election is rigged in one way or the other mm-hmm there was some nudging going on some coercion there was probably information yeah do I think it was orchestrated kind of intentionally and immediately at the higher levels of American government probably not yeah but it was much much worse because it was the turn to blind eye too yeah which is yeah which is like the kind of election stuff that people like really hate when I talk about what it's like alright I don't care about the weird ballot stuffing and ballot counting and having like a 28 year old Jewish female social workers fill out ballots for like inner city black people and like dead senior citizens yeah when the whole it's not about that it's not about that when it's really not about that that's that's kind of like a minor part of it all when the whole system the whole yeah discursive whatever what do you call it like the whole kind of apparatus yeah if you will is tipped in the favor like the scales are tipped in the favor of one all encompassing all powerful ideology over another like of course the whole thing is rigged it's like spiritually rigged yeah they never had it yeah they never stood a chance and I mean ponds in the chessboard of life and it's just I don't know you really think it's not rigged wake up you know why wouldn't it be what do you bait what what faith what is your faith in the democratic process like based on that you think you have some that isn't totally warped by your politics that needs to believe Joe Biden one you know why wouldn't it be I mean not just one girl's opinion but yeah I'm just like I don't believe that I don't think people would come out in droves for Joe Biden I mean people really wanted to return to yeah but there's no massive decent you know he was not and he remains to be a very unpopular I don't believe that there's any mass support for Joe Biden no but he was just sort of propped up as the the alternative yeah and I bet he didn't get a lot of votes you know yeah I'm sure he got I don't think they swept no yeah I'm sure they didn't but close call lots of questions whatever we're never gonna get to the bottom of it do you think Nathan fielder is manipulative what did that guy write that he was Brody yeah the New Yorker guy he wrote kind of yeah a review that he had it like a rehearsal mean and nasty gaze yeah he said as a filmmaker fielder displays interest not in any physical process unfolding over time but in his own intellectual process in the authentic ingenuity of the working out of his conceit which the onscreen events merely exemplify like data points rather than experiences he revels in his own thoughts as he tailors the conditions of his subjects lives to fit his storytelling largely through his own voiceover so this is a review of the new Nathan fielder show the rehearsal rehearsal where he does a kind of Nathan for you ish thing where he helps people who volunteer to be on the show kind of rehearse moments in their life that they have apprehension or anxiety about in this kind of like autistic quest to kind of like account for all the variables to get something right you know oh this is so the article is called the cruel and arrogant gaze of Nathan fielder's the rehearsal yeah so he stands accused of being quote cruel and quote arrogant and yeah the premise of the show is like he recruits volunteers from Craigslist which I have a hard time believing people don't know who Nathan fielder is I mean I guess some people might not and but he's basically calm doing what's like commonly referred to or known as a version therapy but this time filming it all for the benefit of you the viewer sure right I mean that's well in the second episode in the second episode when he's helping that woman who wants to have a child yeah you didn't finish it but he ends up co-parenting with her right so then he like kind of inserts himself into into the narrative of the show I think it's brilliant I'm really I'm a lot of thoughts I thought it was interesting that the author of the New Yorker piece gave two examples of other kind of like conceptual postmodern documentary and they were both notably from the 60s which is when this kind of like meta gaze took hold right so that was interesting when he says by contrast the rehearsal plays like a multi-part embodiment of the joke or Jack Handys or Steve Martin's before you criticize a man walk a mile in his shoes that way when you do criticize him you'll be a mile away and have his shoes and the guys can see is that fielder's main real life steak is the one on screen making the show a success the vanity and the ambition of the rehearsal arts driving forces and yeah I mean I found myself nodding along to the article points because I've always found Nathan fielder's quote gaze to be just like a touch mean spirited and punching down really well hold on okay okay okay okay analysis Eli mentioned this to me a while back he pointed it out a while back and ever since then like I can't and see it but I also think there kind of kernel of truth there is to that he's so smart and so talented that it exceeds this like kind of imperious mean spirited gaze he has a little I mean it doesn't feel mean necessarily mean spirited to me it feels a little like autistic yes I like how the author of the New Yorker piece called him gimlet-eyed it was like very like on point but to me it's very obvious that the endeavor that he's like undertaking is like kind of as probably a kind of if not like truly on you know the actor I don't know what his autism quotient is but like it's definitely there's something wrong with Nathan fielder like he's brilliant but like sure yeah there's some kind of like emotional impediment there and he as an artist is like struggling to bridge that gap through this kind of project that he's undertaken and I sort of feel like when people I get what people mean because these people I don't I I kind of do sense like an underlying empathy sort of for his subjects yeah that I think someone like Richard Brody right doesn't experience because he has real contempt for the critic he's generous yeah all these critics they project their own lack of generosity onto these kind of artists making work yeah and like I understand that impulse as a person who's like a hybrid somewhere between a critic and an artist right yeah both of those impulses but in watching this it's not so much that Nathan fielder is contemptuous of people it's that he is somewhat indifferent which is much sadder he uses people as a utility which frankly all artists do they have to they have to right and again people in Nathan fielder's cosmos yeah are not the targets they're the collateral of his artistic process and it's very well said his artistic process transcends the immediate ethics or morality of the situation especially if these people have agreed if they've given their consent and I'm sure they signed a bunch of like NDAs and releases right of course of course it's not like they were you know well the guy that he on the second episode who he tries to set up initially I think her name is Angela yeah Robin the guy yeah who's like like a weird like numerology Protestant guy who's like comes off poorly sure but I read an interview he did kind of like advice where he says he attempts to kind of like tell his side of the story but ultimately like bolsters sort of the impression made of him on on the show in the end you know it's like it doesn't I don't think he was even really that I don't think anyone is really unfairly being depicted or manipulated the way that they're done on like probably less so even then people are on like routine like any reality TV show you know I mean Zway show he's not plowing them with alcohol or like yeah but that show is the same thing but much cruder and less redeeming because it's I've never watched it I've I've watched like clips of it and it's like it really is like kind of like a one version of like Nathan fielder's vision and like you I mean there's so much like if you look at like the amount of work like the production value the the set replicas all the paid actors doing like weird kind of like preemptive like guerrilla warfare yeah to like expedite this like the third episode situation I didn't watch the third episode you'll you should it's it's good the reason that what's the same Richard Brody the reason that a guy like that would call it mean the reason why I spared it again is because all like liberals and leftists have the same problem which is they confuse description and judgment and evaluation they project their own emotions yeah on to neutral scenarios this this scenario is not exactly neutral right but they project their own kind of like contempt well that's yeah that's what I'm saying like Richard Brody has a low opinion of Nathan fielder subjects so when he sees them being vulnerable or instrumentalized in some way he blames Nathan fielder for the little he experiences exactly right and like it's very apparent I mean Nathan fielder may or may not have those exact same feelings about those people but that's irrelevant and I I don't know maybe I'm being a little naive but I really don't think he does and I think you know the fact that he does choose I mean even on like Nathan for you the final like the finale of that show with that like bull gates impersonator I feel like there's like who's also kind of like a weird spectrum performer like I feel like they're even the choice of his subjects I feel like I can sense like a kind of like radical affiliation with them or something like he's beautiful I like that he he chooses people who are weird maladjusted misfits and losers because he's always felt like a weird maladjusted misfit and loser and he you know is yeah and he's smoking hot Nathan fielder it's shocking to look at him in motion because like there's this whole like you know backlog of people being like you know it looks like Nathan fielder which is by the way a joke I made like four years ago but actually he like literally does look like me and he has the same like Casper from eastbound and down like wet lift autistic stare and like his skin is aging in the same way like the nasal labial laxity and I'm just like this is this is me he's just like me for real and like the way that his hair falls is very me with the mullet is like crazy yeah maybe that's why I'm so drawn to you your type yeah but he really like he reveals kind of like the depths in the show he merely speaks the truth right he reveals the depths of people's delusions like when that guy core in the first episode is that his name says that he wouldn't miss a night of trivia for a confession or when the girl Angela in the second episode it is making up all these excuses for why she won't match with men on right the internet yeah and he like basically like lays bare people's kind of like delusions and defense mechanisms which is painful for other people such as us to watch because we can empathize with that because we do it ourselves exactly and like I think like it reveals also through kind of an elaborate simulation like the fake sets and the fake rituals the elaborate rationalizations and intense overthinking that people engage in to avoid conflict and confrontation very well said and by revealing it it lays bare it exposes how absurd it is to other people for instance like I thought the first episode was really good when he finally confesses his lie that he has a master's degree when in fact he's only gotten a bachelor's to his friend of 20 years she doesn't care she doesn't care at all and in fact she says kind of flippantly like oh it's so brave of you oh that's fine yeah she doesn't care and the sad thing in that moment for me was that she actually like these two people are like circling around each other they've been friends for 20 years but they actually have not achieved any intimacy because she literally does not care that he lied to her yeah that's like the depressing yeah kind of like and the brilliance of Nathan fielder is that he forces us to ponder these very heavy questions in a lighthearted and humorous way yeah exactly you can laugh a little learn something along the way I don't know I mean I am also very drawn to I feel like people on the spectrum due to my own kind of spurgy tendencies and I think it's like I'll really I really will talk to any like to anybody to kind of any like especially like about like Catholicism or something I'll talk to any like yeah weird guy about it and day or night you know but I think what I really just like talking to random racists and pedophile yeah they're my friends yeah um no but I think I'm you know I'm drawn to or have a spot a soft spot for kind of the archetypal spur is because they have to work so much harder much like Nathan fielder I suspect has to to make those like to to bridge perhaps to make those emotional kind of connections and that a lot of people now exist on some version of like an autism spectrum nowadays you know because the the categorical behavior has like expanded so much to just kind of the way people basically are right wait where do you like even if someone isn't like diagnosed autistic I feel like our times are so autistic and especially young people who you know are getting worse screen time in as a child and stuff like that's true but also I think I hate the word autistic as like yeah I mean so much because you know like I do that like classic female like who me I'm just a small bean like thing where I'm like oh yeah I went down an autistic rabbit all researching kpop stars or like AIDS in South Africa and like that's not autism that's just basic common curiosity and interest which all people have in them of course yeah but now it's like lame and gay admit that you're like basically interested in certain topics that might be kind of like weird or off the beaten path you don't think people are getting as a whole more emotionally unintelligent yeah no totally I mean I think that people have completely lost touch with like human nature yeah are incapable of socializing I mean I said this like many many episodes ago it's shocking when you talk to young people they don't ask questions they only talk about themselves Eugene was saying this we I went to a party with Eugene that was like well I initially actually thought very like I was like these kids must be like in college or fresh out or something I was like they seemed so young to me but a lot of them I think we're like in like 28 and I kind of was like oh y'all kind of too old to be actually but yeah then when we left Eugene kind of was like zoomers are so like autistic yeah they have such a hard time like communicating and just basically a bad manner they're just like emotionally and socially amputated it's really shocking and it's not their fault it's again it's like an informational technological problem it's obviously very widespread it just the kind of like lack of metacognition and self awareness is shocking I mean there's actually a lot of metacognition and self awareness devoted to like plumbing the depths of your own self and personality and faults and failures you're kind of this kind of introspective thing but like to me when I like when I go out in public as like Anna the the IRL person and not like the online persona it's like a no brainer it's a Machiavellian strategic note to a avoid politics and be asked people questions about themselves yeah to avoid talking about yourself and say their name because people to say their name to ask them how much they hate their parents because it's you know inevitably they're very flattered by that ask them if they ever wake up screaming then you can divert the conversation away from your own yeah I'm shocking to talk to people who are like in their late teens early 20s like I said because they are incapable of like experiencing or empathizing anything that's not well I think they are I just think it's that there's a space between what they're experiencing and what they're able to like project that I think it really is like on the social level like etiquette level like there's like a communication breakdown maybe yeah but there's a loss of because I also think young people are incredibly sense you know I do think and you know I feel like they are incredibly sensitive much like you know people in the autism spectrum also have like very heightened sensitivity yeah it's just that they are so overly sensitive to it that they're like amputated by it as you said yeah yeah yeah you know and like really truly like there there's a loss of intelligence like in the kind of conventional standardized way like people they don't like read canonical texts they don't learn about history etc etc there's also a loss of intelligence on the social front which is more important I think it's way more important it's more important yeah because that's actually like you know the social skills or what's gonna like actually keep you safe people don't understand other people and Nathan fielder is doing kind of valuable public service yeah cloaked or guys as comedy or art and maybe he doesn't understand no but he's reckoning with that at least yeah you know I mean he he describes his reasoning at the start of episode one where he says if you plan for every variable a happy outcome doesn't have to be left a chance and I thought that was like a very weird thing to say right because as he later admits sort of like the moral the story is that you can't eliminate uncertainty yeah without resorting to an ethical means without you know cheating at trivia to give the obvious topical example but in a roundabout way he like really illuminates why it is that people lie whether to themselves or others which is which is what good art should do yeah cause you to evaluate all the lies that are piling up yeah and they and they mentioned like Willy Wonka and he he really is like a Willy Wonka like figure yeah do you think will do you did you consider Willy Wonka to be villainous no I thought I've I've always thought of Willy Wonka he makes an example out of his children kind of like Alex Jones to figure shock jock yeah he's like a court jester or a sad clown yeah he's in that chocolate factory he's actually more like accurately like a Roger Stone type figure because he dresses like Nathan J Robinson well Roger Stone I think stole that from Willy Wonka but that's why he was portrayed by the twisted soul of Johnny Depp yeah and just like you know what is like conceptually interesting is often morally dubious sorry like yeah Nathan Fielder like reveals this kind of like very fraught terrain of ethics there's no such thing as like a pure and uncomplicated ethics yeah totally like it is it is a very like Christian Catholic outlook in the end because in the end this whole concept that that we throw around very lightly like everyone's a sinner everybody lives in sin it's very true because if you do think X it has certain externalities and consequences right you can never do anything like pure in a vacuum that results in like unanimous goodness and positivity right and even if you could you'd probably feel proud of yourself which would just yeah bring you right back to being a total sinner yeah somewhere somehow someone else will suffer yeah for your good will do you know who Mayo Thompson is no he like put out this record in the 70s I went and saw him like I pre pandemic it must have been I guess he's like an old man now he like but he performed he's still alive I think so unless he's died recently should be really sad I hope he's I hope he is but I he read this poem at the end and he where he said and I remember it really because it was short but he said the poem he was like I wrote this poem the other day and it was my happiness depends at least in part on others disappointment and I was like that's that old man wisdom that's like something you really got to be mad old time is that yeah your happiness your efforts inevitably will depend on or lead to someone else's disappointment right and like Nathan fielder wields a very it's a fundamentally very Jewish vision mm-hmm like it's no accident that that that Jews are obsessed with psychoanalysis mm-hmm and like this show actually reminded me of the work of another psychoanalysis inspired Jewish artist Peter back yeah well the crumbs piece yeah it didn't make me also think of the Brody piece mm-hmm as like yeah he's sort of like takedowns of the cruelty right some spectacle that they couldn't take their eyes off you're right it was similar in that it was I think it was actually genuine and well meaning mm-hmm and well written mm-hmm and well he's not at the New Yorker for nothing kind of nothing I mean I'm referring to crumps that are goals also like he's a good writer this Brody guy he's fine yeah it was entertaining yeah he's a you know he's not a disreputable critic I've never heard of him are you familiar with this I am because I've been in indie movies and made a film where I was like we're trying to get that Brody review but okay did he redo it no okay you know when I was reading crumbs piece it like dawned on me as like oh like Peter has possibly achieved something really remarkable which is simulate your kind of average your typical online space IRL right which was the point that's the point and it's shocking how everybody missed that it's crazy and then they all pile yeah then then the the piece became viral yeah in this like medic commentary yeah and he lays bare also the perversion and absurdity of what being online feels like and it's very funny that he has like Nick Mullen and Curtis Yorvin and Honor Levy and all these like luminaries of our like annoying and depressing little online ghetto in the room yeah placed in the audience like stars studying the sky that's what being online feels like right you log on and you see like a Nick Mullen tweet or you see people arguing about what Curtis Yorvin meant by that yeah and you briefly think about these people and then you just as quickly forget about them and go about your daily life until you're until you're inevitably reminded of them again yeah until they chime in which we're all incentivized to do in like an attention economy which yeah yeah you know all the world's a stage it is yeah and he's specifically he kind of like simulated like the pile on orchestrated by your typical online mob right yeah and I don't know orchestrated is even the right word because it often feels so like organic and unconscious it felt like it happened pretty organically I mean so then Yorvin wrote his like response to the Crumbs piece Lorenzen wrote a response to the Crumbs he's forest fucking made a sub stack because he was an extra that day he wrote like his own subjective account of that day I was like wow this this has done wonders for the sub stack economy right well yeah but I mean this whole thing is a form of mutual aid it's everybody like a mooching press and clout off of each other that's not even I don't mean that in like a mean I don't think that's debatable yeah but like perversion and absurdity are the operative terms because the internet is not an aberration from normal human relations it's an extreme normal human relations amplification yeah yeah it's you know perversion and absurdity are not aberrations they're they're extremes on a spectrum right well to circle back to China real quick um y'all know China made tick tock right they sure did yeah and the way people use and look at tick tock like being around because there were a lot of you know George Floyd is actually a chinese hologram originally debuted on tick tock my Alex Jones moment um you can't sue me for 180 million because guess what I ain't got it yeah we don't have we don't have this kind of fun but our patreon is available um oh I forgot what I was going to say no you were talking to China made tick tock oh yeah um a lot of young people worked on Peter's movie so I was around you know an unprecedented amount sort of of um younger younger people and yeah they're all on tick tock everyone's on tick tock which I really think was basically designed to compromise the fabric of our society personally yeah I'm like this is my real like okay boomer thing is it makes me feel like overstimulated and like autistic it's even like look at it so I don't personally participate but it does seem like a very like uh toxic chinese mechanism to turn us all into foot soldiers of the regime who know yeah or just to make us like morally and intellectually like stunted and weak yeah no I mean for sure and I don't think it's like necessarily like a conspiracy or coordinated but that's the effect it has so it doesn't really matter in the end one of the funniest things um the to come out of this was people complaining how the kind of dime square scene wishes it was the warhol factory scene but they're not even they're not cool like people were in the people don't think Andy Warhol was mean he was like far less talented and creative and like that that like you think those people were any different you think those people weren't depraved and decrepit junkies and provocateurs and opportunists you know they're lucky that they all died of AIDS when they did but it was too far they're like in case you know they're like those in those key chains of insects encased in amber yeah they're forever like um memorialized yeah no one's gonna eat said you're like a trust fund kid but she was transcended through time and nostalgia into like another another thing but you think that those people had more of like a artistic vision of or moral compass they sure as hell didn't yeah being they were doing the equivalent of like shitposting at the factory basically you know yeah they were like Warhol was one of the first shit posters yeah they just seemed cooler as a buddy Jack the perfume national said because they were captured on 16 millimeter instead of tweeting all day it's easy to preserve mystique yeah yeah and now we see them on the big screen at like Metrograph and we think my those people they were really glamorous and cool and it's like that's that's the funniest thing about this for me it's like people throughout time are basically the same as far as their kind of motivations and objectives go their circumstances and therefore their values change throughout time but they're kind of like baseline nature doesn't really I yeah I would agree with that like no point yeah the vast majority of people are like more or less like nice but you know secretly competitive and covetous and we're all guilty of like bad thoughts toward ourselves and our comrades yes absolutely like come on now that's why we do the struggle session I'm just kidding um no it's true I hate to break it to you but those people were out chasing scum too I don't know again it's like it's literally like not a matter of ideology it's a matter of information aka technology it's just that we're dealing with a different set of circumstances yeah that we're responding to inform you know and hopefully Russia fries the power grid any day so all that stuff will just go away totally then we'll have a whole new set of problems to deal with like what marauding games yeah yeah the total societal collapse if those if those girls at Starbucks don't get paid there's gonna be hell to pay Demi Lovato not much to say we called it you know Demi Lovato people were mad or something no I'm asking because it also reminds me of that the iconic quote from bronze age mindset where he says something to the effect of like if leftist started lifting they'd stop being leftists immediately yeah so I'm guessing something happened in her life that made her feel like thinner and prettier that's um well here's a quote from people magazine in response to a question asking Lovato to explain the concept of chosen pronouns like they them the 29 year old singer songwriter said yeah so they them is she's 29 yeah she seems much older yeah I've actually adopted the pronouns of she her again she continued for me I'm such a fluid person that I felt like especially last year my energy was balanced in my masculine and feminine energy so that when I was faced with the choice of walking into a bathroom and it said women and men I didn't feel like there was a bathroom for me because I didn't feel necessarily like a woman I didn't feel like a man I just felt like a human that's cool there is a bathroom for you it's called like the single occupancy so that yeah that was the level of reasoning that went into the they them yeah pronouns that we all definitely have to really respect and bless her totally use and I'm happy to hey I'll say I'm okay with using the pronouns now too I'll work yeah I'll I'm telling you something really came over me recently and I was just like I love and accept everybody and respect their creativity all the world's a stage and I get what you're doing and the men and women merely players and yeah and everyone has their part pigs blood yeah God is a plan for everyone and we're all doing a great great job considering we're doing the best we can considering the apocalyptic atmosphere yeah there are some people that really do remain on my shit list okay good yeah yeah you don't want to get too too soft too too too permissive no no but I can't say their names on this podcast because I think that that would be like needless and unnecessary shit don't do it well I feel like I summoned crumps into into my life in a way we all did we all did because we are not my problem I don't you don't care I don't care yeah but I do want to debut my theory that I do that he's an autogynophile yeah because he has that strong jaw brow ridge and and Chad jaw he's yeah he looks like he was born to wear an ill-fitting way and that's probably why he didn't like Betsy's movies so much right it struck a chord because he was jealous of Peter and how gorgeous he looked in his in his costume I think it was important to the integrity of the film that Peter is barely passing definitely well Peter's character isn't okay this is the thing is Peter's character is not trans like in that movie neither are any of these guys who are like transitioning in mass now well guys I guess it depends sort of categorically where you want to place autogynophiles you know this is a new class this is not like a Rachel Levine or Caitlin Jenner type of situation I don't know Caitlin Jenner is a little you know certainly put you know has the resources to put in to passing right but is also I think motivated out of like being poisoned by like the black Armenian magic of his like cohort you know I mean back when yeah back when it was Bruce you know yeah now it's Caitlin it's just being outnumbered by yeah and the advantages of being a woman in that context like like getting all the attention no having none of the responsibility exactly seems like a great a great day who wouldn't want that I mean yeah but anyway that's my theory and just like a vibe that it's a vibe I he's yeah I don't know I can't I can't I can't speak on that okay but I think just to put this out there I don't mind crumbs I think he's like kind of a good writer and has an artistic streak and I can I can respect his game I get what he's doing he is valid and he is allowed in our spaces I mean he what he kind of neglected to mention or sort of glossed over in his write-up was that we there was sort of a shift after what he called kind of like the gay kumbaya moment where everyone was like speaking from the heart where there was sort of like I really did I skimmed and I didn't don't please don't read it but the there was a dialectical turn if you will where people were like actually like you know we think crumbs is like scapegoating us by calling us fascists but we are actually kind of like we're scapegoating him now as like the embodiment of like this amorphous like cancel culture or something and like we're lashing out at him and we're sorry but people were saying like I said I'm sorry like people said sorry like we didn't meet you know and like commended him for like sitting sitting through it and like we're and I saw him afterwards and he was happy and when I told him no one would believe him he left so I was mistaken as you know maybe I do come off like a weird fucked up bitch and don't realize it but I think I was being nice yeah I mean you assume that people meet you well that's the mistake we keep making with with crumbs and I yeah I don't want to talk about him because no no it's okay I can also like edit this out no we've talked about him we've talked about him we've just bleep bleep his name out the subsack but this whole critique that like these people like stand for nothing and don't have any politics and just love to say slurs and play it fascism because they're provocateurs and edgelords and whatever who want tension that's a hundred percent true it is for for most of the people in in that scene yeah probably sure I mean not everyone's like and that's fine what I'm saying is that it's not much of a critique because it's fine that's like normal and not a big deal yeah people acting out and being naughty who cares it's a milieu thing you wouldn't you wouldn't get it yeah it's a downtown NYC neo fascist thing like the vast majority of you know I said to Dean Kissick on Twitter it's like a Pareto thing right 20% of people are artists and that's being generous that's generous yeah 80% are normies and hangers on yeah and that's fine in any given scene it's it's literally fine not everything has to be like politically motivated and about organization you know and this critique fails because it's fundamentally like the assessment is true but it's pointless yeah it's like a pointless observation yeah sure because they're never gonna care you're applying some kind of like Maoist rubric onto their behavior that they just don't subscribe to right it's not what they're after you know why hold the majority of people in contempt for doing what most people normally do which is like a being impressionable and going with the flow yeah and then kind of quietly opting out of the game and you know working a normal job and or starting a family yeah I mean I also I don't know so we did three days of those sort of like extra shoots and the impression I kind of came away with collectively was sort of like so many people are just they just want to feel something right and like acting is a great way to feel something that's literally the goal so like getting people into a space where they can like improvise and kind of like yeah I use themselves in service of a larger creative vision or something like that's I don't see what's so maybe I'm a real sick fuck but I really don't see what's so so wrong with that and whatever happened to crumps I don't you know I almost can't speak to the ethics of it because I don't have like a civilian approach to it really but I think it wasn't really like I've seen way worse kind of like public relations whatever you want to call them in like acting classes like that's the whole point is to kind of like strip away our ego attachment acting is about obliterating your ego and losing your integrity exactly and he knows me Peter Betsy we're actors we're clearly psychopaths so like don't come to the theater if you don't want something weird to happen like that's why we're all here we're literally trying to have like something that like brushes up against some kind of like real experience yeah but I guess my point is that like most people who inhabit the scene are no different from most people who inhabit any scene or no scene at all in that they're quite morally ordinary in the end not morally bad yeah not morally aberrant but ordinary they're every most people 80% of people probably 90% of people are silent Germans they are very true yeah they'd like to think they're not but this whole thing that like left is to where they seek political justifications everywhere is also like a weird defense mechanism totally yeah against their feelings of like alienation and maladjustment there's some weird Jungian thing going on here where he hasn't like integrated his own shadow or something yeah and I think yeah I mean Peter's movie is very shadow like he is as like a lifelong analizand I think Peter and Betsy both have extraordinary kind of understanding of like shadow stuff and that's valid y'all well they're weird little freaks yeah and that's I don't I like that about them me too me too can you imagine I'm like so relieved when I meet people who are like invested in plumbing the depths of human nature yeah it's so like rare you know should we talk about the mom life comics or have we done enough well okay let's do should we do mom life comics or monkey pox either or up to you let's do mom life because I feel like monkey pox is gonna be with us for a while so we can circle back to that we can exploit it later yeah exactly great idea whereas mom life comics was kind of a flash in the pan I was telling Dasha earlier that I monkey pox I would take that vaccine in a hurry you did say that I was I was shocked honestly but I it is basically just a small pox vaccine right which I think I may be around for a while it's a less experimental technology I would rather die than be disfigured just saying you're also not gonna get monkey pox yeah I could what are you up to come on I'm not having any gay sex yeah really even if I was having lesbian sex which I'm not that wouldn't count because lesbian sex isn't even sex but it's a low and that's a low risk population yeah yeah mom life comics is an Instagram account yeah I don't yeah I just like this is another thing that I we don't have we can call it honestly we've done like an hour and a half practically oh yeah that's not bad yeah I don't really have do you know how many thoughts about mom life comics I think there's some thinly veiled resentment for her husband probably right but maybe not even so you know maybe galaxy brain not so thinly veiled and actually the whole point the peach comic where like the the poorly drawn like Casper mattress ass peach comic where she yeah she sees a right peach and she saves it for her for each cobbler and then he sees a peach and he devours it immediately he puts it in a smoothie and she wants to save it for the kids because she knows how much the kids like peaches and like the other comics if you look kind of at them I have a similar kind of thing where it's like my husband does it this way where he's a totally useless like man who can't stop disappointing me and then I do it this way where I'm you know so true queen yeah I just I have one thing to say about that now that I think about now that I think of it yes there's always some frustration and resentment with men yes going on when you have children and as a matter of fact I was talking to a Shauna Cernovich at the Alex Jones premiere about how she's like he'd be posts a hundred times a day he retweets weird esoteric shit about German indie cinema no but you know we were laughing about how like when you get the baby back from a day with dad he has like food on his face and he's missing a shoe and his shirt is on backwards and because men see buttons and they think they go in the front but for babies they go in the back and yeah it's like annoying sometimes you're jealous of the relative freedom that a man has to go work or fuck off or whatever but this is only possible because we live in a uniquely egalitarian society where men shoulder half if not more of the child care stuff like dead ass the sort of people that we're talking about which are white college educated relatively affluent liberal people who have kids two parent household the best believe the man is doing as much of the cooking and cleaning and diaper changing as the woman yeah I mean there's variants but yeah basically I bet that tracks to me but it's not a patri... like the assumption that this like if it was a patriarchy they wouldn't be allowed to make cartoons they wouldn't be allowed to make poorly drawn Casper Mattress ass cartoons about how men suck and compare clearly she has the time to do that so that's what I'm saying you know yeah I'm trying to be like a yoga instructor I'm not trying to rag on this woman because I like understand where she's coming from and I sympathize with her frustrations but this is only possible because we live in this moment where like the regular labor situation is like evenly split and therefore the domestic labor situation is more or less evenly split well maybe that's partly why she hates her husband so much because she wants to be a real tradwife because he's around all the time and he's not kind of you know he doesn't have that strong strong man hold over the he doesn't have that grumps Chad Jolla or whatever he's not the leash is not he has the neat skis like that to me I think like women would maybe even be better off you know having her husband was less present and less of such a like visible disappointment to her she definitely wouldn't be making no cartoons because she'd be taking care of the kids twice as much she'd be trapped in domestic and sexual bonded because he'd be doing some mad men style stuff yeah he'd have a mistress he'd be splitting time he'd have a second family exactly back in the day men used to have two families my paternal grandpa straight up had two families damn and I was like why would you want that that's double the headache these soy boys today could never um but yeah the last thing I'll say because I think we should wrap it up is that like we've controlled all the social factors that separate the sexes at this point so what you're really mad about ladies is something that's yes unfair but effective life is that just like the biological difference yeah because like guess what gender is real and like women when they hear a baby cry it's painful when men hear a baby cry it's annoying it's a different kind of vibe but babies need both they do need both they need time with dad they need time with mom they need to know that sometimes things are different you know it gives them a variance of experience that is I think healthy for them to have they love it and like thrive in it variety is the spice of life just women are biologically wired in it differently because babies especially in the early stages of their lives are more dependent on women there's no way you can game that men are useless except for like being household health they get useful down the line but initially yeah men can't breastfeed I'm sorry that if that's like a controversial thing to say but like no the mother-infant bond is primary everyone no one yeah could disagree so that's really what you resent it's not your partner it's your biology but maybe you resent it a little more because the the domestic labor is a little too evenly split you know this is true women used to have to be exposed to so many of their partners inadequacies yeah they didn't have to separate spheres but whatever we're not you know contrary to popular belief we're not really actually trad so there's no real going back no it's just it's a new way I believe in bootstrapping and individualism exactly we're Americans at the end of the day and yeah I mean my family love Bellers for a reason and I think I do agree with what this girl Catherine D slash default friend said on Twitter about these comics that like all of the debates about how true or accurate they are are somewhat secondary to their main purpose which is seeking engagement online yeah which is working which is yeah he worked for her yeah it may not have worked out the way that she wanted it to but it worked out one way or another which is weirdly the premise of which is Nathan fielder's new show the rehearsal and Peter Vax upcoming movie www.rachelurman.com um I really I don't know I saw I'll just say I saw a lot of people on reddit being very snarky being like oh Dasha's doing another indie movie blah blah and I'm like I love these people I Peter and Betsy are practically like my family like I spent Christmas like Betsy carried my movie you smell of knowing Peter Christmas with a bunch of Jews I did yeah smoking weed because we all had COVID but we weren't testing positive we all like we're getting negative tests but how did you guys know you had COVID because you just like we were all vaguely sick but like pulling the negative tests and so like they didn't want to go see their parents who usually they would probably spend Christmas with and all of us were kind of like orphaned and um yeah I just spent Christmas with each other because we figured we all had COVID anyway but I yeah I believe in Peter vacs vision which is why I did his movie and also because I love being creative with my effing friends you know sue me I think that man is a genius I think yeah I think he has a vision and I'm here for it yeah actually when I first met Peter vac I was like what a little fuck boy yeah I see why people have so much resentment towards them because they're gorgeous siblings with a close relationship with their parents I don't like to be proven right we like to be vindicated in my like time to time and dismissive appraisals of people I like to be proven wrong I like to I like to know that somebody has um a true artistic vision or ethical code both of which are exceedingly rare very much so and we'll take one or the other yeah they rarely go together they really do anyway see you at home",

should.\"},{\"currTime\":423,\"text\":\"Yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":425,\"text\":\"I'd be like, I'm pregnant\"},{\"currTime\":426,\"text\":\"and the matriot D would have to seat

sure enough.\"},{\"currTime\":541,\"text\":\"He's mad Italian.\"},{\"currTime\":545,\"text\":\"He's the most Italian guy.\"},{\"currTime\":546,\"text\":\"Yeah, not the 91%, that's high, but that's not.\"},{\"currTime\":551,\"text\":\"But as Amber said,\"},{\"currTime\":552,\"text\":\"that's like even more Italian than being 100% Italian.\"},{\"currTime\":556,\"text\":\"Because the real Italians are a little bit.\"},{\"currTime\":558,\"text\":\"Yeah, they're all Balkan dogs.\"},{\"currTime\":560,\"text\":\"Exactly.\"},{\"currTime\":564,\"text\":\"Yeah, there was really no surprises with my

yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":625,\"text\":\"Okay.\"},{\"currTime\":627,\"text\":\"Though you would think that that would reflect in IQ,\"},{\"currTime\":630,\"text\":\"but it really doesn't,\"},{\"currTime\":631,\"text\":\"because she's definitely the smarter one.\"},{\"currTime\":633,\"text\":\"She might be the smarter one, yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":635,\"text\":\"But yeah, she's less Ashkenazi,\"},{\"currTime\":637,\"text\":\"which makes sense,\"},{\"currTime\":638,\"text\":\"because she looks a lot more like my maternal grandmother\"},{\"currTime\":641,\"text\":\"and I look a lot more like my maternal grandfather,\"},{\"currTime\":643,\"text\":\"so I clearly inherited more of his genome or whatever.\"},{\"currTime\":647,\"text\":\"I was like on, immediately took to the DMs\"},{\"currTime\":649,\"text\":\"and was like, Razeeb, tell me more.\"},{\"currTime\":653,\"text\":\"But we can wait to unpack all this,\"},{\"currTime\":655,\"text\":\"because we should just like

do, fellow Christians?\"},{\"currTime\":675,\"text\":\"Yeah, we have, me and Logo have some talking to do\"},{\"currTime\":678,\"text\":\"about the one true church.\"},{\"currTime\":685,\"text\":\"I told Razeeb that he's gonna have to explain\"},{\"currTime\":687,\"text\":\"what recombination and haplogroups are.\"},{\"currTime\":690,\"text\":\"Haplogroups, yes.\"},{\"currTime\":691,\"text\":\"I was looking up the haplogroups\"},{\"currTime\":693,\"text\":\"because they gave me like my maternal haplogroup,\"},{\"currTime\":696,\"text\":\"but then they said.\"},{\"currTime\":698,\"text\":\"23andMe is way better than Ancestry.com,\"},{\"currTime\":702,\"text\":\"I gotta say.\"},{\"currTime\":703,\"text\":\"You should do it.\"},{\"currTime\":704,\"text\":\"And also honestly, you get 20% off a second kit\"},{\"currTime\":706,\"text\":\"so you can get one for Matthew.\"},{\"currTime\":708,\"text\":\"Cute, yeah.\"},{\"currTime\":709,\"text\":\"I was gonna get one for Eli\"},{\"currTime\":713,\"text\":\"because they had this promo going\"},{\"currTime\":716,\"text\":\"and we were fighting at the time\"},{\"currTime\":717,\"text\":\"and he was like, whatever, I don't want a kit.\"},{\"currTime\":720,\"text\":\"So I was like, okay, fine.\"},{\"currTime\":722,\"text\":\"And now he regrets it.\"},{\"currTime\":723,\"text\":\"You're a loss for real.\"},{\"currTime\":725,\"text\":\"Paternal haplogroups identify ancient lines of men\"},{\"currTime\":728,\"text\":\"that all trace back to

    "transcript_text": " Okay. Welcome to my, hello. Okay, hi. Hello. Hi, Anna. Hi, my Persian princess. Yes. Hi, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. Dasha, can you tell them about your sinister actress plan or is it too much? I was just making a cheeky, off-hand comment to Anna about how I'm secretly happy whenever a gorgeous actress transitions because it's less competition for me in the casting pool. Yeah. Hey, girl, you should totally cut your hair. You should get it in more of a, have you thought about being non-binary? You could totally do it. We should get double misactivities for the pod. For my, for our careers. Yeah, and then get like really gorgeous faked head. Like many years later. Yes, smart. Oh, I didn't think that, I didn't think that through. Yeah. Yeah, my plan to be the only bio-female actress left. Yeah, the last women standing. Did someone's got to cast me? Yeah. Someone's got to show whole. I'm like, sir, she's the only one. Roger. Like talking on walkie-talkies and giant industrial hanger. How are you feeling after getting your DNA test results? I'm okay, I'm a little under the weathers. I'm a little run down. I think I have a cold. I don't think it's the cocoa. I've got something too. Yeah, we all do. It's humidifier season. Oh yeah, I should whip out the humidifier. It's been laying dormant. I need to get a new one because I threw my old one out, but it did occur to me today that on my way over, I was like, wow, my lips are so chapped. Mine too. What the fuck? The dry. It's the, once they turn the heat on in New York apartments, then like it really sucks the life out of you. Yeah. I've been walking around like bleeding from my mouth, like Steve Bannon. And I'm just like, no, you don't understand. It's sexy. It's like having thick eyebrows. It's like a specific look. Exactly. I'm being dehydrated in the natural brown. I was telling you when Azalea Banks went off on Kanye. For being dehydrated. And was like, bro, you look dehydrated. You're like naturally beautiful. Black skin looks ashy and gray. I felt so attacked. I felt more attacked in that moment than when she actually attacked me. I was like, oh shit. I'm dehydrated. Cause my skin also do be looking ashy and gray. I'm like the only white person who's ashy. Cause I'm a POC now bitch. Cause you're a Middle Eastern actually. It's Fahan province. I get very sallow. Yeah. We both sort of. Olive undertone queens. True. Yeah. They did, you know, I don't know if Ancestry.com does this, but the Me gives you, like a break down of the physical features that you're genetically likely to have given your makeup. Wow, I need to do 23. It's I think it would be fun. I mean, we have the disposable income just to compare and contrast the results, but they'll tell you like how likely you are to have a certain eye color or detached versus attached or the ratio of your index finger to ring finger, widow's peak, that kind of thing. I forgot where I was going with this. Unibrow. Oh, unibrow, yes, unibrow or no, unibrow. Where something having to do with being Middle Eastern, Ashi. Yeah, I don't remember now. Chronically dehydrated. I feel chronically dehydrated. That's my main, my New Year's resolution. I know it's too early to like lodge those is to just like get more hydrated. Get that humidifier on, girl. I'm telling you. But like how much water do you need to drink? Well, to like get on a baseline level of hydration. Azalea said that it takes two weeks to restore your hydration levels. What the, damn. Sometimes I feel like I'm doing okay. I'm making good progress. I'm like drinking enough water, but then another, you know, it's really varies so drastically from day to day for me. Today I like barely got out of bed. I need to have a baby dude for real. Like I'm playing orange chess. It's like not to drink in no water. Just like looking at pictures of hospital. Got nothing. Yeah, exactly. It's giving child. It's definitely like, yeah, my lips are cracking. Not that I'd be more hydrated if I had a baby. No, you'd be. All these extra. Literally be way less hydrated. I'd have all these extra responsibilities, but it'd be good for me, I think. To have a baby. Yeah, you can really channel all of your deepest ambitions and antisocial qualities into the baby. Yeah. You can finally put the kibosh on like shopping or shoplifting. Shit, I thought you were gonna say shitposting. No. No. I don't know. I'm kind of back to shitposting after a long hiatus. You are, and I'm glad to see it. Yeah. It's... You're not gonna want to shitpost the first year. I hope so. Yeah. That's all it takes to make the posting stop. Well, you know I'm gonna be a real bitch about being pregnant. I can tell. I'm gonna be. You're gonna be like a diva. Yeah, I'm gonna be real hormonal and like, yeah. I don't know. I think you'll be surprised. I mean, if I already can't get out of bed. I mean, I think there's a difference between being a real bitch and being a deliberate self-conscious bitch. Like when I was pregnant, I did make use of my status to get like perks and concessions. Sure. Of course. As you should. Yeah. I'd be like, I'm pregnant and the matriot D would have to seat me or like a business that has, quote, no public restroom would have to let me in the back. I'm pregnant. Yeah. But I think my point is I would be, I would have a lot of time during the pregnancy to devote to hydrating because I'm gonna really need to be super relaxed, super well rested, like basically we'll be able to do a thing, you know. Besides a drink, water, lie down, play chess, play online chess, that's when I'll really hone my skills. Online shop for baby clothes. For baby clothes. That's right. Get my hands on some of those hand-me-downs. Mm-hmm. What are those gifts I got? Yeah. Yeah. I need those back. Hand-me-downs of hand-me-downs, yeah. I literally was like, I should just sell some of the old baby clothing on Depop. Not a bad idea. And then I was like, nah, these childless hoes ain't gonna want none of that. Yeah, on Depop, you could consign it to the real real. They take baby clothes? I got many of those gingham pants off the real real, like before he was even born. Oh, good to know. Yeah, that's a good place to get. They're so pushy. The consignment people. Yeah, and annoying over at the real real. I know. They send you a text and a follow-up text. They're like Donald Trump. Hey, I'm in your area. Yeah, they are like Donald Trump. Ever since I donated. I text you 5,000% more than I literally do. Is that even possible? I love that Paul Cupo got his DNA tests back the same day. And I told him in the group chat that he was gonna be 110% Italian. And sure enough. He's mad Italian. He's the most Italian guy. Yeah, not the 91%, that's high, but that's not. But as Amber said, that's like even more Italian than being 100% Italian. Because the real Italians are a little bit. Yeah, they're all Balkan dogs. Exactly. Yeah, there was really no surprises with my DNA. Everything that I expected, I got. You were 50% 49. I'm 50.5% Iranian, Caucasian and Mesopotamian. Like 36.2% like Slavic, Russian and 12.8% Ashkenazi Jewish. Which I'm frankly surprised by, because part of the reason that I even did this DNA test aside from being an impressionable woman, who was just, you know, mimetically copying you. Yeah. I was like, I don't know, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Being you, yeah. Was that I wanted to also compare and contrast my results to my sisters, because she did 23 and me like four years ago and her, she's two percentage points. Less Ashkenazi. Wow, very interesting. It's super interesting, yeah. Okay. Though you would think that that would reflect in IQ, but it really doesn't, because she's definitely the smarter one. She might be the smarter one, yeah. But yeah, she's less Ashkenazi, which makes sense, because she looks a lot more like my maternal grandmother and I look a lot more like my maternal grandfather, so I clearly inherited more of his genome or whatever. I was like on, immediately took to the DMs and was like, Razeeb, tell me more. But we can wait to unpack all this, because we should just like have him on at this point. We should get him on. Logo's coming, didn't you think? Yeah, yeah. Which no one wants, but they're gonna get. Yeah. Sorry. How do you do, fellow Christians? Yeah, we have, me and Logo have some talking to do about the one true church. I told Razeeb that he's gonna have to explain what recombination and haplogroups are. Haplogroups, yes. I was looking up the haplogroups because they gave me like my maternal haplogroup, but then they said. 23andMe is way better than Ancestry.com, I gotta say. You should do it. And also honestly, you get 20% off a second kit so you can get one for Matthew. Cute, yeah. I was gonna get one for Eli because they had this promo going and we were fighting at the time and he was like, whatever, I don't want a kit. So I was like, okay, fine. And now he regrets it. You're a loss for real. Paternal haplogroups identify ancient lines of men that all trace back to the same common ancestor, not available, although women inherit roughly 50% of their DNA from their fathers, they do not inherit the Y chromosome and as a result, do not have paternal haplogroups. I felt so. Women do not have. No, I felt so shafted. I was like, I want to be part of like a quote ancient line of men. Hello, Bap. Yeah. Hello. I want to know what my- You're a total Bronze Age pervert confirmed. I was a Greek god. Okay, good to know. Yeah, I didn't even get to get into any of the haplogroups. So on ancestry.com, did they break down like all the regions and provinces that your people were from? Not in the detail of, well, I showed you, it said like Ukraine and Belarus, but then Razib told me that they don't even... It's like the fifth episode we've done where we are talking about. It's a talk about Razib. He likes it. Of course, yeah. But none of our listeners do. No, they are tired of hearing about the minutia of our DNA test results. But, you know, it's our podcast and we make the rules. So true. Yeah, they, I looked at the breakdown of- What's your maternal haplogroup then? Let's see, I'll look it up. The Longhouse. Yeah. Wow, the Longhouse. The Longhouse in action. And they say we live in a patriarch. And we can't even find out our paternal haplogroup. Like your haplogroup, your maternal haplogroup is spittoon wielding Asian matriarch who belittles clerk husband. I looked at- Tiger mom. My maternal haplogroup, if this means anything to anyone, is at UB40. No, it's Ufa, a shitty Gen X joke. Red, red, white? Red, red, white. That guy was hot. It's U5, B1, B1A. What, dude? I don't fucking know. Come on. I don't know, I don't know, that's not, yeah. Okay. But the Ashkenazi Jewish, I'm going to have to take a big L on this one, is it's all Central European, Western Ukraine, Southeastern Poland, Eastern Poland, Lithuania, Belarus. So I'm merely a lowly peasant, longhouse potato Jew and not the high German Jew, I was led to believe. You thought that you were? Well, because my family was not settled within the pale. They lived within the city limits of Riga. Okay. And they were all doctors and came from a nice upper middle class family and we have this very fancy German name, Rainberg. So I was like delusionally missled. No, I could have told you. You were like, I can spot him from a mile away. So, yeah. That was my one bargaining chip, you know, to Lord over Eli, because I was like, haha, you're just a lowly Polish and Ukrainian Jew and I'm a high German Jew. No. Yeah, no. Poor Lenny. I take that all, yeah. Yeah, he's, he's like literally, he's like 60% Zalonsky. Get that baby a DNA test. Can you, can you make a baby? I guess you could hypothetically get a baby to generate enough saliva to like spit in the cup, but there's like just like food chunks up in there and like fecal matter or whatever babies are picking up off the ground. You don't. Yeah. But I'll get the 23 and we will pick this up where we left off. Yeah, yeah. Well, I really want Eli to do one and I want Lenny to do one so that I can have a new means of Lording over Eli because I guarantee you the kid inherited more genetic material for me. I, well, the babies, well, babies do inherit their mitochondrial DNA from their mother. So all babies are slightly more their mother than they are their father. Is that true? Yeah, I think so. I'm going to need Rezeb to confirm yet again. Well, they also have the in whole, in utero thing. Right. That just makes them. There, yeah, he got my HIV. Stop. And HPV. And the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. And the seed oil. It's good we know all that stuff. Yeah. That we've been learning online. I know we've become so much more knowledgeable since aligning ourselves with the right wing. I told my therapist about repeat today. And what do you say? He was, you know, I was like, anything sugar is actually not that bad for you. And he was like, okay. I was like, but he's not dogmatic. And it actually works for me because I'm just calorie deficient primarily. So I kind of just need like a patriarchal figure that doesn't feel too stifling to like give me vague nutritional guidance. Yeah. That I can just be like, man, maybe I'll have a soda. Fuck it. I'm on a health kit. I have that Van Luen cone and Mexican Coke. You know, I'm just a health nut. Yeah. Well, two glasses of orange juice for me today, please. Do you drink orange juice? I have been since I've been vaguely petered, but I didn't really before. I don't know. Cause I just had so much like analysis paralysis through the various like orthorexic. We'll get into eating disorder. Yeah. This is a big pro on this episode. But, you know, like I definitely have been like, I have to like starving, but being like, I have to eat something healthy. I have to say, I have to eat kale every day. And like choking down foods I didn't particularly want. That's why I like repeat because he says to eat like liver and stuff that I naturally am like disposed to. Yeah, exactly. It's like, well, cause he read up on all those Russian nutritionists. So his diet is actually weirdly very Russo inspired. I was doing like an interview recently and the guy was like, well, you know, it's fine and good to say that you find BAPS writing funny and entertaining. But that's often used as a means of dismissing his underlying program, which is rather alienating to most people because it calls for eugenical supremacy. So would you say that you're on board with that? Can you comfortably confirm that I'll get into it later? But why do you find BAPS so relatable? And I was like, literally, it's just that I really relate to his bit about getting so hungry that you get analysis paralysis and you can't decide where to go. And there's like a five guys in a Starbucks and you get so angry you just like don't eat anything because you want the meal that you have to be like worthwhile and good. Yeah. And you can't bear to eat some like bone dry prepackaged sandwich from starves. I mean, that's what I end up end up doing usually. Yeah. Yeah, I'm like delusion. I'd rather starve and then I go to like some bodega and buy one of those like refrigerated like protein bars. I eat Chipotle. So yeah, I really am. This is how much water I drink today. That's not good. Yeah. Well, you know, all Azaleas had to get one of those Nalgene that has like the little yardstick on the side. I thought that was a good little pro tip or life hack or whatever. I have a Nalgene that doesn't have the like hours of the day, but you know, I do kind of make up. But I left it at Matthew's house. Yeah. Days ago and since then I haven't. It's literally so hard to stay hydrated as a woman. How are you as a woman going to drink a glass of water? It's a Sisyphian battle. It's impossible. It sucks, man. Boo-hoo. We can't drink enough water. I'm rich and white. So hard to drink water. I'm disabled. Honestly. That's going to be my body positivity thing. I'm going to start like a thing like Alcoholics Anonymous, but for like people who are like perennially dehydrated. Yes. I will join. Because that's a disorder. It is. It's something's wrong with me. It's a disease. It's a syndrome. Well, I guess. Yeah. We're going to talk about this article in the New York Crimes about atypical anorexic. A.K. being a secretive and shame based fat person who binges. This is what's going to really get us canceled. Don't say it. Don't speak it. Because people are losers. And the one thing that really upsets them is not misogyny or racism or homophobia. It's speaking frankly about eating disorders. Yeah. It's true. It's always been. I saw like a really great thread the other day that I noted you were commenting on. Oh. Uh-huh. Where some right wing guy was like, there are only two acceptable female body types. And it's like literally thin and then curvy, but also thin. Like a little bit. A little bit. Yeah. More like, yeah. With like slightly wider hips. Yeah. There's all like a lot of right wing guys who have kind of like aesthetic mood board style accounts where they literally post like the gayest, like Tumblr core pics I've ever seen. Yeah. It's like a girl with a perfect wavy bob holding a tiny little espresso in like an Italian villa type landscape. And the one thing that really and they're like kind of like propping this up as like an image of natural beauty in a landscape of like leftist ugliness and depravity. And I'm just like, okay, but how can you not see that she has lip injections? Yeah. They literally cannot spot the minor like nips and tucks that women be having, which I don't, I'm just judging, but like you can always tell when a woman has lip injections because they have that like sausage lip that doesn't have any wrinkles. Yeah. Some girls get very tasteful. No, I know, I know. Well, but that's the whole thing with like any kind of like cosmetic intervention or plastic surgery. It's like the good work is invisible. So you can't really tell. Right. But like a lot of the stuff that's like bandied about as like a pinnacle of natural beauty is like literally augmented. Where do they find these pictures? I don't know. I don't know. They have to go on Pinterest or Tumblr, which like you gay. I'm sorry. It is. It's super, it's super gay. It's much gayer than like the physique posting is when they post like a gorgeous like villa with like some woman who clearly works out. Yeah. I don't know what that that is. Yeah. Well, he, uh, cause I posted a photo of me at the gym. Yeah. Wearing the revolver news teacher to famous Michelin Darren Beatty. Um, and lots of people said my knee looked weird. And when I was reading the New York crimes article about atypical anorexics talking about being fat shamed, I was like, I was like, yeah. A lot of people were sending me zoomed in photos of my kneecap and saying it looked kind of weird and that I'd actually didn't look strong in the pic. Um, they call me spaghetti legs. A gumby. Um, no, and then someone tagged me, that photo of me into that thread and then that guy was like, this girl doesn't need to go to the gym. She's the first acceptable body type, which I was like, so sweet. It's so true. But it's true. It's true. Dasha, you literally don't need to go to the gym because you're like literally naturally thin. If you go, it's for, uh, mood benefits, which is, yeah. And a point I made was that knots of naturally attractive women have, um, mental disorders and anxiety and stuff. And so they actually should go to the gym just to kind of work some of that stuff out. But also being skinny fat is real. Women can't just not exercise. Like skinny fat is also a type of fat and no one's ready for that conversation. I'm just spiritually obese. Just spiritually. Yeah. Me too. No, but like literally, I think if you're naturally thin, you don't need to go to the gym as a woman. You can get like a few steps in and like do some lightweight lifting in your own home. You should strengthen your core. No, I agree with that. I'm, I'm pro, I'm pro gym and pro fitness overall, but it was the first time that I saw a thread though, even though it was somewhat annoying and a couched in fake and gayness got to the heart of things in a truthful manner. Because the fact of the matter is a lot of women who are pretty and thin are naturally low, especially when they're young. Yeah, but you have to maintain your physique as no, I agree. I'm just going to slow down ladies. I'm a big, I mean, I don't think you should be like lifting necessarily more like in some kind of like gym cell mentality. Like I go to the gym twice a week. I could probably go once, you know, and then supplement with like a pull. I think Pilates. I'm really, I haven't done Pilates in a long time because I have been weight training, but I think Pilates is great. It's a really low impact workout. That's great also for like building lean muscle tone. I think it's awesome for women. It's great for there's prenatal Pilates. It's like you should strengthen your core. Everyone should. Yeah. Even if you're naturally thin. Yes. I think you will only benefit from some form of physical exercise. Yeah. Of course. Of course. I'm not, I'm not advocating that you like go on permanent bed rest and become like a chip eating diva. Cause I've been, yeah. But what I'm saying is that like, like painting with a broad brush in the general parameters of his insight, he is correct. That if you're naturally attractive and thin, you don't need to go to the gym. You don't, yeah. You don't have to like freak out and be like aggro or obsessive about your fitness habits. Yeah. Because it's, it's 90% diet anyway. That's probably true. My babysitter who's naturally thin and gorgeous told me that when she started cooking at home versus getting takeout, she lost 10 pounds just like naturally overnight. That's literally how it happens. Yeah. If you know, that's, that's very true. Yeah. So anyway, I'm just trying to make a point that people are very touchy and insecure about. Well, sure. Well, that, that thread was mad annoying. Yes. I mean, they're all annoying. Deliberately. They're all deliberately cringe and corny. I don't actually know if they're deliberately cringe and corny. I think that they're being kind of like renegades and speaking truth to power. They think that about themselves. I mean, no shade. That guy told me I was naturally thin and had an acceptable female body type. So as a natural pick me, I salute you, sir. Thank you for your, thank you for your service. Thanks for remarking on my physique. Thanks for noticing. I am naturally thin. A lot of people have made comments about me seeming like. I have disordered eating. I actually have something we touched upon earlier. Low executive function, which is not a, which is, of which my disordered eating is really a symptom, but I think that's the bigger like umbrella category of what's wrong with me. And people have made many snide comments over the years about how the anorexia was going to catch up with me and ruin my metabolism. Yeah. And still. Pretty. Still, still trucking. Yeah. So I don't know. Yeah. I mean, look, at the end of the day, your spiritual obesity will catch up with you. It catches up with all of us. Yeah. You get the, yeah. You get the face you deserve. Anyway, so the New York Times published yet another article. Very long. It was very long. It was in super long. You don't look anorexic. New research shows that our assumptions about eating disorders are often wrong. That many large bodied people are starving themselves. Once again, I must reiterate the key to reading the New York Times is reading it as an art or stob to maximize your enjoyment and pleasure. Yeah. You get mad at a term like large bodied when you can laugh at a term like large bodied. Yeah. A fat body is a political body. I learned in college. The very first sentence of the article, which focuses in particular on a woman named Sharon Maxwell. Which reminded me of that really hot model Stella Maxwell. That was cruel. Sharon Maxwell spent much of her life trying to make herself small and that immediately took me right back to, oh, by the way, Mills College, my formerly defunct women's university, no longer defunct, but now is called Mills College at Northeastern. So it got bought up by another larger institution. And I think it might be coed now, but I remember learning that feminist terminology of women make themselves smaller and spend their whole lives kind of crushing their bodies into submission to take up less space. And that really hitting hard in my teen mind is like, I was like, wow, yeah, it's so true. Patriarchy is real. Women are small. And that concept gets circled back to at the end of the article, which is about this woman, Sharon Maxwell's sort of recovery from what is called atypical anorexia nervosa, which basically means you have an eating disorder, but it's not working and you're still fat. Yeah. And then after at the end of the piece, once she takes control of the narrative and starts posting on social media, very cringe videos of her smashing her scale with a baseball bat. No, that was a different one. That was a different, it was like a black chick. It was Sharon Maxwell. It's confusing, but I was like, because I was like, wait, who did this? And it circled back to Sharon Maxwell towards the end of the article to kind of tie some of these ideas together. But it was, it was a real, it was a doozy. It was a real riot, a real hoot. You know, that quote, that's like, if you're, if you're not a liberal at 25, you have no heart. And if you're not a conservative at 35, you have no mind. Yeah. If you, I've heard it at 30 being the, yeah, like whatever. But if you don't believe in the patriarchy at 25, 15, 15, you have no heart. And if you still believe in the patriarchy at 25, you have no mind. Yeah. Like straight up. Straight up. Straight up. Yeah, yeah. Cause these, these frameworks and concepts are very compelling, right? Another one I was taught at my liberal arts school was that all heterosexual sex is rape. Andrea Dworkin, who I love by the way. I respect her. I respect Dworkin as well. She was a real juggernaut. Yeah. And that, she does the same thing that like, Polya does, which I also like where you kind of take something to it's like logical kind of outlandish conclusion. And I really always admire thinkers that do that even if they're like conclusions are a little like outlandish or far-fetched or contrarian. Well, because, because it reminds like their polemics are so obviously rooted in insecurity and lack, but you can say that and you should say that about any polemic. All polemics are rooted in insecurity and lack of sensing yourself as being different from others and suffering a gray moral fatigue and psychological torment because of it. But the difference between good polemics and bad polemics is that like good polemics universalize the particular and bad polemics like particularize the universal. Very true. And make it all about me, me, me, me. Ukraine, what about me? Well, in Dworkin's case, I mean, she was a very atypical anorexic lesbians and big old galoshes and overalls. I think in that way, she's, it's almost a good polemic because it's not like she was ever a victim of, you know, male desire, you know? Yeah, that's true. Yeah, but that's, but that's why she was, that's why she's so mad. She a lesbian. Yeah, but she's only a lesbian. Dworkin was only, I mean, she lived with a man for a long time. She was probably gay, but I think she was only a lesbian because she sensed herself very acutely and urgently to like not be an object of male desire. And I think it's very easy in those kind of instances to like chalk it up to like external forces. I think it's a chicken or egg kind of thing. Yeah, it is, it is, it is. Yeah, but, but it's really just like your attitude. People chalk things up to external forces that are merely a question of personal attitude and personal responsibility because most, most other people are really like not that observant and you can literally get away with anything. It's like, you know, I said it in the early days of the podcast, like the easiest way to get people to think you're hot is to like stay not only directly, but mostly indirectly that you're hot and they'll just believe you. You don't really have to be like objectively attractive. That's true. Yeah. I mean, it helps. It helps, but it's not the be-all and end-all. It helps to have one of the two acceptable female bodies. Yeah, it does, yeah, yeah. That's the other thing that I was confused about with that thread because he said, you know, like there's two acceptable female body types and they don't naturally have to work out. So does that mean that the other unacceptable body types have to work out? I guess. Yeah. Like do they have to sweat it out at the gym? Some people have to work harder, I guess. Like if you're naturally like Apple shaped, but, you know, right off the bat before even getting into the nitty gritty of the article, like it's very apparent also that like most obese people are like malnourished and starving themselves. Well, technically, yes, they are because even though they're operating at a caloric surplus, they're clearly operating at a nutritional deficit because they're not getting the nutrients that they need and that's probably like a function of both nature and nurture. Like they're maybe genetically predisposed to not make use of those nutrients. Yeah, but they're also not consuming enough of them. Genes are a big part of it. I mean, I came away from this article, which sort of sought out to make the case that, you know, anorexia doesn't always look like what we think it looks like and that there's a wide range of kinds of people who are afflicted with it. And I came away with being like, oh, anorexia is fake. Like this is, to me, it really made the case of like, oh, this is a kind of medicalized category of pathological behavior that I think is real, like bell curve style, like in the extremes, but the way that we use the term to refer to basically any sort of like disordered eating or like even like obsessive compulsive disorder attitude towards food as all being part of this like anorexia nervosa symptomology. It made me feel like the whole thing was was fake. I know, but that's what they want you to think. Is that what they want you to think? Or do they want you to think that anyone can be susceptible to this whole idea where they say like, to make it easier for people with atypical anorexia to be screen treated and insured, there's a growing movement in the field to collapse the categories of anorexia and atypical anorexia into one to no longer see them as separate illnesses to decouple anorexia from its virtually synonymous association with thinness, many, however, fiercely resistant to letting go of the metric of weight, it would require altering the organizing principle by which the public and the greater medical field conceive of the condition. It would also require recognizing that anyone in any body can starve themselves into poor health and you'd never know it by looking at them. And it's like, well, okay, first of all, clearly as they themselves point out, the effects of the extreme malnourishment that you experience with the anorexia are compounded by the burden of living in an overweight body that you experience with like morbid obesity. Right. The health effects are worsened if you're like starving yourself, but also that. Right. But also. But collapsing them into a category just feels like more like making it into like an identity that people are entitled to claim regardless of. Yes. Well, it's like with everything. It's again, like the culture of narcissism, the narcissist society. We have to make these clinical definitions, which are imperfect to begin with, bend to our subjective self perception, right? You know, it feels very political. Well, it's a very sinister article to write in light of the like obesity rates and well, yeah, they're getting they're effectively getting to the fact that obesity is a much more widespread and common eating disorder. But in this like backhanded and ideological way, because actually the real eating disorders is obesity. Yeah. And anorexia is like a bad and scary and profoundly fatal disorder, but it's a small fringe of disordered eating across the board. Yeah. And like, again, collapsing the taxonomy muddles all of that. And it's it is very like in line with our open borders culture, which is actually a borderline culture that's that's like literally my my central pseudo intellectual update. On Christopher Lash and TLP and this whole like discourse about narcissism is that we've moved past narcissism into borderline. The predominant personality type that you see in the culture is a borderline personality. It's a hostage crisis. Yeah. Yeah. It's literally, yeah. And where the hostage is. And then yeah, I'm just like, can't I be a typical anorexic in peace? Why all these fat people have to, I'm kidding, but that's that's kind of that's what the article would like you to believe is the predominant disposition of these eating disorder clinics and stuff. It goes on to like describe the various experiences these atypical anorexics have at eating disorder facilities for their place with like precipitously thin and some girls like I'd rather die than be fat. But obviously those I saw Taylor Swift, I guess put out a new album today, which I have not listened to, obviously. But apparently she has a song that makes reference to her own kind of disordered body image. And I saw some like fat positivity activists on Twitter complaining about there being a scene in one of the music videos where she's looking at a scale and it says fat and it's like that meme of like a girl looking in the mirror and it's like Danny DeVito. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And they were making the case that like how, how would you think it would feel for someone to say that they would hate to be to look like you to be fat and stuff. And it's like, well, that's what an eating disorder is by definition. Fat phobic. Yeah. And you can't, you can't, if we're going to be collapsing all these categories and like valorizing mental illness along with obesity, it's like you're going to get a lot of mixed messages people. This makes me think of like that transphobia test that you did and I dropped halfway because I was like, I just like, there's some things I don't want to know about myself. And then I was like, oh, shit, like I really am transphobic in the literal sense of the word. I don't hate trans people. I'm afraid of them because I'm afraid that I might say something wrong and upset them or like they might misread my intention. I like literally live in fear of, I'm so scared of like misgendering you. Well, that's what happens. What if I overst... Like, and I was like, I'm literally like transphobic. Awesome. Yeah, and that you're a trans person's hostage and they're very mentally ill and you don't know what they might do. Yeah. So you like walk on eggshells. But yeah, anorexia I think is like a very interesting disease as Renee Gerard said in that essay that was posted on the sub because it obviously involves a great deal of discipline and like it's discipline that we all wish we had in one way or another, but that we, which we recognize in this specific context as being horribly and tragically misguided and misallocated, right? And like, so it seems like, you know, extreme thinness, this criteria of thinness that applies to anorexia clinically is a shorthand symbolically for discipline. I sound like Jordan Peterson now, I'm like, what do you mean by believe? And what do you mean by in and what do you mean by God? When you say, I believe in God, that's a statement that needs to be unpacked. But you know what I'm saying, like, and it seems like the people who present with atypical anorexia, much like the rest of us in general lack the discipline required of the true anorexic who was doomed to a prison of psychic torment that like literally nobody wants, by the way. And that again, very few people legitimately can achieve, can achieve, yeah, I wouldn't say achieve. Well, I don't mean that in a positive way, I mean that in a literal neutral sense, yeah, whatever, the article also did something very interesting from the jump, wherein describing Sharon Maxwell's upbringing mentioned that her family belonged to a fundamentalist Baptist mega church where gluttony was seen as a sin to eat at home was to navigate a labyrinth of rules and restrictions. Soon after that, it says it makes some reference to religious fasting. During periods of religious fasting at her church, she would take the practice to an extreme consuming nothing but water for days. And then it does a couple other times make weird like anti, they had a real anti-christian sentiment kind of from the, from the beginning. Well, that's, that's just typical NYT because it's like a libtard atheism light. Exactly. So any sort of religiosity is associated with quote, mega churches and quote evangelicals and the Bush era. Exactly. That's yeah. But a lot of this does begin at home with parents who have like a shame based. But it has nothing to do with them belonging to a Baptist mega church, nor is gluttony a sin particular to like evangelical Christians, but that's what I mean when I say spiritual leftism. It's this, this attempt to launder any questions of like personal desire, personal responsibility off as like the, you know, like your victimhood at the hands of external forces, like church leaders or authoritarian strong men or quote, the patriarchy and the male gaze and like a religious fast thing. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, it's true that like the nutritional kind of dietary guidelines when we were growing up were completely bonkers. Like there was like that fat free craze and, and the food pyramid with the bread on it. And I remember, I mean, I know a lot of people who are overweight now who testified to having the same experience as children, having these diet obsessed parents, specifically mothers who were really into like skim milk, and they would have like a heaping bowl of sugary cereal with skim milk. Right. Right. And there was a real push by like the carb lobby to, to promote cereal as healthy, which is ridiculous. I mean, I wonder what, I don't know. I feel like culture has become so fragmented now that there isn't even like a coherent sort of mainstream ideology around nutrition, really. No. And you have all these like weird fringe beliefs, like rape, heat and egg slonking. Yeah. They also seem like wacky and farfetched. I'm curious about how much of atypical anorexia is just bulimia. Because you know, later on in this article, they mentioned how Maxwell's esophagus is like damaged from years of purging. So she's a bulimic and they say 36% of people with anorexia develop bulimia at some point and 27% of people with bulimia develop anorexia according to one study. But that's also like very much like the typical like bog standard New York Times model of journalism where they're like writing dubious studies, anecdotal evidence about fat shaming that they claim to that is happening. Yes. It's very much like the Daily Mail light, but with a lot of like moral and scientific and intellectual pretensions, like they'll basically present some like culture war like hot item in self-censoring language and let the photos do the talking. They'll present like photos of fat people, offer them up for mockery and ridicule. And when they are summarily mocked and ridiculed on the internet, we'll like backpedal and be like, oh, well, we live in like an ablest and fat phobic and patriarchal society that's like concerned with like body shaming and it's like, you did this, you know, yeah. I mean, the article makes reference to that like one of the subjects being shown that like meme image of the fat Italian guy wearing the I beat anorexia t shirt and then mean while the article is paired with like a photo of a, you know, overweight woman that says you don't look anorexia, it's like begging the suggestion. Yeah, it's begging people on Twitter to make to make right wing threads about how she's a pig who doesn't deserve to get fucked like literally. And I love this. Almost all of my colleagues were at capacity says Shira Rose and Bluth and eating disorder therapists who specialize in size and gender diverse clients. It's really it's hilarious how she hits them with the I'm at capacity line. But when I look at I looked at the photos of this like Sharon Maxwell and Shira Rose and Bluth and I was I was struck by the fact that they weren't merely obese, but they had this very specific body type, which is like apple shaped with a large midsection and toothpick legs. Almost everybody in the story had that that body shape. And it reminded me of that conversation we had on the last episode about plum plummeting testosterone levels and sperm counts in men and like the flip side corollary of PCOS in women. Yeah. Yeah. And PCOS, as you know, often presents in virilizing symptoms or with virilizing symptoms. So midsection weight gain. They mentioned PCOS. Yeah. Briefly. Access body hair, elevated levels of free testosterone in the blood. Like basically PCOS is a condition where a woman androgynizes or virilizes. Right. But in reality, what it is, is a condition of insulin resistance. PCOS is basically prediabetes. Oh. Yes. So this, this very typical body type that you see, that's not merely obese. It's not like a stacked pog. It's an apple shape is just insulin resistance. And you see this in women and men in America. And it's very funny that they talk about how like atypical anorexia is, is higher in women than it is in men, obviously, because eating disorders are higher in women than men, but it's also very high in quote, non-binary people. Yeah. For non-binary people, the number jumps as high as seven point. Yeah. The estimate suggests that 4.9% of the female population will have the disorder. Yeah. So non-binary people, the number jumps to as high as 7.5%. Yeah. And, and of course this is very dicey because non-binary is like a self descriptor and means literally nothing. Well, as is anorexic, honestly. I think anorexic probably has like a clinical definition. It has a clinical definition, but I think with the data that they're using, it's also like literally I've starved myself like who among us hasn't skipped a meal. Sure. Yeah. And I think like, I don't know, there's a case to be made for the kind of like self-reporting that these studies pull from where like, well, it is, yeah, it's self-reporting. If you're likely, if you're more likely to identify as non-binary, you're also likely to probably identify with like a slew of like psychopathologies. Well, right. My long winded, wind baggy argument that I'm trying to make is that they aren't making in this article like statistical predictions based on your self-reported non-binary status, but it cuts both ways because when you are a sufferer of insulin resistance, you are literally functionally becoming more non-binary whether or not you accept the status because the fatter you get, the more virilized, the more androgynous you get, the less sex differentiation there is. Yeah. Fat people all kind of like approach a mean. The men become women and the women become men. That's why also like when you think of like trans activism, it's very laughable to me in a certain regard because like as the country gets more and more obese, people are all becoming more and more functionally trans. Like obesity literally hampers sexual differentiation as does by the way extreme thinness. They mentioned that if you're like extremely malnourished and emaciated, your body stops producing sex hormones because it's in like fight or flight mode and it's concerned with like mere survival. And that's part of the narrative that gets conflated I think also with talk of anorexia and in particular in the extremes, I think the bell curve of anorexic like behavior will basically conform with women engaging in some form of like restrictive or disordered eating in order to achieve some mimetic standard of beauty. But in the extremes, I think you see real at like anorexics typically have some kind of like early childhood or like sexual trauma that causes them to like tragically starve themselves like Fiona Apple. Oh, because she was molested. Famed anorexic who like starved herself specifically to suppress kind of differentiating sexual characteristics. They want to they want to like kind of preserve themselves in the amber of childhood forever where they're not they're afraid to become yeah, they're afraid to like they associate like but in a perverse way, they have to like revisit the scene of the crime. Yeah, I know it's it's super it's it's very twisted and sad. But also, yeah, sorry, go ahead with with, you know, legitimate extreme anorexia, it is a kind of like lashing out, I think against well, right, certain like experiences one has had, like, as a sexualized or like a child, yeah, that I mean, that's interesting. I want to ask Dr. Drew about this because on the flip side, when I look at the photos of these fat women, who are also invariably tattooed or have piercings, I think I look at them and I think molested as a child, something happened to you as a child like dead. It's like the voice test. Interesting. So yeah, maybe, maybe that's the real argument. I just like made the argument for collapsing the typical anorexia like they've all been molested as children. Make it a same clinical definition in the DSM. I think you're onto something with the, but the, that woman, what's her name, Aaron Harrop, the other woman who was in the article, the large tattooed one, that's a they them. I was like, you were, you were clearly molested as a child. And it's like, okay, I don't, I know, no, I don't mean that in a mean or pejorative way. Like I'm very sympathetic to it. It's like all of these people are experiencing major, major psychological pain and torment. They're not happy people and like that's, that's why I also get angry at the New York Times for offering these people up for us to mock and ridicule because it's our job to mock and ridicule them. You don't get to know it's disgusting. It's disgusting with what the New York Times does where they literally offer these people up for mockery and ridicule and then they say, who me, we were just, we were just doing the report. We were just doing investigative reporting with experts and fact checkers in like politically correct language. It's really like disgusting and despicable because they seed, they encourage people to have like festering, unflattering thoughts. Sure. Yeah. That's literally their job. That's what journalism is in this day and age. It's encouraging people to jump to paranoid conclusions based on the available data. Yeah. But I don't even think it's intentional. I think they're, what's a, it's like a business model. They follow. Yeah. They're useless idea. It's following. Like I'm drinking my Spanish wine and coke. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. That DC. But yeah, I look at these women and I think like they're in a lot of like pain and discomfort. I think it is possible. I mean, obviously there is disorder eating going on and it is possible to starve yourself and you know, have co-symptomology with anorexia while being overweight. I don't think it is as straightforward as like looking at someone and being like, wow, you're too thin. Let's get you off to the eating disorder war. You're too fat and you don't qualify for like insurance or programs or whatever. But I said this early on in the pod and it caught me a lot of flak, but anorexics are really the ultimate aggressors masquerading as victims. And I don't say that exclusively or pejoratively, right? They don't know very often what they're doing. And it's obviously like a disease of relatively high IQ, relatively middle class white women primarily, though now you're seeing a lot of like now anyone can have it and now it's like cashmere. It was originally a luxury item and now it became a quote luxury item that any like peon can buy off the rack at TJ max. Well, that's also part of it. Sorry. Yeah. No, no, no, go ahead. There's a romantic disorder to have that there is also, I haven't read the Gerard piece in full disclosure, but I think there's almost like a mimetic desire not for thinness, but for like being categorically anorexic because you get to have like, you get to incorporate like a tragic disorder narrative into your life. I mean, it was the original disorder of the female saints. Exactly. Anorexia mirabilis. Exactly. And religious, I do take umbrage with the like offhand dismissal of like religious fasting because I think it's an attack on discipline and religious fasting doesn't necessarily have it's not it's not anorexic. It's literally about like denying yourself something that you might want in a fortify yourself spiritually. Yes. I no, no, I understand and I agree with that, but and I'm not a big fan of like, um, applying contemporary moral standards to, um, historical figures or events, i.e. like historical revisionism. But when you hear these accounts of female saints who starve themselves, you can see kind of, uh, the, the, the lifeblood of like feminine civil disobedience of like topping from the bottom, passive aggressive manipulation, emotional terrorism, emotional extortion in the name of religion back then, because that was the going, that was the ideological framework. Now we do it in the name of like, uh, Somalia and Sudan, like Mia Farrow, that was, that was like 90s, 2000s, like political causes. In this day and age, it's probably like in the name of like body positivity, whatever. But when I say like, anorexics or aggressors masquerading as victims, I don't mean that they don't have a serious illness and I don't mean that they're, they shouldn't be taken seriously and treated with fairness and compassion. I just mean that they are also like misallocating their tremendous energy and resources into this. Who was the guy who like, uh, came up with like the clinical definition of anorexia called it perversion of the ego. This was cited in there. Sir William with the gull in English position who coined the term in the late 1800s called it a perversion of the ego. And it's a, it's a weird backhanded way of making yourself big by making yourself small. When you look at what eating disorders do in a family setting, for instance, like you take up space by not taking up space, right? Yeah. You, you extract. It's a power move. Yeah. Yeah. Especially, which is why it's so prevalent in like teen girls who are uniquely kind of disempowered in this, in this way. It's a real. Well, and in middle class educated teen girls from, from, you know, relatively nice well-to-do families where the going mode of like intercourse, not sexual, but like emotional intercourse is passive aggression and cordiality, right? Where there is actually no intimacy and warmth. Yeah. Like it's so obvious that like what I'm saying is like, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not saying that these people should be like cast out of society, exiled, they don't deserve treatment or like pieces of shit. That's not what I'm saying at all. It's a very backhandedly aggressive stance, which is why anorexia and all eating disorders are primarily a female affliction and why men generally don't have them. Yes. And to be the libtard devil's advocate, even though I don't truly even necessarily believe it, but like you can make the case, right? But that is also because of like pain, drunken beauty standards and blah, blah. But I think it's really, I don't think men impose beauty standards. Women impose that beauty standards. All this, this John Berger thing that like feminists love, they love the, the men watch and women watch themselves being watched line because it's, it's very sexy and enticing and almost feels like a spy thriller starring Gene Hackman, but also gives you kind of plausible deniability through its like Marxist reading. And then he puts a mirror in her hand and calls it vanity when he like, you know, paints or photographs her nude and realistically, women are the ones driving the draconian unrealistic beauty standards. Women don't care as long as you have like a reasonably nice demeanor and pretty face. They literally don't give a shit. If you've got a hole, yeah, someone, there will be a man to put it in you. I mean, that was really my, I didn't chime in because sometimes it doesn't, it's not worth it for me to get involved in the discourse, but with that, the right stuff, dating app yeah, a fat girl right wing backlash thing. I was like, a lot of men just dead ass like that. Like, they, they're, they're literally, they're like, Oh no, the state, not the state making me have sex with this smoke and hot fat girl with a natural hourglass who's also fat and wearing high-waisted jeans. No, not this date making me like, first of all, black guys can be conservative too. What are you saying that they're, they're all chubby chasers? Well, I'm doing, that's, you know, that's, it's an easy joke, but I'm just kidding. But did you see ACON is starting his own city in Africa? I did see that. Yeah. Very, very cool. Do you think that he would invite us? No. Why not? Why not? Why not? I'm an ACON fan. We'd have to become atypical anorexics to get invited to down on the feet. That's so true. We have to gain 30 pounds. I would gain 30 pounds to get invited to ACON's Senegalese city with a state-of-the-art 10,000 bed hospital. I might. I'll think about it. Um, what was, what were we saying? Um, the, the fat girl dating, or the right-wing dating after? Oh yeah, just like, yeah, just like, legit, legit, man, legitimately, look, I don't like it either, but men do like that kind of body type. They literally do. Yeah. Um, they, they, they just do it, but the point you were making prior to that was that you just have to have a nice demeanor, something, something. Men don't create beauty standards. Women do. We talk so much about, so much ink has been spilled about the quote, male gaze. We need to talk about the female gaze. There's no such thing as the male gaze. It's fake and gay. Well, the only male gaze is, is, uh, one man gazing lasciviously and, uh, upon another man's gains at the gym. That's the male gaze. Uh, who are also happened to be literal. Yay. Yeah. Um, right. Much like the male gaze, I also, whenever these little like, uh, body positivity pieces come out, whenever anyone details like their run-ins with fat phobia in the real world, obviously people on the internet say all sorts of horrible stuff about someone's knee cap or whatever. All sorts of falsehoods they're willing to spread about someone's, uh, body, all various attacks, but, um, early. One's asymmetries, one's asymmetries, weird moles, you know, people will say all sorts of horrible stuff online. Um, yeah, in this piece, it talks about, um, what's her, I keep wanting to say Sharon Maxwell. Sorry. You keep wanting to say Stella Maxwell. Now you put it in my head. I keep wanting to say Stella Maxwell. Sharon. Well, um, describes like going to the grocery store and people chiming in on the contents of her cart, people calling her names like pig and fatty and it's like, I just don't buy it. I don't buy it as much as I buy the male gaze. It's woke toddler syndrome. It's like when, during the, the, the pinnacle of like TDS, when people were like, my toddler turned to me. I said, Wakanda forever. Yeah. And it was like, yeah, like some three or four year old being like, if they overturned Roe v. Wade in the future, I'm becoming a jurist and you're just like, Oh, okay. Exactly. It's like, first of all, like one in four, three to four people are obese in America. Yeah. So why would they be fat shaming each other doesn't add up. It's delusional. Second of all, everyone's a narcissist. So definitely no one cares about what's in someone else's car. Have you ever like gone to a grocery store and like looked at somebody else's shopping cart? What are you talking about? Exactly. It's a, it's a fantasy of oppression made to buttress the fat positivity movement and I just cannot, yeah, I cannot stand, stand by it. Here's, this is a tweet that was like went mini viral on Twitter recently. I've been subject to countless microaggressions. I've been coughed on by a group of teenage boys. I've been tutted at by old ladies who are somehow not afraid of white unmasked Swedes but are terrified of me by a cat zoo, the Asian girl, the Asian, yeah, who's getting harassed by clearly Balkan. Yeah, I know. It's like some guy who's like, clearly Croatian, she's like, look at this racist sweet. And it's like, it's like literally, I'm like, wait, I know that guy Croatian. Yeah, that thread was, was crazy. That gave me a real paranoid feeling. It's, yeah, it's so, that's the big, it's so delusional where these people like invent wholesale narratives in their head where they're like, somebody called me piggy or fatty at the gross. They really didn't have a cashew shaped head. They said my mold was unsightly and that Anna looked managed. No, people, by the way, people send me so many like horrible, unseemly DMs because they feel licensed to like psychoanalyze me because I think they, they feel like they're matching my rhetoric. And I think it's like, okay, it's like upsetting in the moment, but it's also like funny and retarded. I don't care. And when I was 14 or 15 years old, this janitor at my high school stopped me in the hallway. I was very busty. Repressed memory. And he said, go back to your own country, sand, boop. And I remember like literally laughing out loud because I thought it was so funny because this guy was black Irish, but he straight up looked Arab and he was shorter than me. I'm not very tall. And it was like, he's clearly like lashing out out of like some like psychosexual impulse. He called you a sand boop. Yeah. Yes, he did. In my high school, which sounds like a thing that didn't happen. I know that sounds delusional crazy, but I thought it was so funny. Have you ever been oppressed by racism? I think it's hilarious and not because it fuels my like weird immigrant superiority complex because it's literally just funny because you're like literally all of us are nothing and nobody. No lives matter. We're all mere mortal meat suit losers who are going to die in the end. We will all die alone. Even if we have kids and grandkids, that's why I don't like the right wing trap thing when they're like your only legacy is having moved to a farm and have a trad wife with kids and grandkids. It's like also with some tumblr ass image they found of some like your kids and grandkids aren't going to save you. They're all going to be trans. Are you talking about loser and hate you for being conservative and raising them on some demented farm that you can can barely manage? You're getting like Amazon packages shipped to you. I'm not moving to a fucking farm. I don't care. That's how you know I'm not really invested in any ideological drift because I'm like absolutely not. I'm like, I want to live in a nice apartment in a long island city, Lassie City, okay? On the Isle of Manhattan or Paris. You're like living on a farm raising like a farm farm fresh chickens and cows and some guy who looks like Trayvon Martin pulls up in the Amazon buggy to get you your toothpaste and like skincare products. I bought Marie's toothpaste. The girl. The girl. Oh, yeah. Yeah. The girl. She's fine. I like this girl. I like the poster girl. I love the girl who posts and who's hogging the toothpaste. And I bought it. She had a tweet that was like, people think my remineralization of your teeth thing is a bit. Yeah. And I was like, I never thought that for a minute. Like, I understand she's a troll and a shit poster, but that one thing felt like profoundly earnest. Definitely. Yeah. And just like a thing I felt, you know, I'll let you know how it is. Yeah. So, okay, what's the thing with the teeth? Fluoride is bad. Whatever. It makes you gay. It makes entrance. But isn't it in the water? Like, aren't I? It's in everything. When, when I was like last episode and I was like, hi guys, can you help me get clear skin and a flat stomach? Everybody was like, you need to get a filter for your water. And I was like, already have one filter on your phone and they were like, and they were like, no, you need to get a filter for your bathwater and I was like, no, I'm not doing that. No, it's too hard. I'm not a fucking loser. I mean, I am in many ways, but not in that way. I'm not living on a farm. I'm just going to put the Paris filter on my face. So true that you need to see it. It's called the Paris filter. If you swipe once on Instagram, we get, you'll get it. It just really smooths everything out. Don't fuck with the Jakarta filter or the Oslo filter. None of them. Paris. Paris all the way. The Paris Heinz filter. Of course. Just a nice, put Vaseline on the lens, just really soft in the edges. Another, one of the best pro tips that I can offer young Insta hose is to eat a lot of carbs because when you, when you be going to the bakery, the grease from the bread, the sourdough and the croissant gets on the phone and it makes your skin look extra luminous. It makes you look pregnant all the time. Down at la bourgeoisie. Yeah. The Mel Bakery. That's, yeah. That's solid. My phone. If you want to get some like, greasy fingerprints on the lens. My phone was definitely, is always mad oily whenever I'm in Europe and that's where I'm taking some of my flyest pics. Do we have any other thoughts on the, um, yeah, anything else we could, uh, well, okay. Can I just say one, one very annoying polemical thing. I think it's very undignified to have an eating disorder after, I'm going to be generous and charitable after 25, undignified. If you still have, if you still have an eating disorder after 25, you need to do a, a searching and fearless moral inventory. Yeah. Calorie counting also for losers. Definitely. You should, you should like literally just eat what you want in moderation. And figure it out. I mean, I, I don't know. I don't feel like I can, as a naturally than one person, I, I don't know. I, I don't know what it's like really to be like struggling with losing weight. So I can't, I have a lot of boo, boo. I just don't know what it's like. No, I mean, I, I, I have, I can empathize, but I can't like, I just don't. I think after a certain point, you have to accept yourself and you know, life is all the basic facts of life is that life is tragic and disappointing, which is also, it makes it beautiful and you have to accept that. Well said. And sometimes you, not all of us can be weight. I'm not a wave. I'm not a fucking wave, by the way. You're very thin. I'm thin, but I'm, I'm not a wave. I'm a sturdy chicken coop woman. I have a strong bone density and musculature. You have to like literally like accept what you are and, and roll with it. For sure. This is my biggest libtard take. I think women are beautiful in all shapes and sizes. I agree. Truly. Mm-hmm. I don't privilege waves. No, I, 100%, I am with you. I obviously have a soft spot for waves because they're more, it's my body, they reflect yourself, your subjective self-image and also your objective reality. I do not favor waves necessarily. I do not favor pogs. My hottest take also is that like waves and pogs are like also the pathological ends of a bell curve, like very few people fall within those categories. Most people fall in the middle. And I'm, I'm a big like believer in the, um, 90s Sharon Stone slash Madonna body type, which is like thin with small ish breasts and long legs, but like a nice handful, uh, Leticia Costa. I love her too, but she has, but she's, she's got the nice, nice rack. She's the, she's number two, a female acceptable body type. Oh, yeah. You know, I see this broad. Yeah. Okay. I like, I guess she's, she looks great. I like her weird janky teeth. She's incredible. And kind of asymmetrical face. She's beautiful. She aged very gracefully like, I love, wait, Dasha, I didn't know you were a Leticia Costa fan. I'm a big Leticia Costa fan. You got to follow this. And I love the name Leticia because it sounds kind of black underscore tribute account. It posts some rare Leticia picks that are all very, very nice. She looks good, but she also looks within the realm of human possibility. Right. I don't, what I find like literally disgusting and pathological, I'm sure I'm going to have a bunch of haters up in the comments being like, she is just else. I don't like the Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian cottage cheese ass augmented virtual reality hourglass. And I think there'll be a collective backlash kind of against that. Yeah. I like a basically attractive, athletic, natural female look. There's something, there's this aesthetic now that's like the lump in aesthetic. It's like the black China, Tweety bird, fleece, pants, okay, like ass injections, like Brazilian thing. Yeah. I see women at the gym with the fake ass and it does. It looks horrible. It's disgusting. It really is. It's disgusting. You look like a toddler who just shit in the diaper, a diaper. It's very, it's, I've never seen it tastefully done. I think it's, it's gross. It deforms the female body. It's just, it's not like anything I can imagine anyone wanting. It's not totally like porn sick and like auto-gynophilic on is honestly, it's like, it is. I think it's porn sick and auto-gynophilic. I think that's all, that's all like a spectrum, right? I think it's like the porn, if you get porn sick enough, you'll end up an auto-gynophile. That's true. But I always associate porn sickness with like the hyper-wafy anime thing. I think in the normie contingent, like, you know, I think, I don't think porn sickness is necessarily relegated to the extremely online kind of, but there's also no boundary to sexual pathology. That's true. And like, once you open that Pandora's box, it just like... But I think porn sickness is more prevalent than we even know, like amongst just the general population. What is porn sickness? Just like watching too much porn and becoming like, or watching porn at a very formative, you know, from a very formative age and then just having like some kind of warped and damaged sexuality because of it. Okay, I feel like I started watching porn at a very young age and I watch a lot of porn still, less so now because I'm like a rundown and beleaguered mother, but I don't know. I mean, like... I mean, I started watching porn fairly young, relatively unscathed, you know, I don't know. I don't have any like tremendous pathologies, certainly, but I think... I also think there's, you know, the lower IQ you are, it's just you can get overly sat. You know, luckily we were both very high IQ, we were able to differentiate. They need to figure out how to include an IQ test element in 23andMe slash Ancestry.com. Well, there's no way getting around just taking the test, they can't, they can't extract it. Eli and I did an IQ test together once and we scored extremely high, but that's only because we were working as a team. You combine horses as well. I bet Matthew and I would do really well. It was really fun. It was a lot of like puzzles. Yeah, totally. Yeah. Okay. That doesn't sound so hard. It was like a monkey discovers tools. I'm going to take one. Yeah. You should. I mean, it was exciting, erotic. My chess like ranking is really plummeted today. Wait, what's your chess rank? You have a chess ranking. Well, everyone on the... Grandmaster, Dosh. No, no, everyone on the chess app does. It'd be really funny if you became like a female grandmaster. It's not going to happen, dude. We should actually, we should actually bait Kasparov to come on the pod. I've got some thoughts on chess. I've got a lot of thoughts on Hans. I want to get Hans. Leave it on the pod. We could. We could. You know, he's after the failure and disappointment of bodega boy. I think it's only right. If I get ghosted on by Hans, I'll blow my brains out. How old is this person? Like 17. He's young. He's a baby. But he's got those Stanley Kubrick brows and he knows how to talk to women. And I watched some YouTube videos of him playing against me. I have a movie idea. Michael Tracy, a Stanley Kubrick. I love it. I'm going to make it happen. I don't know how Stanley Kubrick was murdered while making eyes for his eyes, starring Michael Tracy. He's like, autistically doing a race, realistic. I don't think he has the acting chops. I'm sorry to say it. Yeah. But okay, Michael, you know, I loved you. There's a type of guy. As I said, the standout talent of Uncut Gems was not Julia Fox, who was great, by the way. And like the role was tailor made for her. She did an incredible job is Kevin Garnett because he was not there in the capacity of an actor. He has no internal monologue. He's just like playing himself. So like Michael Tracy, who has no, he has no Hollywood ambitions, could really excel in the acting field. Well, it's very, it's, you know, it's because he's naive and childlike. It would be a very demanding shooting schedule and I just wouldn't want to deprive people of his post journalism. Exactly. Yeah. I might have to go with Michael Shannon or something inside, but Tracy's on the short list and I'd love to see it. I would. Can you just sit? Can you imagine Tracy as Kubrick, like workshopping Barry Linden? So it's an epic biopic. It's going to span his whole, yeah, I could. The spoke Zarathustra. We play that for the baby sometimes and he really likes it. What? The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. Yeah. They like hit you with the tool. They are like a little monk. Yeah they are little tricky goes. Geetoso. Um, that long have we been going. An hour 34. Oh, wow. So we don't have to talk about these disgusting sex positive pundits and politicians. No. I'd rather skip it. I don't like the stunt that the Sman polled. Yeah. It's all very stunt. it's giving something in the milk ain't clean. Mike, it kissed. And I read the thing that you sent me and it was like he was born in Odessa, Ukraine. They were trying to make some like Zelensky-esque Ukraine connection. I was like, he's just like a port noise complaint horny Jew loser. Well, I have kind of a bit of a tinfoil hat take that I'll mention briefly. Sure. Yeah, Mike, it kiss NYC congressional candidate who released like a sex tape because he's running on a ostensibly sex positive platform. He also has a military history. There was also this woman Alexandra M. Hunt who's also a congressional candidate. What's up with all the congressional candidates? She reports to be like a former stripper, though I'm sure she was not a real. I just don't. I don't buy it. She was like a children's party stripper. Yeah, she was a drag queen story hour performer. She had a thread much remarked on on Twitter this week. I think she's already lost her congressional race by the way. I think she's like trying to ratchet up engagement by posting about in seldom. Basically, she shared a chart that showed nearly a third of men under 30 have not had sex and a higher percent do not have as much sex as they'd like and said that our society criminalizes sex and sweeps down under the rug, blah, blah, men who do not have sex suffer. They are less likely to be a part of the labor force and more likely to experience depression, nihilism and other mental health issues. We should be moving towards a right to sex. People should be able to have sex when they feel they want to and we need to develop services that meet people's needs without attaching the baggage or shame of criminalization, blah, blah, blah. This was inspired higher from obviously both SJW types being like, are you saying that the government should be providing these horrible insults with blah, blah, blah, blah? With state mandated girlfriends. Exactly. Everybody gets a state assigned trans M to F girlfriend. If you ask for it or not, one just shows up at the door. Hostage crisis. It's like Samantha Pritchard at your door on demand. Boom, that's your girlfriend. Yeah. Enjoy the sex. No problem. You thought you wanted to have sex. Here you go, buddy. Now you do. You're never going to want to have sex. It's like when your parents catch you smoking, like you smoke a whole pack of cigarettes. That's what my dad did. That's why I'm such a chainsaw for now. A lot of trans people on the internet be like, Anna, you're just jealous because you don't pass as well as us. And I'm like, you know, it's so true, King. I really always wanted a second pussy where my chin was like John Travolta. I wanted to make myself more serviceable and available to men. The third hole. Fourth. Fourth. Sorry. Yeah. I literally had to do the math. Fourth hole is what I meant. Yeah. I don't know if I should even say my, my schizoid. Well, say it and then we'll cut it. We'll cut it later. We just can't cut it now. I've alluded to it too much. I have a dark feeling about the Ukraine stuff. Okay. Refugee, like obviously tons of sex slaves come from Eastern Europe. Having conflict in that region obviously is going to ratchet up the amount of like desperate women. Yeah. Trying to leave the region. I feel like they're going to like crank up the sex trafficking. And so there's some kind of sci-op-y push to like destigmatize sex work to like. Some more Ukrainian underage teens can. I feel like they want to collapse much like anorexia nervosa. They're the powers that be would love to collapse the categories of like sex slave and sex worker in an effort to like destigmatize. To say nothing of the 300,000 plus men that were conscripted by Putin and 700,000 who fled. I don't, I mean, I don't know where these Russian refugees are going. I doubt they're coming here because we're probably not allowing them. But if you guys want a Russian sex slave boyfriend, now it's probably your chance. I mean, that just isn't the market for it. But that is going to also, you know, part of the reason so many are becoming slaves yet again. Well, they have been part of the reason. So many male order brides come from Russia and Eastern Europe is because there is a massive disparity between men and women due to the like deaths of despair that happened during the collapse. There's more women. There's more women who then are forced kind of into basically sex work. Yeah. So they're, I don't know. And these women are unlike women in the West in that they don't suffer from atypical anorexia. They're just naturally thin. So they're, they're comfortable and desirable. They really, they're doing the thing by doing basically the minimum are able to do so. They don't even forget to eat because they're stressed out. They like literally just don't have access to food. So they're natural. They have natural and they're eager to my low BMI is marriage as a migration strategy. And that is to say nothing of like women who are legitimately like trafficked into international like sex trade ring prostitutes. Yeah. But I don't know. That was just kind of a hunch. I got from these two seemingly disparate Mike at kiss Mike at kiss and this woman Alexandra Hunt. I was like, we need to talk about sex. And I was like, she was trying. We literally don't need to talk about sex anymore because it's been talked about like a lot recently. It's nasty. And much like gluttony. It is a sin. Yeah. Everybody like everybody just like talks. Everybody talks about sex, but doesn't have it. Nobody be having it. Nobody be having it. These no pussy getting MFers are on my feed. I don't know. And she, yeah, back when she like had her congressional bid, she was sort of doing this like white AOC sex worker thing where she had like very AOC style shirts. So like elect hose and so she's just, I get really creepy Mackenzie vast vibes from her. And it gets that might just be some, you know, true partner's complaint style retard and the two are, you know, there is no congressional candidates. Yeah. This is how low our political culture has fallen. I know. Losers. Horses. Yeah. Just like deficience. Yeah. Horses degenerate. Inadequate losers. Yeah. Completely. Yeah. But this is AOC's fault. She used to blame. I, did you see the video of her getting hacked? No, no. It kind of endeared her to me, honestly. I lately have been thinking AOC looks good. Yeah. And I'm kind of like, what? I'm like, she seems at least higher functioning to me than. Okay. This new crop of retards. We've reached a new pinnacle where like, we've changed our tune on Hillary. We love her now. And so it's only natural that we change our tune. We're going to, we're becoming, we're becoming AOC stands. I, you know, she's legitimately her hair is looking glossy. I will say one thing about AOC. She is not dehydrated. She's not dehydrated. How does she do it? But she is refrigerator shaped. You don't have no. She does. She does not have an hour. I'm just saying. The waist-to-hip ratio isn't there. The knockers are nice. Yeah. But I, I'm not a knocker. I'm good for you. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a, I'm not a titty supremacist. Contrary to popular beliefs, people, people think I'm stealing big natural valor. I've never wanted breasts. I want bee stung bee cups so I can wear strapless top. Mimetic desire. Mimetic desire. And the best thing that happened to me is that after I finished breastfeeding the titties shrunk and now they are full on C cup and I can. C cup. Yes. Perfect per natural C cup. Nice. No need for bra. I love a small, elegant breast. Of course. Me too. You know, someone of the way fish persuasion. You secretly covet. Yeah. I do love to see like a big, huge, gorgeous pair of tits. Yeah. But this is a problem with women. This is why we're never going to be satisfied. And this is why we are spiritual leftists and bottomless voids is like the grass is always greener. Yeah. But much as you said about, you know, how it's undignified to have any eating disorder past 25. I stopped sort of coveting. You have to accept. You have to accept. Yeah. Okay. It's called playing to your strengths. You have to literally play to your strengths and just like, except, except who you are. Yeah. For sure. I know. Which is a rugged Latina. And that's just who she is. Okay. I literally went to the bodega today to get cigarettes, cafecito and some like young bloods were like scrapping outside and there was started, I was like, this is going to be the night that I get kept by a stray. I'm going to have to text Dasha that I can't podcast tonight because I'm bleeding out on the street. Oh no. Did I tell you I had a dream that there was an amazing statue of Steve Saylor in midtown? No. But there should be like a cause. I literally, I was like, no, it was like, it was like a George Floyd mirror. But it was Steve Saylor and he was like standing tall and in midtown and I was like, oh, nice. Dude, he's awesome. He's so good. I love when he goes off on Madaglacias. I saw a comment. I saw a post using that was like, it's interesting that Saylor says the majority of homicides are committed by black people because he's murdering Madaglacias regularly. I was like, he is kind of just killing him. Madaglacias, typical atypical anorexia sufferer. Absolutely. Yeah. We should have him on the pod talk about his eating habits. We need to go visit Bannon and jail is what we need to do. We will. Yeah. I think it's like Bannon should take the next four months and get super jacked. He should get yoked because can you imagine how unstoppable he would be if he had that tan and that head of hair, but like on a hot and if he exfoliated a little bit, we said we were going to bring him some and other stories, exfoliant and body butter. He's just, there's something wrong. It's not just skin deep. He is cute though. People were like, oh, how can you say like Brad Pitt is less attractive than Steve Bannon? I was like, if you Google Brad Pitt and Steve Bannon young photos, they are basically physically equivalent. Only one of them would choke you out with a belt. Girl. Look what's up. Girl, I'm looking at Steve Bannon young. He's got a ringer for Brad Pitt. Absolutely not, dude. He's got that. No, come on, like Ted Kaczynski, no, they have the same, they have the same like feathered Farrah Fawcett hair. He's got that tense mouth. He's stressed out. How you think Steve Bannon got the way he did? He's a stone called freak, dude. Oh, okay. He looks cute here. He's cute. When he gets the preppy looks, but like something bad happened to Steve when they laughed at him. He's a twisted and maladjusted individual. He is like, but we love him. We love him. We love him to death. He's sweet. Good luck in jail, Steve. That time's going to fly by. It will literally four months, that's nothing. I mean, I bet he's a raging alcoholic. Yeah, I think so too. So hopefully he has those dilated capillaries. Hopefully he doesn't have like wicked alcohol withdrawal in jail and like. Oh, he will. Maybe it'll be good for him. Maybe you'll have like a Dostoevsky in a moment and he'll come out kind of like better than ever. He's going to do, yeah. He's going to have his crime and punishment moment of like religious penance. Exactly. Yeah. I think like four months is going to do him good. Yeah. I'm just really hoping that he, you know, gets his, gets in shape, starts lifting. He should become a Muslim. I suggested that to you. That's a good way to bounce back. You can become a five percenter. One last thing about Kanye. Yeah. Okay. All right. Um, Alex Sabola said to me the other day, he said, there's a way, because I was like, we were talking about how Kanye can't stop going on the news and like he's, once he kind of took the lid off the anti-Semitic stuff now, he's just, he can't stop. Yeah. And like he's, I was saying that he's kind of being like thwarted at every turn in a way that's like confirming his worst suspicions about like who's doing it and stuff. And so it's all bad. Like it's like, it's just exacerbating his mental illness. Like it's never a good idea to do what he's doing. Um, and I was like, well, how could he, and Alex Sabola's was like, he can bounce back from this. And I was like, how? And he was like, if he said 30% of, um, African-Americans are unbanked and I'm unbanked now, if he did like an unbanked thing or like there are, there is, there are some kind of wire 30% of African-Americans unbanked. I don't know. Ask the Jews. Okay. We're done. We're done. We're done. It's over. It's over. It's over.",
