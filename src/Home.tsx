        In the example above, the text state variable is used to store the value
        of the input field. The handleChange function is triggered whenever the
        user types in the text field, updating the text state with the new
        value. The value of the input field is set to text, ensuring that the UI
        and the data model stay in sync. With this setup, any changes made in
        the input field will update the text state, which in turn updates the
        UI. Similarly, if you programmatically change the text state, the input
        field will reflect the new value. By utilizing controlled components and
        managing the state, you can achieve two-way data binding in React,
        allowing for a seamless synchronization of data between the UI and the
        data model. In the example above, the text state variable is used to
